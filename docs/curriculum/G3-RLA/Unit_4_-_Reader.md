“This is Rome,” said Mrs Teachwell, pointing to a
black dot on the classroom map


“But this is Rome too,” she added, as she traced a
circle that was so large it seemed to touch all four sides
of the map


The students looked confused


“How can it be both?” Charlie Chatter shouted out


“I’ll explain,” Mrs Teachwell said, “but please raise
your hand if you would like to speak ”


Charlie Chatter nodded It was not the first time he
had heard this In fact, Mrs Teachwell had asked him to
raise his hand many times, but it was hard for Charlie
His mouth seemed to be faster than his hand


“Rome started out as a little town along the Tiber
River,” Mrs Teachwell explained

_showing Rome_

“Like Egypt on the Nile?” Charlie asked


“Yes,” said Mrs Teachwell, “but let’s see that hand!”


The students giggled


“As Charlie has just reminded us,” Mrs Teachwell
said, “many **civilizations** spring up along the banks of
a river Rome was no exception It sprang up here, on
the banks of the Tiber River, among seven hills At first,
Rome was just a few houses on a hill Then, it grew and
grew and grew After a while, people started building
houses on other hills nearby Then, the little towns on
the hills grew together to make a big city In fact, to this
day, Rome is known as the ‘City of Seven Hills ’


“Then, the Romans fought wars with their
neighbors The Romans won most of these wars They
**defeated** the Etruscans, who lived north of them They
**conquered** the Greeks, who had settled to the south, as
well It wasn’t long before they controlled most of this
piece of land that we call Italy”


Mrs Teachwell traced the outline of Italy with her
finger

“Check it out!” Charlie Chatter shouted “Italy looks
like a boot!”


“Yes,” said Mrs Teachwell “Italy does look like a
boot, but please, Charlie, raise your hand! This is your
last warning Now, does anyone know what this body of
water that the boot of Italy sticks out into is called?”


Rachel Readmuch, who always had her nose in a
book, raised her hand Mrs Teachwell called on her


“It’s called the **Mediterranean**,” said Rachel


“That’s right!” said Mrs Teachwell “This is the
**Mediterranean** Sea Rome grew so much that, at its
**peak**, the Romans controlled all the land around the
**Mediterranean** Sea They took over most of Spain
and France They took over this area that we call the
Balkans They took over Greece and much of Turkey
They took over the Middle East, Egypt, and the coast
of North Africa Rome was a city, but that city was the
capital of a great **empire** ”


Tim Timetable, who loved to learn about when
things happened, put up his hand


“When was all this happening?”



7


“Rome started growing about two thousand five
hundred years ago,” Mrs Teachwell explained “It started
growing about five hundred years before the birth of
Jesus Christ, in the years we call **BC** for _before Christ_
It was still growing when Jesus was born In fact, Jesus
was born here, in a part of the Middle East that was
controlled by the Romans ”


Tim Timetable made a note of the date


Mrs Teachwell went on: “We will be studying Rome
for three weeks or so Each day, we will have a report on
a topic connected to ancient Rome I’ll give the first few
reports Then, each of you can do some research and give
the next few How does that sound?”


The kids cheered They were **eager** to learn more
about Rome Rachel Readmuch already knew quite a
lot Tim Timetable had lots of questions about what
happened when As for Charlie Chatter, he was looking
forward to the day when he would get to give his report
Then, he would get to talk without having to raise his
hand first!

###### **Roman** **Mythology**
# **2**



**Teachwell’s**
**Report**



Let’s learn about the mythical gods and goddesses of
Rome

In the early part of Rome, the empire promoted a belief
in many gods

In many ways, these mythical Roman gods acted like
human beings They ate and drank They played tricks
on each other They fell in love and got into fights But
there was one main way in which the gods were not like
human beings: the gods were **immortal** Human beings
might live for many years Some might even live to be
one hundred Eventually, though, they would die The
gods, on the other hand, lived forever They did not—
and could not—die

The Romans’ ideas about their mythical gods were
similar to the ancient Greeks In fact, they believed in
many of the same gods as the Greeks, but they called
them by different names The chart shows the Roman
names for some mythical Greek gods you may already
know


10


**Characters in Mythology**





















|Greek Roman<br>Name Name|Greek Roman<br>Name Name|
|---|---|
|Zeus<br>Jupiter|Ares<br>Mars|
|Hera<br>Juno|Hermes<br>Mercury<br>|
|Poseidon<br>Neptune|Bacchus<br> <br>Dionysus|
|Aphrodite<br>Venus|Athena<br>Minerva<br>|
|Eros<br>Cupid|Apollo<br>Apollo|


11


The top mythical god, sometimes called the father of
the **immortals**, was a strong, bearded figure The Greeks
called him Zeus The Romans called him Jupiter

Jupiter was portrayed as a mighty god He carried a
thunderbolt that he could throw at anyone who angered
him If Jupiter threw his thunderbolt at you, that was the
end of you

Jupiter lived on Mount Olympus with the other
mythical gods

_Jupiter was the father of the immortals._


12


Juno was Jupiter’s

the protector of wives


_mythical goddess of marriage._



13


There are many statues of Neptune In most of
them, he is holding a special, three-pronged spear called
a trident Neptune’s trident had magical powers He
could use it to stir up storms and waves He could also
wave it over the stormy seas and make the **rough** seas
smooth


Roman sailors spoke to Neptune “Great Neptune!”
they said “Send us good weather and smooth sailing!”


_Neptune, the mythical god of the seas, with his magical trident_


14


Mars was the mythical god of war Soldiers would
pray to him before a big battle The Romans fought a lot
of wars, so they spent a lot of time praying to Mars


_Mars was the mythical god of war._


15


Mercury was one of Jupiter and Juno’s sons He was
the **messenger** of the mythical gods He was as fast as a
flash In paintings, he is often shown with wings on his
hat and his shoes, to show how fast he was


_Mercury was the messenger of the mythical gods._


16


Venus was the mythical goddess of love She was very
beautiful


If Venus wanted someone to fall in love, she could
send her son Cupid on a mission Cupid would shoot the
person with one of his magic arrows The person would
then fall in love with the first person he or she saw


The myth of Cupid still provides entertainment today
You will see little Cupids all over the place on Valentine’s
Day, when we celebrate love


_Venus was the mythical goddess of love. She was also Cupid’s mother._


17


Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune are the
names of planets in our solar system These planets are
named after the mythical Roman gods For example, the
planet Mars is named after Mars, the mythical Roman
god of war


_The planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune_
_are named after the mythical Roman gods and goddesses._


18


Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods He melted
iron and other metals Then, he shaped the metal to
make a sword, a helmet, or a shield


Vulcan was the mythical god of fire and volcanoes


_Apollo, the mythical god of the sun (right), talking to_
_Vulcan, the mythical god of fire (left)_



19


Apollo was the mythical god of the sun He was also
the god of music and poetry


The Greeks and Romans both believed in the mythical
god Apollo He had a famous shrine at Delphi, in Greece
When the Greeks and Romans wanted advice, they would
send **messengers** to Delphi The priestess of Apollo
would give them an answer It was almost never a clear
answer, though Often, it was more like a riddle that they
had to figure out on their own


20


Minerva was the mythical goddess of **wisdom** She
was also the goddess of crafts and weaving


According to legend, Minerva was not born in the
usual way One day, Jupiter complained of a headache
Then—presto!—Minerva sprang, fully grown, from
his head


Minerva’s special animal was the owl Sometimes she
was painted with an owl perched on her shoulder


_Minerva springing forth from Jupiter’s head_



21


Diana was the mythical goddess of the moon She
was also the goddess of the hunt In statues, she is
often shown as a young girl, with a bow and arrow
Sometimes, the sculptor will also show one of her dogs
or a deer


_Diana was the mythical goddess of the moon and the hunt._


22


Bacchus was the Roman mythical god of grapes He
was followed by women and satyrs, who were half man
and half goat


A famous story tells how pirates tried to kidnap
Bacchus That was a big mistake The mythical god
transformed himself into a lion He turned the boat into
a lush garden As for the pirates, he changed them into
dolphins and sent them splashing away in the ocean


_Bacchus, the mythical Roman god of grapes_

**Report**



Imagine you are a solider in the Roman army
Your army is called the Roman Legion, and you are a
legionary You are wearing heavy, thick armor and a
helmet with flaps to protect your head and face during
fights If you are one of Rome’s finest soldiers, you are
wearing a helmet with a furry strip on top Besides your
armor, you have a shield, a spear, and a short sword

You have learned to march in
perfect step with hundreds of
other legionaries You have
faced many enemies in battle,
and you are prepared to fight
for Rome Since the founding
of the Roman Republic, you
and other legionaries have
proudly fought to expand
Rome’s power and **influence**


_Legionary_
24


_Roman territory and Carthaginian territory_


Rome is no longer just a city Through the years it
has expanded to include the majority of the area known
as present-day Italy Dozens of kingdoms and other areas
have been absorbed by the Roman Republic Some have
resisted and fought Rome’s growing power, only to fall
before the mighty Roman legions Other kings have
accepted Roman rule and have become wealthy patrician
citizens


Now you are preparing to fight a new enemy
This enemy comes from across the **Mediterranean**
They are called the Carthaginians, and their goal is to
destroy Rome itself! The Carthaginians, or the people
of Carthage, are from North Africa There, they have
built a **vast civilization**, even larger and richer than the
Roman Republic



25


_City of Carthage_


Carthage is the trading center of the known world
By land and by sea, most traded goods from the **exotic**,
or unfamiliar, lands to the East—Mesopotamia, Persia,
India—pass through Carthaginian territory on their
way to Rome or wherever else they may be headed
Perhaps a **conflict** between the powers of Rome and
Carthage is unavoidable Two growing **civilizations** may
only share the same sea and land for so long As Rome
has expanded through Italy, Carthage has expanded
throughout North Africa and across the sea to presentday Spain This rivalry between these two expanding
**civilizations** has led to several battles which have
become known as the Punic Wars


26


Imagine you and your legion are preparing for a
battle with the Carthaginians You are practicing a
formation called the _testudo_ [tess- _too_ -doh], or turtle
You and your fellow legionaries gather closely and lock
your shields together Hopefully, this will give you some
protection from the hundreds of Carthaginian arrows
that are sure to come your way in battle


You have not had much time to prepare Two days
ago, you and your legion were preparing to be shipped
off to fight on the island of Sicily, just off the shores of
Italy, which the Carthaginians are trying to claim as their
own Then, out of nowhere, your general announced
that a mighty army was invading Rome from the north,
something you and your fellow soldiers believed to be
impossible!


_Roman soldiers training in fighting formation (testudo)_


27


This mighty invading army of soldiers from Carthage
is led by a general named Hannibal Hannibal and his
troops are coming from Spain In order to **invade** Italy
from the north, Hannibal and his army would need
to cross the Alps These mountains stretch throughout
northern Italy, and you and the other Romans have
always felt safe believing that no invading army could
possibly cross these **peaks** You and your fellow soldiers
were wrong, and now you and the Roman Legion must
prepare to defend your homeland


It is not going to be easy You believe you are a better
soldier than any Carthaginian, but you don’t really know
because you have never faced one in battle You have no
idea what this army from Carthage will look like, but
you know they must be strong if they were able to climb


_Italian Alps_


28


_Hannibal with elephants_


those mountains You have heard rumors that, aside
from many thousands of soldiers, the Carthaginians are
bringing some kind of terrible monsters to the fight!


Okay, let’s take a break now from pretending to be a
Roman legionary Hannibal, the Carthaginian general,
really did cross the frozen Italian Alps with a huge army
And he really did bring monsters! Well, the Romans
thought they were monsters, but do you see what they
actually were? Elephants! The Romans had never seen
elephants before Elephants are not only very big and
very strong—they are also very smart The Carthaginians
used that size, strength, and intelligence to their
advantage in war


29


One of the reasons the Romans had been able to
expand so quickly through Italy and beyond was because
they were excellent fighters Roman soldiers were highly
**disciplined**, meaning that they obeyed orders and were
more determined to win for Rome than to survive The
main part of the Roman army consisted of heavily-armored
soldiers They were the foot soldiers, or infantry The
infantry was supported by cavalry, soldiers on horseback
like the ones in this image They marched shoulder-to­
shoulder toward the enemy and won because they stayed
together instead of panicking and running away


_Roman army units, infantry supported by cavalry bracing_
_for attack_


30


_Romans losing to elephants_


At least, they didn’t usually run away scared,
but that’s exactly what they did the first time they
encountered Hannibal and his war elephants! The
Roman legions were terrified by the elephants, in
addition to the thousands of soldiers Hannibal had
marched through the mountains The Roman cavalry
was no match for Hannibal’s elephants, which stomped
and trampled everything in sight In fact, the horses were
too smart to even try to attack the elephants, no matter
what the soldiers did!


31


_Hannibal frustrated with failed attacks, hearing news that some_
_Romans are going to Carthage_


At first, it seemed as though Hannibal would have
no problem marching his army and elephants all the
way to Rome Unfortunately for Hannibal, the Romans
were clever Instead of trying to **defeat** Hannibal’s army
in an open battle all at once, the Romans **harassed**,
or repeatedly attacked, them in small groups, escaping
before the rest of the Carthaginians knew what was
happening


Hannibal had hoped to crush the Roman army in an
attack on northern Rome in one easy battle, but instead
he found himself roaming around the Italian countryside
trying to find enough food to feed thousands of hungry
soldiers and a couple dozen elephants Believe it or not,
this went on for nearly sixteen years! Toward the end of


32


this war, the Romans put together another army and set
sail for Carthage to fight the Third Punic War When
Hannibal heard the news that some of the Romans
were headed to Carthage, he was forced to hurry home
Instead of destroying Rome, he ended up racing home to
try to defend Carthage from the Romans


During these three Punic Wars, which lasted more
than one hundred years, Rome and Carthage fought
for ultimate control of the **Mediterranean** Sea and all
the land surrounding it The Punic Wars did not turn
out well for the Carthaginians Eventually, the Romans
sacked Carthage, meaning they took everything of
value and destroyed the rest They also took many
Carthaginians as slaves As a result of winning the Punic
Wars, Rome gained control of nearly every bit of land
around the **Mediterranean** This was the beginning of
one of the most powerful **empires** in all of history

**Chapter**
###### **Hannibal** **Crosses the Alps**
# **4**



**Timetable’s**

**Report**



The Romans faced many enemies, but the strongest
and most determined enemy they ever faced was an
African general named Hannibal


Hannibal came from Carthage, a city on the coast
of Africa Carthage was home to many merchants and
traders Carthage also had an army and a navy The
Carthaginians took over much of North Africa and
Spain They even took over islands off the coast of Italy


The Romans saw Carthage as a **rival** They fought
three wars against Carthage These wars are known as the
Punic Wars and are thought to have been fought during
the years 264–146 BC


34


_Map of Roman and Carthaginian territories_



35


Hannibal’s father fought against Rome in the First
Punic War, 264–241 BC He made his son swear he
would carry on the fight against Rome Hannibal swore
he would and kept his promise It was Hannibal who
led the fight against Rome in the Second Punic War,
218–201 BC


Hannibal gathered an army in Spain He had tens
of thousands of foot soldiers He had thousands more
who fought on horseback Best of all, he had his special
forces: a squad of elephants Hannibal had learned that
few men are brave enough to stand and fight when they
see a thundering herd of elephants coming their way


Hannibal wanted to attack Rome However, to
**invade** Italy, he would have to march his army over
a range of mountains called the Alps The Alps were
tall The **peaks** were covered with snow and ice There
were no big roads that led across There were only a few
slippery paths


36


_Hannibal gathering his army to cross over the Alps_



37


Most men would not have tried to cross the
mountains, but Hannibal was not like most men He
marched his army over the mountains His men suffered
terribly They experienced rock slides, avalanches, and
freezing temperatures Many of the elephants did not
make it across In the end, though, Hannibal got his army
across the mountains and into Italy


In Italy, Hannibal went on the attack He beat the
Romans at Trebbia [TREB-bee-ə] in 218 BC Then,
he wiped out an entire Roman army at the Battle of
Trasimene [TRAZ-i-meen] in 217 BC The Romans lost
15,000 men The Battle of Cannae [CAN-ie] was even
worse The Romans lost at least 50,000 men, including
80 of their 300 senators


38


_Hannibal and his troops won several battles against_
_the Romans._



39


People thought that might be the beginning of the
end for Rome They did not see how the Romans could
go on But the Romans did go on They raised another
army and sent it out to stop Hannibal This time, the
Romans avoided big battles Instead, they fought a lot
of little battles They attacked Hannibal’s army here
and there They blocked his troops and slowed down
his marches They also launched a **counter-attack**
A Roman general named Scipio [SKIP-ee-oe] took
Roman troops to Africa The leaders of Carthage wrote
to Hannibal They told him to come home and protect
Carthage


Hannibal did as he was told He left Italy and
returned to Carthage At the Battle of Zama, he
**confronted** Scipio This time, the Romans were
**victorious** Hannibal won most of the battles in the
Second Punic War but he lost the war


After the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, Carthage was
never quite the same They fought another war against
Rome—the Third Punic War in the years 149–146
BC—but it was clear that Carthage was sinking, and
Rome was on the rise

_Hannibal surrendered to Scipio in Zama._

**Readmuch’s**

**Report**



With Carthage **conquered** and the Punic Wars
finished, there was nothing to stop the spread of Roman
power Rome became the heart of the **Mediterranean**
world The Romans realized that they no longer needed
to worry about growing and producing all their own
food Instead, they could **import** wheat, olives, and
other basic foods from other countries Then, Roman
farmers could focus on raising only the crops they
wanted


Ancient Rome became a major center of trade
Goods from all over the known world flowed through
its Roman ports, and in the process, Rome became rich
beyond compare The city grew at a rapid rate It must
have been astonishing to be there and to witness all the
workers who were involved in building the Colosseum,
the Forum, the temples, and all the other buildings you
see in this picture


42


Someone built this model
out of clay, and some of the
buildings are probably about
as big as a pencil eraser This
model is based on what we
estimate Rome would have _Model of Rome_
looked like two thousand years
ago, based on old Roman maps, drawings, and writings, as
well as the hard work of archaeologists in discovering these
items To the right of the center of the image, you can see
the Colosseum The long, oval structure in lower left of the
image is called the Circus Maximus This model gives you a
good idea of some of the places a Roman child might have
seen as he or she explored the city


So, what would it have been like to be born and
raised in the city of Rome?
Depending on who you
were, you might live
very different lives Let’s
imagine that you are a
child in a plebeian family
Plebeian families were a
class of common people
who were not as wealthy as
the upper classes You live

_Roman family in their apartment_


43


with your mother, father, sister, and brother in a small
apartment near the center of the city, not far from the
great Colosseum Your apartment building is crowded and
noisy In your plebeian family’s apartment, there is smoke
from ovens and open fires in the courtyards where women
bake and cook They are not allowed to cook in their
apartments for fear of burning down the whole building


On warm summer mornings, you and your friends
like to go to the bridge across the Tiber River and wave to
your father and the other merchants as they return from
the docks on their way back into the city Your father
dreams of becoming a wealthy merchant one day, but
right now he only owns one little boat Each morning, he
and his partners row out to the docks, where the big ships
unload their exotic goods Your father buys goods from

_Children watching their father captain his boat up the Tiber_


44


the merchants on the ships
and then he resells the goods
in other places in the city


After the boats pass,
you and your friends hurry
home for your daily lessons
Like most other plebeian
children, you are educated
at home instead of going

_Roman children at their lessons_

to school You are taught
to read and write in Latin You
are taught good manners and
proper behavior You learn about
Roman gods, Rome’s history,
and what it means to be a
proud Roman citizen You also
learn about your culture: the
traditional songs, dances, and
recipes


You like learning about
Roman history and poetry,
especially the work of a poet
named Virgil You heard a poem
by Virgil one time, and this line
_**Mosaic**_ _of Virgil_


45


stuck in your head: “Fortune **favors** the brave ” This line
is very important for Romans It means that you need to
be brave—willing to take risks and try new things—if
you want to have good fortune, or luck You know from
the stories your mother and father have told you that
Rome became successful because of many brave Roman
citizens who came before you


Now, let’s imagine that you are a child in a patrician
family Patricians were very wealthy Romans Like most
patrician families, you live in a large house known in
Latin as a domus [/doh*moos/] The domus has several
stories with enough rooms for your large household:
mother, father, children, grandparents, and several aunts,
uncles, and cousins It is common to find the family
gathered in the atrium, a large open space in the middle


46 _Patrician family in atrium_


of the domus An atrium features a skylight, or hole in
the roof, which creates a bright atmosphere and helps
air circulate through the house If you look closely at the
floor, you can see a shallow pool of water in the middle of
the atrium This pool is there to collect rainwater because
there is no way to close the skylight


Although plebeian families had opportunities to make
money and own property, life was not easy Because Rome
relied so much on grain shipments being imported from
across the sea, sometimes there was a food **shortage** War
and bad weather sometimes delayed those food shipments
from arriving at the wharves, and Rome would suddenly
become an angry city of thousands of hungry people
Disease was a big problem, too Romans worked hard to
try to keep the city clean, but it was impossible with so
many people


The patricians controlled the majority of the trade,
money, and government in Rome There were not as
many patricians as there were plebeians As time passed,
the ordinary people of Rome began to understand that
they had power in their numbers People were most
often upset when there were food shortages This always
made the patricians very nervous due to large groups of
plebeians coming together to voice their concerns These
times could be chaotic for everyone involved


47


_Romans waiting for grain ships_

The wealthy Romans
came up with a plan that
is sometimes called “bread
and circuses ” They wanted
to distract people from their
problems by staging amazing
spectacles This was part of
the reason why buildings like
the Circus Maximus and the
Colosseum were built Just
when the mobs were starting
to get restless and wanting
to start a riot, the Senate and
other patricians would pay
for a couple weeks of games
_Worried patrician watching_
to distract unhappy citizens
_an angry mob_


48


Usually these games involved
**chariot** races and circus
tricks involving trained
animals, acrobats, jugglers,
and other entertainers If
you have ever been to a
circus under a “big top” tent,
you can thank the Romans,
because they were one of the first to do it


When you walk through the city, you can hear the
cheers of the crowd in the Colosseum echoing through the
city whenever events are happening The Colosseum is a
huge amphitheater that seats 50,000 people Not too long
ago, your father took you to see your first chariot


_The ruins of the Colosseum as it appears today. In ancient times,_
_the Romans came to the Colosseum to see battles between people_
_and animals._


race at the Circus Maximus


The Circus Maximus is a great big racetrack in the
middle of the city When you see the chariots **sauntering**
down the city street, you don’t think anything of it—
they’re just men standing on two-wheeled wagons being
pulled by horses at a slow and relaxing pace But these
chariots seem completely different when you see them
racing around the track at the Circus Maximus Chariots
pulled by horses can move extremely fast! The driver,
called a charioteer, stands on a wheeled platform and
clings to the reins, hoping that he can keep control As
the charioteers quickly round the curves in the racetrack,
everyone holds their breath to see if they can remain
upright


The city is full of
opportunities for acquiring
wealth, new knowledge,
and new experiences Even
though you were born and
raised in the vibrant city of
Rome, you are still amazed _Charioteers racing in the Circus_

to help the water flow through them The water comes
from mountains, and because the water is higher than the
city, the water flows downhill through the channels of the
**aqueducts** with the help of gravity


The **aqueduct** is just one of many **ingenious**
accomplishments—in addition to road networks, sewer
and heating systems, and beautiful structures such as the
Colosseum and Pantheon—that surround Rome and make

Have you ever wished you were a king? Does that
seem like the best job a person could have? Well, before
you decide for sure, listen to this legend that was made
famous by the Roman writer Cicero [SIS-er-oe] more
than two thousand years ago

Damocles [DA-mə-kleez] was a friend of Dionysius

[die-ə-NIS-ee-us], the king of Syracuse, a city in
southern Italy Damocles **envied** his friend He believed
that the king had a very good life He had all the riches
and power he could want What could be better?


“You think I’m lucky?” Dionysius said to him one
day “If you think so, let’s trade places You sit here, on
the throne Try it for just one day Then, tell me if you
still think I’m lucky”


Damocles accepted his friend’s invitation He was
**eager** to live the life of a king

When the day came, Damocles ordered servants
to bring him fine robes He had them set out a great
**banquet** He ordered expensive food and fine music He
sat back, sure that he was the happiest man in the world


Then, he looked up He caught his breath in fear
Above his head was a sword It was **dangling** from the
ceiling, held by a single strand of horse’s hair Damocles
could not speak He could not eat He could not enjoy
the music He could not even move


“What is the matter, my friend?” asked Dionysius


“How can I **conduct** my life with that sword hanging
above me?” Damocles asked


“How indeed?” answered Dionysius “Now you
know how it feels to be king That sword hangs over
my head every minute of every day There is always the
chance the thread will break An **advisor** may turn on
me An enemy spy may attack me I might make an
unwise decision that brings my **downfall** You see, my
friend, with power comes danger ”

**Report**



After the Punic Wars, generals started to play a big
part in Roman history Roman generals went all around
the **Mediterranean**, fighting battles and **conquering**
new lands Some of these generals became heroes
Some of them got to be so famous and so popular that
they **threatened** to take over the republic That’s what
happened with Julius Caesar


Julius Caesar came from an old Roman family
He was proud and ambitious, with a high opinion of
himself


When he was a young man, Caesar was captured by
pirates The pirates told him they would kill him unless
he could pay a **ransom** of twenty **talents** Caesar laughed
at them He told them they clearly didn’t know what
sort of man they had captured He was Julius Caesar He
was not a man to be **ransomed** for just twenty **talents** !
Caesar told the pirates he would not allow himself to be
**ransomed** for less than fifty **talents** !


57


_Caesar told the pirates he was worth a larger_ _**ransom**_ _._


58


Caesar told his friends to raise the money He stayed
with the pirates, writing poems He read some of his
poems to the pirates They shrugged They didn’t care
much for poetry They were pirates, not poets They just
wanted to collect the **ransom** money Caesar got angry
at the pirates He scolded them for not liking his poems
He told them they had no taste He told them they were
**barbarians** He told them someday he would come back
and punish them for their bad taste The pirates thought
Caesar was joking Maybe they thought he was crazy At
any rate, as soon as they got the **ransom** money, they
quickly forgot about him But Caesar did not forget
about them He went back to Rome, got some ships, and
hired some good fighters Then, he tracked down the
pirates and punished them


Caesar quickly established himself as a man who
knew what to do with his sword and also with his pen
Once, he was sent to Asia The people there were in
**revolt** Caesar led a Roman army there and put down the
**revolt** Then, he got out his pen to write his report The
normal thing would have been to write a long report,
filling several pages, but that was not Caesar’s style


59


_Caesar quickly became known as a brave and determined soldier._


60


This is the report Caesar sent back to Rome:


Veni, vidi, vici [wae-NEE, wee-DEE, wee-KEE]


That’s the whole report Those three words—
written in **Latin**, the language of ancient Rome—
mean, “I came, I saw, I **conquered** ” What else was
there to say? Mission accomplished!


Caesar led an army into the land the Romans called
Gaul Today, we call it France Gaul was not part of
the Roman **civilization** when Caesar marched in, but
it was when he marched out a few years later Caesar
**conquered** it Then, he wrote a book about how he did
it The first sentence in his book is famous


It is written in **Latin** In English, the words mean,
“The whole of Gaul is divided into three parts ”


If you ever study **Latin**, you may have a chance to
read Caesar’s book on the Gallic Wars It’s so clear and so
well-written that teachers all around the world still use it
to teach **Latin** to students

## **8**

**Teachwell’s**

**Report**



You will hear the name Julius
Caesar, or just Caesar, throughout your
life You may have already heard this
name many times Julius Caesar is one

_Statue of Julius_ of the most famous Romans who ever
_Caesar_

lived His full name was Gaius [ _guy_ -es]
Julius Caesar, and he was born in 100 BC, when the
Roman Republic was a little more than 400 years old



Julius Caesar became a soldier at a young age
Originally, he was nominated to become a priest of
Jupiter, which was a very powerful religious position
in Rome However, a **feud** erupted
between his family and another
important patrician family As a result,
Julius Caesar left Rome and joined the
army instead

_Young Julius Caesar_
_as a soldier_



63


Julius Caesar was a fine
soldier, and he soon became
well known throughout the
army For his bravery, he was
awarded a Civic Crown, which
was a simple crown made of
oak leaves A Civic Crown was
a very important honor and
represented a soldier’s bravery
Only very important Romans
earned the right to wear one



_Young Julius Caesar wearing_
_the Civic Crown_



After a few years in the
army, Julius Caesar returned to Rome and became
involved in politics The word _politics_ refers to the
activities involved in running a government In a
republic, making laws, going to war, collecting taxes, and
other government actions all require agreement between
various people in the government In Rome, the consuls,
senators, and other Roman officials all had to work
together to try to solve problems



However, when it came to governing the areas Rome
controlled, there were always disagreements about
what the role of government should be In order to get
things done, politicians formed an **alliance** with other
politicians who agreed with them


64


_Young Julius Caesar in politics_

In Roman politics, there was power in numbers If a
group of politicians formed an **alliance**, then together
they had an easier time convincing other people to go
along with them


Julius Caesar formed a political **alliance** with another
soldier, a very rich man named Pompey [ _pom_ -pee]
Together, they set out to gain the things they wanted,
such as land and power Julius Caesar was elected to a
number of special political offices, even though he had
as many enemies as he had friends He worked his way
up the political ladder until he finally became one of the
two consuls at the top of the government


65


Remember, the consuls had a great deal of power To
keep some of that power under control, the two consuls
worked together with a process of checks and balances:
They could not take any action until both consuls
agreed If one consul wanted a new law to be passed,
and the other consul did not like the law, then the two
of them would have to **negotiate** and **compromise** and
make whatever changes were necessary in order to come
to an agreement


Consuls served for just one year After that, they
often became proconsuls Proconsuls were often
governors of provinces, the lands beyond Italy that the


_Consuls_


Roman army had **conquered** The red areas on this map
show Roman territory around the time of Julius Caesar’s
birth in 100 BC, shortly after the end of the Punic Wars
You can see that after the Punic Wars, Rome controlled
most of the land around the **Mediterranean** Sea


After his term as consul, Julius Caesar became
proconsul of a number of provinces to the north and east
of Italy Julius Caesar was in charge of Rome’s northern
frontier As proconsul, he had a number of Roman
legions at his command, and decided that his job was
to use his armies to expand Roman territory farther to


_Map of Roman expansion during Caesar’s rule_


67


the north In these northern provinces, the Romans
built roads, towns, and temples One of Caesar’s jobs as
proconsul was to protect Roman property in these areas
Julius Caesar decided it would be a good idea if he went
out and **conquered** these lands for Rome


The only problem was that the areas he wanted to
**conquer** were full of what were considered by some as
**barbarians** That is what many Romans called some
of the people who didn’t speak their language and who
had a different culture than theirs The Romans did not
consider these people to be an advanced society because
they did not have roads, **aqueducts**, massive marble
**arenas**, or temples The Romans considered these people
to be uncultured To someone accustomed to the sights

_Proconsul Julius Caesar looking over northern territory making_
_plans, map of areas visible_


and sounds of the vibrant city of Rome and all that
Roman **civilization** had to offer, the homes and lifestyles
of those outside of Rome may have seemed **crude**, or
unpolished To the common Roman mind, they would
be doing these “ **barbarians** ” a **favor** by **conquering** them
and forcing them to adopt Roman ways and culture


The people to the north of Rome that the Romans
considered **barbarians** could basically be put into
two categories: the Gauls and the Germanic tribes
The Gauls lived in the area of present-day France, and
the Germanic tribes were spread across a large area of
central and northern Europe Julius Caesar first turned
his attention to the Gauls He spent much of the next
ten years fighting to **conquer** and control Gaul, but it
seemed there was always another Gallic or Germanic
tribe ready to rise up and fight Roman expansion

There were many
Gallic tribes, each
following its own
king, or chieftain,
and its own set of
laws and customs


_Gauls_


69


_Caesar writing his memoirs of Gallic victories_

The Gauls’ way of life was more sophisticated than the
Romans expected The Gallic tribes often traded and
cooperated with each other; they had their own money,
their own religion, and their own traditional stories,
songs, and dances

At the time when Julius Caesar was given the
province of Gaul as a proconsul, he needed money to
make things happen and to become further recognized
He also needed to show that he was not someone to
be pushed around by his enemies He looked at Gaul
as a wonderful opportunity—a massive area of land
and people to **conquer** ! He hoped that because they all
answered to their own chieftains, the Gauls would be
easy to divide and **conquer**

**Report**



As you heard in the previous Read-Aloud, Gallic
soldiers were not able to put up much of a fight in some
areas, and so Julius Caesar thought he was going to be
able to **conquer** Gaul quite easily The Romans thought
the people in Gaul were **uncivilized**, and they wanted
to **conquer** them so they would adopt Roman ways and
culture But the Gauls, led by a powerful Gallic chieftain
named Vercingetorix [ver-sin- _gett_ -oh-ricks], rose up
and rebelled against him Vercingetorix united several
powerful Gallic tribes, and for a few months it appeared
as though the Gauls might be able to succeed against this
Roman **conqueror**


_Vercingetorix leading_
_the rebellion against_

_Roman military technology_


Unfortunately for the Gauls, Julius Caesar and
his legions would not be easy to **defeat** Caesar’s men
would follow him anywhere Julius Caesar was loved
by soldiers because he **favored** being out in front of his
army, fighting alongside the common soldiers His men
respected him for it, even though it may have terrified
them to see their leader so close to danger


Aside from being courageous, Julius Caesar was
a brilliant commander He kept up with the latest in
Roman technology, and his armies fielded weapons that
the Gauls had never imagined Julius Caesar **favored**
the ballista in battle, which was like a giant catapult
or crossbow used to throw weapons The Gauls were
terrified when they faced the ballista on the battlefield


72


Julius Caesar put all his technology to use during one
particular **siege**, the battle in which he finally **defeated**
Vercingetorix A **siege** is a long, drawn-out battle in
which one army has retreated behind the **fortress** walls
of its city, and the other army surrounds the fortress and
tries to break in A **siege** could take months or even years
to **resolve** If the one army could not break down the
city walls or climb over them, then they would wait until
the defenders in the city ran out of food or water


Thanks to the ballista and other weapons used in
battle, Julius Caesar was able to force the Gallic chieftain
Vercingetorix to surrender Vercingetorix spent several
years in jail, and was killed when Caesar finally returned
to Rome


_Statue of Vercingetorix_


_Caesar’s triumphant procession into Rome_


When he returned to Rome, Julius Caesar threw
a military parade for himself called a triumph In this
parade, Gallic warriors were in chains Commander
Julius Caesar and his soldiers marched around Rome,
showing off prizes and basking in cheers and applause
from the citizens of Rome While Julius Caesar had
many admirers, he still had many enemies To his
enemies’ horror, Julius Caesar had returned to Rome
more powerful than ever!


74


_Caesar at_
_the Rubicon_


Before marching his army into Rome, Julius Caesar
had led his legions across the Rubicon River in northern
Italy and then south into the city of Rome Marching
an army into Rome was against an old Roman law By
crossing the Rubicon River, Caesar was perceived as a
**threat** who might try to take over the government Julius
Caesar knew that what he had done would start a **civil**
**war** This meant that Romans were going to fight against
each other When Caesar crossed the Rubicon River,
Caesar said, “The die is cast,” meaning that he knew
exactly what would happen if he crossed the Rubicon,

**favor** his bravery



Caesar’s old ally Pompey was now
his greatest enemy Pompey did not
like all the power and glory Caesar had

several years Through it all, Julius Caesar remained
a hero to most plebeians During his time in Roman
politics, Caesar preferred passing laws that **favored** the
lowly over the rich in Roman society and members of
the Senate In the end, Caesar’s army won the **civil war**
Caesar unexpectedly had mercy on many of his other
enemies within Rome Rather than remove all of his
enemies, as most ancient Roman leaders would have
done, Caesar tried to heal the wounds of **civil war** by
trying to unite Romans


Caesar was now the **dictator** of Rome, meaning
he was the main ruler who could make decisions
without needing the approval of consuls This was
very different from the process of checks and balances
which the Romans had relied upon to control the
power of the consuls! Julius Caesar and his armies
continued to **conquer** other lands, extending Rome’s
**influence** throughout nearly all of the **Mediterranean**
After one battle, Caesar famously claimed, “ _Veni,_
_vidi, vici_,” [pronounced in Caesar’s day as _way_ -nee,
_wee_ -dee, _wee_ -kee] meaning in **Latin**, “I came, I saw,
I **conquered** ”


Julius Caesar wanted to **import** wheat, among
other things, from Egypt into Rome Thanks to the
lush farmland along the Nile, there was enough wheat


76


_Caesar in Egypt with Cleopatra_


in Egypt to feed all of Rome Julius Caesar crossed the
**Mediterranean** Sea to seize Egypt’s wealth Once there,
however, Caesar met Queen Cleopatra and instead, he fell
in love! Cleopatra was considered to be an extraordinary
person She was incredibly smart and clever When
Cleopatra walked into a room, everyone wanted to hear
what she had to say


Cleopatra was involved in her own political problems
and **civil war** in Egypt She was fighting her brother,
Ptolemy [ _tol_ -uh-mee], for control of the Egyptian
throne Caesar helped her settle her problem by having
Ptolemy killed After Ptolemy’s death, Cleopatra
became queen of Egypt, and much-needed shipments of
Egyptian wheat were soon exported to Rome


77


Eventually, Caesar’s enemies gained the upper hand
They worried that as Caesar became more powerful, he
might declare himself king Many members of the Senate
became jealous and wanted to remove Caesar from
power In one of history’s most famous deaths, Caesar
was killed on the floor of the Roman Senate It was the
Ides of March—March 15, 44 BC


Sixty Roman senators, led by Junius Brutus, secretly
**plotted** to murder Caesar in the Roman Senate
According to legend, Julius Caesar’s last words were “ _Et_
_tu, Brute_ ?” This means, “And you, Brutus?” Caesar was
surprised to discover that Brutus, someone he considered
an ally, was a part of the plan to murder him For all the
troubles he faced during his time as **dictator** of Rome,
Julius Caesar died a hero in the eyes of most Roman
people

After he **conquered** Gaul, Caesar started marching
back to Rome By this time, the Roman senators were
very nervous about Caesar They thought he might
march into Rome and take over The senators sent Caesar
a message They told him to stop and send his soldiers
home They ordered him not to cross the Rubicon River
If he did, they said he would not be treated as a hero
Instead, he would be treated as a **traitor** and an **invader**


In the year 49 **BC**, Caesar crossed the Rubicon
He is said to have remarked in **Latin**, “The die is cast ”
That was his way of saying he knew he was taking a
big risk Crossing the Rubicon meant there was no
turning back


79

Caesar’s actions led to a **civil war** —a war in which
Romans fought against Romans Caesar was the leader
on one side Pompey [POM-pee], another famous
Roman general, was the leader on the other side
Caesar **defeated** Pompey and chased him to Egypt,
where Pompey was killed


When Caesar got to Egypt, he found another country
tangled up in a **civil war** The princess Cleopatra was
trying to take power from her brother Caesar sided with
Cleopatra He helped her become Queen of Egypt


Caesar had big plans He didn’t think Rome was
run the way it should be He wanted to change a lot of
things He had the Senate pass new laws He replaced
the old calendar with the one we still use today (Did you
know that the month of July is named for Julius Caesar?)


81


_Caesar met Cleopatra in Egypt and helped her become queen._


82


Caesar wanted to do more, but he felt he needed
more power He got himself appointed **dictator** At first,
he was appointed **dictator** for only one year That was
not so **unusual** The Romans had chosen **dictators** in
the past A **dictator** could be put in power during times
of trouble But the **dictator** was only supposed to rule
for a little while, until the troubles passed That was not
what Caesar had in mind He had himself appointed
**dictator** for ten years That upset a lot of people How
do you think those people felt a little later, when Caesar
had himself appointed **dictator** for life? That was really
too much for some people For hundreds of years, Rome
had been a republic Now, Caesar was setting himself up
as a **dictator** Perhaps, he even wanted to be a king That
was even more upsetting The Romans had driven out
the kings hundreds of years earlier


83


_Caesar became_ _**dictator**_ _of Rome for life._


84


A group of Romans agreed that Caesar was a **threat**
to the republic They stabbed him to death in the Senate


Some of the men who stabbed Julius Caesar were
men he considered friends One of them, Brutus, was a
man Caesar had treated almost like a son How could
these men kill Caesar? Brutus explained that it was not
that he loved Caesar less, but that he loved Rome—
and the Roman republic—more Brutus and the other
**conspirators** killed Caesar to save Rome At least, that
was the plan

**Read-Aloud**

During his life, Julius Caesar had a few close friends,
the closest of which was Marc Antony Marc Antony
was a general under Julius Caesar and helped in the
**conquering** of Gaul Julius Caesar did not have any sons
that could take over his position as ruler of Rome In his
will, Julius Caesar adopted his eighteen-year-old greatnephew, Octavian, as his own son After Caesar’s death,
Marc Antony and Octavian worked together to fight
against Julius Caesar’s enemies and **resolve** some of the
**conflict** in the **empire**, at least for a while



_Marc Antony and_

Marc Antony took it upon
himself to make sure Rome and
Egypt continued to be allies,
because Rome needed to keep
importing Egypt’s wheat Plus,
Cleopatra’s Egypt was a rich and
powerful country with a strong

_Cleopatra with Marc Antony_


army—not as powerful as Rome, but still an important
force in the **Mediterranean** area with which to have an
**alliance** Just as Julius Caesar had done, Marc Antony
fell in love with Cleopatra, and she fell in love with him
In fact, they became one of the most famous couples in
history William Shakespeare, the playwright you heard
about earlier who wrote the play _Julius Caesar_, wrote a
play about this couple titled _Antony and Cleopatra_


Marc Antony and Cleopatra became allies in
a struggle for power with Octavian Even though
Marc Antony and Octavian had worked together in
an **alliance** to end Rome’s **civil war**, they eventually
became enemies


88


Octavian won the war against Marc Antony and
Cleopatra He went on to become the most powerful
Roman leader at the time, with **influence** over most of
the senators and generals Octavian served as consul,
proconsul, and in a number of other important
roles, becoming a true Roman war hero just like his
**predecessor**, Julius Caesar Octavian managed to make
more friends than enemies, unlike Julius Caesar He was
so popular and powerful that the Senate gave him a new
name: Augustus, which in **Latin** means “ **Illustrious**
One ” Augustus Caesar was presented the same award as
his **predecessor** for his bravery, the Civic Crown Today,
Augustus is remembered as **Emperor** Augustus Caesar
He took the name _Caesar_ in honor of Julius Caesar, his
**predecessor** and adoptive father


_Octavian as_ _**emperor**_



89


Augustus Caesar was considered the first Roman
**Emperor**, which means he had a lot of power and
**influence** over Roman politics Under his leadership,
Rome was no longer called the Roman Republic
Instead, from the time of **Emperor** Augustus Caesar
onward, it would be called the Roman **Empire**


Whether he was called a consul, **dictator**, king, or
**emperor** did not matter; the fact was that Augustus
Caesar was the most powerful man in Rome Many
soldiers and generals throughout most of Rome’s
provinces were loyal to Augustus Caesar


_Diagram of power in Roman_ _**Empire**_


90


They respected him and would do anything for him
This alone gave Augustus Caesar great power He was
also incredibly rich, and he had the power to make
other people incredibly rich if they would do what he
wanted them to do Under the Roman **Empire**, the basic
structure of government was similar to the structure
of the Roman Republic: There was a Senate with two
consuls, as well as proconsuls, or governors, and many of
the same laws The **emperor** of the Roman **Empire** was
most powerful


During his first several years as **emperor**, Augustus
Caesar worked to make Rome’s borders and provinces
secure and safe from attack The Roman **Empire** was
huge, stretching over thousands of miles including large
cities, **vast** forests, mighty mountains, and **parched**
deserts The land of Gaul had been **conquered**, but there
were still tribes in the deep forests determined to fight
the Romans that called them **barbarians** To the north
of Gaul there were countless other Germanic tribes that
were angry and nervous that Rome would try to take
their land next In the Alps, just north of Italy, there
were still many ancient tribes unwilling to submit
to Roman rule There were also enemies in Spain and
throughout various parts of Africa and western Asia


91


Individually, none of these enemies were a real **threat**
to Roman power, but all together they posed a real
problem It seemed as though the wars and fighting
would never end


_Map of Roman border_ _**threats**_ _, the_ Pax Romana

Augustus Caesar wanted to put an end to the
continuous warfare once and for all He spent more
than twenty years fighting these enemies of Rome
and expanded Roman territory to reduce the amount
of surrounding **threats** Thus began an important
two- hundred-year period in Roman history known as
the _Pax Romana_, which means Roman Peace in **Latin**
In truth, things weren’t entirely peaceful; Roman armies


92


still had to do some fighting here and there, but there
were no serious **threats** to Roman power Augustus
Caesar preferred to win wars without fighting at all,
and many enemies surrendered to Roman rule rather
than face Roman legions in battle The mere thought of
fighting the Romans was enough to make most kings
shudder with fear


Wherever they **conquered**, the Romans built their
roads, bridges, temples, **aqueducts**, and fortresses
Wherever they went, the Romans also brought their
language, laws, money, and arts Augustus Caesar loved
art, and he knew how important it was to all Romans
He paid artists to create some of the finest and most
beautiful sculptures, **mosaics**, frescoes, and temples
There are fewer frescoes today because they have not
held up as well as **mosaics** and sculptures over time
Frescoes and other art from ancient Rome show us
that Romans were talented artists Ancient Roman art
provides important clues about daily Roman life



93


_Roman art (_ _**mosaics**_ _, fresco, sculpture)_

Augustus Caesar convinced Romans that peace was
better than war This idea was difficult for many Romans
to accept at first, because they were used to constant
warfare and expansion as the way to sustain the Roman
**Empire** Roman boys were expected to join the army
as adults, and when necessary, die in battle for Rome
Roman mothers, wives, and children expected their
sons, husbands, and fathers to march away to wars, often
never to return The idea of _Pax Romana_ was something
most Romans had never even dreamed of! Over the next
hundreds of years, the Roman **Empire** had many, many
**emperors**, but none would ever be as powerful or as
**illustrious** as Augustus Caesar

The men who killed Julius Caesar were trying to save
the republic They did not succeed After Caesar was
killed, another **civil war** broke out The man who came
out on top at the end of the war was a man known as
Augustus Caesar, or just Augustus


Augustus was an adopted son of Caesar and he
agreed with Caesar that Rome needed to change But he
was smart He knew that the Romans cared about their
history They would not be happy if he came to power
and changed everything all at once What he did instead
was very clever He made himself **emperor**, and he made
it clear that he intended to serve until he died That
meant Rome was no longer a republic But Augustus
did not sweep away all of the old **traditions** He let the
Romans keep the Senate and consuls Still, everybody
knew that it was Augustus who was really in charge


Augustus brought peace to a country that had been
fighting **civil wars** for many years


95


_A statue of Augustus Caesar_


He **reformed** the government and **conquered** new
lands He set up monuments He built **magnificent** new
buildings, including temples, theaters, and bath houses
He also repaired old buildings and decorated them with
fancy stone, like marble He once boasted that he “found
Rome brick and left it marble ”


96


One of the most famous buildings built during the
**reign** of Augustus is the Pantheon The Pantheon was built
as a temple to all the mythical Roman gods ( _Pan–_ means
all and _theo–_ means gods ) The Pantheon is a beautiful
building with a dome roof While the original building was
destroyed in a fire, the Pantheon still standing today was
built to replace it Thousands of tourists visit it every day


_The Pantheon as it appears in Rome today_


97


The Pantheon is only one of many examples of great
Roman architecture Another one is the Colosseum
The Colosseum, built not long after the **reign** of
Augustus, is a huge, oval stadium The Romans went
to the Colosseum to see people and animals fight The
Colosseum would hold fifty thousand people Today the
Colosseum is in ruins, but some of it is left to give us a
good idea of what it would have looked like


The Colosseum is not just an example of the great
architecture of the Romans, but also an example of
how the conquest of the Roman Empire made that
architecture possible Roman emperors had conquered
a land far to the east called Judea, home to the Jewish
people Rome took funds from the Jewish Temple in
Jerusalem and enslaved
thousands of Jewish
people Those funds and
those slaves largely built
the Colosseum

Roman architecture supported Roman entertainment
The Romans enjoyed watching **chariot** races These
were held in an even larger stadium, called the Circus
Maximus For the Romans, a **chariot** race or a fight was
good entertainment, the way a football game or a movie
is for us today

The Romans also built roads and **aqueducts**
The roads brought people from all around the **Empire**
The **aqueducts** were used to bring water from the

###### **Christianity** **and the Roman** **Empire**

**Report**



**Read-Aloud**

Over hundreds of years, the Roman Empire stretched
across many different lands and included many different
groups of people As the Romans conquered more land,
they tried to spread their culture and **customs** However,
the Romans themselves were also changed by the cultures
of the people they ruled One group of people in a farflung corner of the empire ended up having a major
impact on the Romans


_Map of the_
_Roman Empire_


101


Judea was a land
that sat at the far
eastern edge of the
Roman Empire,
and is in the general
area of some of the
modern-day country

_Judea, 1st century BC_ of Israel Judea was the

homeland of the Jewish
people Over more than a thousand years, Jews sometimes
ruled this land directly, but they had also been subject to
different conquering empires The Romans were another
in a long line of conquering powers


Jewish people practice a religion known as Judaism
Judaism is based around a series of religious texts called the
Tanakh, or the Hebrew Bible The Hebrew Bible stresses
belief in one God and describes that the proper way to
connect to God is through just and ethical action The
Jewish religious practice of worshiping a single God was
very different from the Roman practice of worshiping many
different gods


As is true with any religious texts, there have been
different interpretations of the Hebrew Bible Some
interpreted the texts that there would be a coming **Messiah**,
or an anointed or chosen one set apart for a special purpose


102


During the time of the Roman Empire, some in the Jewish
faith believed this Messiah would come to free the Jewish
people from Roman rule

The Romans could apply very strict rules to the people
they conquered, and that was no different for the Jews
of Judea under Roman rule Jews were still permitted
to practice their religious beliefs, but life was often very
hard for them Romans took Jews captive as slaves and
took money they had saved for religious purposes Jewish
leaders in Judea organized several rebellions to try to break
free of Roman rule The Jewish people from the small
region of Judea had an outsized impact on the empire


Two thousand years ago, when Augustus Caesar
ruled the Roman Empire,
a Jewish man who lived in
Judea would ultimately have
a very significant impact on
the history of the empire and
beyond His name was Jesus of
Nazareth The Roman historian
Josephus described some of
Jesus’s life and his death at the
hands of Roman authorities


_Jesus of Nazareth from_
_DaVinci’s The Last Supper_


103


Other texts were also written about Jesus after his death
and brought together as the New Testament They were
grouped with the texts of the Hebrew Bible, which were
organized as the Old Testament Together, they formed the
Christian Bible


These New Testament texts of the Christian Bible
describe what modern Christians believe to be the
circumstances surrounding the birth of Jesus, celebrated
today as Christmas According to the texts, a Jewish
woman named Mary was told by an angel that she had
found **favor** with God The angel explained that she would
have a son who would be called Jesus, and that this was the
Messiah referenced in the Hebrew Bible


_Map of Bethlehem_


104


According to the Christian Bible, on the day Jesus
was born, his mother Mary and father Joseph were
traveling to the town of Bethlehem to register for the
**census** The census, ordered by the Roman government,
required Roman citizens to be counted and their names
registered This was used in part to help the empire know
how many people needed to pay taxes and is a practice
continued by governments to this day

When Mary and Joseph arrived in Bethlehem, they
were told there were no rooms available to rent They
took shelter in a nearby **stable**, a type of barn where
animals are kept When Jesus was born, Mary wrapped
him in pieces of cloth and laid him in a **manger**, which
is a long wooden or stone box used for horses and cattle
to eat animal feed This story of Jesus’s birth in a stable
is commonly featured as part of displays put on by
Christians even today during the Christmas holidays
each year

The Christian Bible explains that throughout his
life, Jesus taught about God’s love and forgiveness, and
performed many miracles For many early Christians and
Christians today, accounts of miracles performed by Jesus
are an important part of their beliefs, and it encouraged
a rapid spreading of the faith Some of these miracles
included healing the sick, walking on water, and calming a
raging storm


105


The Christian Bible says that a growing number
of people became followers of Jesus But there were
also people who were angry that Jesus was spreading a
religious message that went against their beliefs Some
people in positions of power in that part of the Roman
Empire were upset that Jesus was worshiped by so many
They wanted Jesus gone They began thinking of ways to
stop people from following him

The Christian Bible explains that Jesus told his closest
**disciples**, or followers, that he would soon be killed, but that
he would rise from the dead three days later Not long after
that, Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities Pontius
Pilate, the Roman governor of the region, made the decision
to have Jesus sentenced to death by crucifixion

The Christian Bible explains
that Jesus rose from the dead Three
days after his death by the Roman
authorities, followers of Jesus visited
his tomb and found it empty An
angel appeared and said he has risen
and led them into the tomb When
the visitors entered the tomb, they
found it empty The Roman historian
Josephus noted that Jesus had many
_Roman official_ disciples at the time of his death


106


by Pilate: “But those who had become his disciples did
not abandon his discipleship They reported that he had
appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that
he was alive ” [1 ]

In the years that followed, many heard believers’
stories about the **resurrection** of Jesus, that he had risen
from the dead, and word spread throughout the empire
These early followers of Jesus grew to a large group of
believers They eventually became known as Christians,
calling Jesus “the Christ,” which was the Greek word
for Messiah, and worshiping Jesus as the Son of God
Over time, these early Christians developed many new
customs, including eventually celebrating the event of the
resurrection as Easter



Early Christians endured
**persecution** from the
Romans, meaning that they
were treated badly for their
beliefs Some Christians
were put in jail, some others
were exiled, or forced to
leave their homelands, and
some were put to death
Some were forced to fight

_A cross memorial in the Colosseum_


107


lions in the Colosseum During this
time, Christians had to meet in secret to
worship God

In spite of the persecution, for several
hundred years, more people throughout
the Roman empire began converting to
Christianity Eventually, this reached
the center of Roman power Constantine was emperor
of Rome between 306 AD and 337 AD, and was the
first Roman emperor to convert to the new religion
He legalized Christianity in Rome and began providing
formal government support for the religion

Throughout its history, Rome went through many
changes, but maybe none so great as the transformation
that followed the life of Jesus of Nazareth For nearly one
thousand years, the core of Roman religious life had been
to worship many different gods, continuing the beliefs
of the ancient Greeks Much of Roman culture was built
around those religious beliefs But those religious beliefs
were completely upended Rome would never be the same


108


Beyond Rome, the birth, death and resurrection
of Jesus are still recognized by billions of people all
around the world and celebrated during holidays such as
Christmas and Easter Christians honor his life every day
by showing faith and practicing the values of Christianity

**Chapter**
###### **The Road to** **Damascus**
### **14**


**Read-Aloud**



**Chatter’s**

**Report**



The Roman Empire was **renowned** for its architecture,
engineering, and technology Great buildings like the
Colosseum, construction of **aqueducts**, and even
certain building materials like concrete were incredible
developments that came from the Roman Empire Even
roads were a new technology in ancient Rome Before
Rome, in most places, traveling long distances was
extremely difficult Most people rarely traveled outside of
their home cities There were no well-built roads Instead,
there were only dirt trails used mostly for walking


When the Romans conquered a country, they built
roads The roads were built to be very strong, sometimes
including concrete They were much easier to travel
on than the previous dirt trails The roads were made
to connect to each other throughout the empire Since
they were all connected, it could be said that all roads
lead to Rome These roads allowed Romans to travel
great distances to trade goods, and it allowed the Roman
Empire to move their army when needed


_All roads lead to Rome_


111


Because the roads helped people to travel farther than
ever before, ideas could spread faster, too This included
the ideas of early Christians The primary idea spread by
those Christians was that Jesus died and was resurrected
in order to forgive people for their sins, or harmful
behaviors that separate a person from God Roman
religious beliefs focused on the idea that individuals must
worship many different gods, depending on what the
individuals needed at different points in their lives While
Christianity was spreading on the roads of the Roman
Empire, many people with different religious beliefs


_Roman roads_


112


disagreed with these Christian ideas and **persecuted**
early Christians


Several texts of the New Testament of the Christian
Bible were written about or by a man who came to be
known as Paul According to the Bible, Paul was a formal
citizen of Rome and traveled often on Roman roads


The Christian Bible explains that when he was a young
man, Paul believed that Christians should be **persecuted**
for their beliefs Paul traveled on Roman roads to find,
arrest, and punish Christians Many Christians feared him
Roman roads were a key tool to allow Paul and others like
him to impose Roman power and culture, as well as certain
religious beliefs, on people all over the Empire One day,
Paul was traveling on the road to Damascus Damascus was
a major city in that part of the Roman Empire, and it was,
and still is, the capital of Syria


According to the Christian Bible, Paul experienced a
vision from Jesus on the road to Damascus, was blinded,
and then was able to see again From that point forward,
the entire focus of his life became to spread the message
of Christianity

The Christian Bible describes Paul as a changed man,
traveling from city to city, along many different Roman
roads, and sometimes by boat He would meet with new


113


groups of people in towns far from where he began He
would travel to cities in the empire where the Romans
had constructed beautiful temples to various Roman gods,
but he would preach the messages of Christianity Many
people in the Empire ended up becoming a Christian as
a result Before his vision on the road to Damascus, he
would persecute Christians, but now, he traveled far and
wide and was himself persecuted, even spending time in
Roman jails because of his new religious beliefs He wrote
several letters detailing his experiences, many of which
became parts of the New Testament of the Christian
Bible But when he could, he continued to travel, even
making it to Rome All roads did indeed lead to Rome,
and it was along these roads that the ideas of Christianity
would travel and ultimately transform the empire

**Chapter**
###### **From Augustus** **to Constantine**
### **15**



**Chatter’s**

**Report**



For 500 years before Julius Caesar, the Roman
Republic was almost always at war
The Republic expanded and so
did Roman roads After the death
of Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar
became emperor Rome officially
became an empire He built up

Rome’s opponents Roads were
strengthened He brought in a
time of relative peace And during

_Roman leader_

his reign, Jesus of Nazareth was
born at the edge of the empire, marking the beginning of
what would become the Christian religion


116


For the next few centuries after Augustus, different
emperors came and went Some of them were good
leaders, and some were not Roman emperors would
sometimes spend large amounts of money on chariot races
or gladiator games and other **luxuries** Many would not
spend enough on things that made the Romans safe For
hundreds of years, most continued to actively persecute
Christians


One example was the emperor Nero Nero came to
power about 40 years after the death of Augustus Under
Nero’s rule, most of the capital city was destroyed It was
remembered as the Great Fire of Rome The fire started
in the market near the Circus Maximus It quickly spread
and destroyed most of the city Emperor Nero was known


117


to spend large amounts on the arts and music According to
legend, he “fiddled while Rome burned ” Some people even
believed he started the fire himself!


No matter who was emperor, the large size of the
empire created problems The Roman Empire simply
became too vast to handle, even with the roads It was
impossible for one emperor to control everything that
was happening over thousands of miles of territory The
governors and generals in charge of the Roman provinces
could do as they pleased


The Roman Empire was so vast and complex that it needed
to be divided into two parts: the Western Roman Empire, with
Rome as its capital; and the Eastern Roman Empire


_Map of Roman_ _**Empire**_ _divided into the East and West_
118


The Eastern Roman Empire would be ruled from a
new capital city, called Constantinople Constantinople
was named after Constantine the Great


Constantine brought new hope and confidence
to many Romans His new city of Constantinople
was a chance at a fresh start for the entire empire
There was still conflict and warfare, but Constantine
successfully united the Eastern and Western Empires
for his lifetime He credited his success to God and
became a Christian


Christianity became
formally supported by the
government of the Roman
empire Before Constantine,
the Christian faith spread by
word of mouth from travelers
on Roman roads They would
sometimes carry hand-written
copies of texts written by early

_Constantine the Great_

followers of Jesus In 325 AD,
Constantine **convened** a special council of church
leaders, called the Council of Nicaea, to discuss
and define key beliefs about Jesus Many Roman
laws were changed, informed by the values of the


119


new faith The empire remained complex and would
experience decline, but Christianity would remain a
key part of Rome from Constantine to today


_Council of Nicaea_


120


**Chapter**

**From Constantine to Justinian**


Constantine was the first
Roman **Emperor** to support
Christianity He issued an
order that made it illegal to put
Christians to death, or even
throw them in jail


Constantine built churches
all over the **empire**, including
the completion of an enormous _Constantine_
church called _The Basilica Nova_
He built one in Bethlehem, where Jesus was born He
built another in Jerusalem, where Jesus died He built
churches in the ancient city of Byzantium, in present-day
Turkey Byzantium was Constantine’s favorite city He
adopted it and renamed it Constantinople His goal was
to turn the city into a “new Rome,” a sort of Rome away
from Rome


121


_Constantine created many buildings, including_
The Basilica Nova _._

Constantine did not want Constantinople to replace
Rome He hoped that Constantinople would take its
place beside Rome and that the two cities would survive,
side by side, for many years He wanted Rome and
Constantinople to be like two mighty **pillars** supporting
the Roman Empire But, in the end, one of those **pillars**
**collapsed**


122


One of the **emperors** who ruled after Constantine
decided his job was just too big He felt that the Roman
**Empire** was too large to be ruled by any one man, so
he split the **empire** into two parts He declared that
the western half of the Empire would be ruled by one
**emperor**, based in Rome; the eastern half would be ruled
by a second **emperor**, based in Constantinople


_Map of Roman_ _**Empire**_ _and Byzantine_ _**Empire**_

Eventually, the Eastern Roman **Empire** completely
separated from the Western Roman **Empire** Once
separated, it wasn’t called the Eastern Roman Empire
anymore By 410 **AD**, the Eastern **Empire** was known as
the Byzantine **Empire**


123


Not long after the **empire** was divided, **invaders**
from the North began attacking the Western **Empire**
Things got worse and worse The **invaders** even attacked
Rome itself By 500 **AD**, the Western Empire had
**collapsed**, with most of the provinces falling to one
**barbarian** tribe or another


The Western Empire in Europe— from Italy across
France and Germany and all the way to Britain—drifted
into a long, sad period without leadership and **vision**
from the powers of Rome The glorious Roman **Empire**
finally came to an end


The Eastern **Empire**, based in Constantinople,
had better luck It lived on, and for a while, even got
stronger


Most **historians** agree that the Eastern Empire was at
its best during the **reign** of Justinian Justinian came into
power in the year 527 AD That is, he became **Emperor**
of Byzantium 527 years after the birth of Jesus and about
two hundred years after Constantine decided to support
Christianity It was also about this time that years began
by some to be formally marked as AD – _Anno Domini_,
Latin for “in the year of the Lord ”


124


_Justinian_


Like Constantine before him, Justinian was a
Christian He spent lots of money building churches
In Constantinople, he built the church of Hagia Sophia

[ho-GEE-ə Soe-FEE-yə], with its **magnificent**, soaring
dome that is still standing today


Justinian also completed an important book project
He had scholars gather up all of the laws that had been
passed in the Roman **Empire** over the years What the
scholars found was a big mess There were so many laws,
nobody could possibly keep track of them all There
were old laws that no longer made sense There were
even laws that seemed to be the opposite of one another


125


_The inside of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople_


126


One law might say “it is **illegal** to do X ” Then another
law might say “it’s perfectly fine to do X ” Justinian had his
scholars gather up all the laws, sort them out, and organize
them When they were done, they published the laws The
new, organized laws filled several books The new organized
laws were known as **Justinian’s Code** The Justinian Code
is one of Justinian’s major accomplishments as **emperor**
Justinian appears in the center of this **mosaic**, which you
can see today in an Italian church

**Chapter**
**Monarchy vs.**
**Republic**
### **17**



**King’s**
**Report**



For many years, Rome was governed by kings Some
of these kings were good men who ruled well Some were
bad men who treated the Romans poorly


One of the kings was so bad he convinced the
Romans that they should get rid of kings altogether
His name was Tarquin The Romans called him Tarquin
the Proud Tarquin was a tyrant He was a **cruel** ruler
who treated the people badly In the end, the people got
so mad at Tarquin that they joined together and drove
him out


Once King Tarquin had been driven out, the Romans
set up a different sort of government They set up a
republic—a kind of government with no kings


128


|What Are the<br>Differences?|Monarchy|Republic|
|---|---|---|
|**_Who rules?_**|The king rules|Elected officials rule|
|**_How long is the_**<br>**_rule?_**|<br>The king usually<br>rules until he dies|<br>Officials serve for<br>a set length of time|
|**_Who replaces the_**<br>**_ruler?_**|<br> <br>A king is usually<br>succeeded by his<br>oldest son|<br> <br> <br> <br>A new official is<br>elected to replace<br>the previous official|



_How is a monarchy different from a republic?_



129


One of the most important parts of the Roman
republic was the Senate The Senate was a group of older
men who met to make decisions and pass laws Many of
the senators were from old, wealthy families Almost all
of them had fought in the army and earned the trust of
their fellow Romans


Each year, the people would elect two men to serve
as consuls To be chosen as a consul was a great honor It
was the most powerful position in the Roman republic


Rome was a republic, but it was not a democracy
Some people played a role in the government, but many
more played no role at all


In the early years of the Roman republic, one group
held most of the power These were the patricians
The word _patrician_ comes from the **Latin** word pater,
or father The patricians thought of themselves as the
fathers of the people They felt that it was their job to
take care of the people in the same way that parents take
care of their children The patricians were from wealthy,
old families All of the men in the Senate were patricians
In the early days of the republic, the men selected to be
consuls were also patricians


130


The rest of the people—the ones who were not
patricians—were called plebeians The plebeians were the
poorer people In the early years of the republic, they had
very little power


The Roman republic lasted for more than five
hundred years Many Romans loved the republic They
thought it was the best kind of government a country
could have They were, however, not the only ones who
thought so


131


The Founding Fathers of the United States also
believed a republic was the best kind of government
When the colonies declared their independence from
Great Britain in 1776, they broke away from a king
(King George III) and set up a republic They created
a Senate that was modeled on the Roman Senate
They created a president who was a lot like the Roman
consuls They even built government buildings that
looked like ancient Roman buildings So you can see that
Roman ideas about government have had a big **influence**
all around the world


_This is the U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C._
_Many American government buildings look like ancient_
