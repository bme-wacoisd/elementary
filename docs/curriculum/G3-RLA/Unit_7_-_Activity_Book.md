**Ice Age Cause and Effect Chain**


I want you to imagine a time long, long ago. In this ancient time,
some people began to move from one land to another. These **prehistoric**
people were **migratory** hunters who traveled in groups. These prehistoric
people began to move from the land we call Asia into the land we call
North America. It is believed today that groups of people ventured between
Asia and North America taking varying routes, through different waves
of migration. It is likely that people first came to the Americas in boats,
following the coastline in search of land and food, and then stayed because
they discovered an abundance of new resources. The migration of people
and animals did not happen all at one time, nor did these people come from
only one place. People moved from across Asia into North America over a
period of time.


**Cause** **Effect**


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 7** **3**


Anthropologists once believed that eventually, as the weather began to
warm and the ice-covered land began to thaw, it became possible to travel even
farther into North America. Giant glaciers that had blocked Native peoples’
paths melted. People moved south through an area that opened up between
two enormous glaciers. Scientists call this path between these glaciers the IceFree Corridor. This corridor, or passage, was cold and wet, but habitable.

As the earth’s weather patterns changed and it became warmer, the way
these early peoples lived changed, too. Gradually, many prehistoric animals
that had been hunted for their meat, fur, and bones disappeared from our
world forever. Were they hunted to extinction by people struggling to survive
in a changing world? Or, did earth’s changing weather patterns alter the
delicate balance of the food chain to such an extent that these mammoths
could no longer find the foods they needed to live? We will never know for
certain the answer to these questions. We do know that the saber-toothed
tiger and the woolly mammoth no longer wander this land, whereas other
ancient creatures, such as the bison, did survive.

**Family Letter**



Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing the spelling patterns for /ә/ spelled ‘a’ and ‘e’
that we have already learned. Your student will be assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _American_ and
_independent_ . Challenge Words are words used very often and need to be
memorized. The Challenge Words do follow the spelling patterns for this
week as both ‘a’s in _American_ and the first and last ‘e’s in _independent_ are
pronounced /ә/.

The Content Word for this week is _glistening_ . This word is directly related
to the material that we are reading in _Native American Stories_ . The Content
Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student would
like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the
assessment. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit and try to
spell this word.

**Student Reader**





The chapters your student will read this week in _Native American Stories_
are a collection of stories about different groups of Native Americans. These
selections are historical fiction and each is told from a child’s point of view.
Students will learn about these children’s contributions to their tribes. This
week, students will read about a hunter and gatherers. Be sure to ask your
student each evening about what they are learning.

Once the Europeans
arrived in North America,
the Native tribes would
face new people, new
technology, new diseases,
and new cultures. They
would need to adapt, just
as their environments had
required them to adapt
for centuries before. For
many tribes, much of
their traditional way of
life would not be able to
survive the changes.


In the next part of this unit,
you will learn about some
of the tribes who survived,
and still live, in various
parts of North America.
These resilient tribes have
thriving cultures, and some
still practice traditional
ceremonies and speak
Native languages. You will
discover what made them
unique and knowledgeable,
and how they have helped,
and continue to help, shape
the history and culture of
the United States.

**“The Sparrow”**


A little bird, with plumage brown,
Beside my window flutters down,
A moment chirps its little strain,
Ten taps upon my window-pane,
And chirps again, and hops along,
To call my notice to its song;
But I work on, nor heed its lay,
Till, in neglect, it flies away.


So birds of peace and hope and love
Come fluttering earthward from above,
To settle on life’s window-sills,
And ease our load of earthly ills;
But we, in traffic’s rush and din
Too deep engaged to let them in,
With deadened heart and sense plod on,
Nor know our loss till they are gone.

So near, strumming, strumming,
So lazy and hum-strumming.

**“Akando and Aponi, the Gatherers”**


I stared up at the blue sky and **squinted** . It was hot. There was not a
cloud in the sky. Even though the leaves on the trees were now changing to
splendid colors that made me stop and stare, the intense heat of the sun still
**lingered** . I stood for a moment and rested my tired feet. I could tell that the
heat of the day would soon be replaced by an explosive thunderstorm.


I glanced back toward our village, but it was now almost completely
out of sight. I couldn’t see the roofs of the houses and storage rooms, nor
the smoke rising up from each family **hearth** . I could, however, still see our
chief’s home. I could also still glimpse the **ceremonial** buildings that sat
upon the large mounds that my people **constructed** .


My brother Akando and I had been sent out with our baskets to gather
wild fruits, berries, and nuts. In fact, this was the time of the year when most
of the children in our village were put to work. This was the time of year
when the children gathered nuts, fruits, and berries that could be **preserved**
or dried. We also gathered wild onions and **milkweed** . This food would be

needed when the earth was frozen. It was important that we gathered what
nature provided for us before the rains came and washed it all away or the
frost came and killed it.

The crops that we grew, sunflowers, corn, squash, and **tobacco**, were also
being harvested. Some of the older children were busily helping in the fields.
Only the spiritual leaders were allowed to gather **tobacco** and the roots and
bark that were used for medicine.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 7** **37**


I looked ahead, in search of Akando. My brother was so far ahead of me
that I was losing sight of him.


“Akando, slow down,” I called to my brother. “Can we rest for a while?”


Akando looked back at me. He is my twin brother and even though we
are the same size, he is stronger than I am. Akando had a large **birch** bark
basket strapped around his waist. It was almost full to the brim with hickory
nuts and hazelnuts. I had a basket strapped to my waist too. Mine was
smaller than his and it was only half full with butternuts and acorns.


“Just for a short while, Aponi,” he yelled back. “We haven’t even begun to
collect the berries.”


Akando walked back and sat down beside me on the ground. “Want to
play a game?” he asked.


“Yes. What game?” I replied eagerly.


“We’ll play a guessing game,” Akando replied. “Now, turn away until I say
you can look.”


Akando was very bossy but I loved him. He always stuck up for me when
some of the children in the village teased me.


“Okay, ready!” said Akando.

I turned around to see that three large, **autumnal** oak leaves had been
placed on the ground. Akando had placed a stone under one of them and I
had to guess which one. I only had one guess. We would do this three times,
then we would switch and Akando would have to guess. He always beat me.


“The one in the middle,” I said hopefully.

“Wrong!” exclaimed Akando. “It’s the one on the left,” he said as he lifted
up the leaf to reveal the stone.


My next guess was also wrong, but my third and final guess was correct.


“Now, it’s your turn,” I said.


As always, Akando beat me. He got two out of three guesses right.


“Okay, let’s go,” he said, urging me on. “The sooner we gather all that we
can, the sooner we can return home.”


“I guess,” I said but I continued to sit on the ground.


“Later on, if you like, I will show you how to beat me in the guessing
game,” Akando offered, trying to spur me on.


It worked.


“Really?” I asked, jumping to my feet and picking up my basket.


“Really!” Akando replied. “But first you have to fill that basket!”


“Okay,” I said, smiling at him.


Then, I grabbed my brother’s hand and walked with him beneath the
canopy of red-, gold-, and **copper** -colored leaves.

**Finding the 5Ws and How**

_Using the paragraphs below, complete the 5Ws and How list._


The final prehistoric cultural group of North American Mound Builders
was the Mississippian cultural group. This was perhaps the most developed
mound culture of all. They were a people who relied on corn as their most
important food crop. They lived in large towns, sometimes referred to as
city-states. They were populated by hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
The largest Mississippian town was Cahokia (kuh-ho-kee-uh) in Missouri.


Within each Mississippian town, there were several mounds, but
the most important mound was a flat-topped mound upon which sat a
religious temple or a ruler’s home. The flat-topped mound was usually
constructed in a central plaza. Mississippian mounds were several stories
high and were symbols of the people’s religious beliefs. They were expert
craftspeople, artists, and builders. The people were governed by powerful
leaders and priests, and their religious beliefs touched every aspect of their
lives. When Europeans came to North America, they encountered the
Mississippian people.


The largest mound in this town is one of the mounds still in existence
today and is known as Monk’s Mound. It covers an area of sixteen acres. It is
larger at its base than the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt!

**“Alemeda, the Basket Weaver”**


“Alemeda! Where are you?” my mother called.


I did not answer. Instead, I crept around the corner of our home and hid.
I waited and watched in the cooling shade. I held my breath. I was just about
to close my eyes when a lizard raced across my bare feet. It tickled.


“She’s hiding from you,” my younger brother Kele announced. “She’s over
there,” he said, pointing towards me.


I did not reply but stuck my tongue out at Kele. He was always getting me
into trouble.


“Alemeda, we need you. We have work to do. We must finish the baskets,”
my mother said, as I made my way towards her. She was not angry but it was
clear that she was not going to let me play. I had work to do.


I walked slowly towards the shaded area that my father had constructed
out of wooden poles and a covering. I kicked at the dirt as I walked. There
were several of these structures scattered around our village. Women could
be found sitting under them weaving baskets of various shapes and sizes.
They also created a whole **host** of other things. Men could be found sitting
together shaping tools for hunting and farming.


All of the women in our village made baskets. Baskets were very
important because they were used for carrying water, for storing grain, fruits,
nuts, and berries, and even for cooking.


“Sit near me,” my grandmother said as I came and stood beside her.


I sighed deeply and threw myself down on the ground next to her.

Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 7** **59**


She smiled and handed me the basket I had begun to make the day before.


“Our people have been making these baskets since time began,” she said.
“This skill has been handed down from one **generation** to the next. It is
important that you learn it, Alemeda.”


“I know,” I replied, and then I sighed again. “But I would rather learn
how to hunt than weave baskets,” I admitted.


My grandmother laughed out loud. “When I was your age, I thought the
same thing,” she replied.


“Really?” I asked, looking at her wise, old face. “Then, why are you
making me do it?” I asked eagerly, wondering if there was a way out.


Grandmother looked at me for a few moments before she replied. Then
she asked, “When you hunt, or fish, or even farm, what are you going to do
with the food you have provided?”


“Eat it!” I exclaimed cheerfully.


“But we can’t eat everything at once,” she chuckled. “We must save the
corn we harvest. We must dry some of the meat we hunt for, we must store
the fruits and berries we gather. We must store this food safely so that we can
survive during the time when the sun has turned away from us. You will come
to see, Alemeda, how important it is to learn this skill. Now, remember what
I told you yesterday. All **coiled** baskets are made from plants that bend easily.
Plants such as yucca, split willow, rabbitbrush, or skunkbrush are the best.”

“I remember,” I said, still not convinced that I wouldn’t be happier
hunting. “Is that why we can also make rope, sandals, mats, and even
clothes out of these plants that bend easily?” I asked, trying not to sound
too interested.


“Yes, these plants have many uses. But it is our skill as weavers that
enables us to make these things.”


Together we began to weave the baskets that my people had been making
since time began.

**Family Letter**



Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing spelling patterns for /ә/ + /l/ spelled ‘al’, ‘le’,
and ‘el’, and /sh/ + /ә/ + /n/ spelled ‘tion’ that we have already learned. Your
student will be assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _important_ and _children_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. The Challenge Words do not
follow the spelling patterns for this week and need to be memorized.

The Content Word for this week is _ceremonial_ . This word is directly
related to the material that we are reading in _Native American Stories_ . The
Content Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student
would like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the
assessment. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit and try to
spell this word.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 7** **63**


|The spelling words, including the Ch are listed below:|hallenge Words and the Content Word,|

**Student Reader**





The chapters your student will read this week in _Native American Stories_
include stories about forest children and a dog trainer. Additional chapters
your student may read include a story about the children of a corn festival
and an Inuit myth about how a crow brought daylight to people living in
darkness. Be sure to ask your student each evening about what they are
learning.

Very important to the Iroquois was something called wampum. Wampum
was an artistic way of communicating important thoughts and decisions.
Wampum was belts and necklaces made from colored shells. The color and
design of the beads could tell a story, or they could be a symbolic means of
communication. Wampum could also be used when trading. It was therefore
a kind of currency. Wampum was considered to be very valuable and was an
important part of Iroquois culture.

**“Texas Paintbrush”**


Long ago, amongst the rolling hills of Central Texas, the Comanche
people faced hard times. A **drought** had gripped the land. Rain refused
to fall. The sun burned hot and fierce. The once green hills lay brown and
wilted. The rivers and streams slowly dried up until even the strongest were
mere trickles. The buffalo herds the Comanche depended on were drifting
further and further away.


The dry days became weeks, and the weeks became months. And still,
the drought remained.


“I fear the worst,” one of the elders said one night at the council fire. The
other elders nodded. There was less and less food to be found for the people
of the tribe.

“All we have stored for the winter is **pemmican**,” another elder grumbled.
“Old pemmican, and not enough of it.” There was more muttering around
the fire. “We should leave these lands for greener pastures, where the rain
still falls and the rivers flow.”


Voices rose in protest. As hard as things were, few wanted to leave on a
long journey to unknown lands. Finally, the eldest and wisest of the elders
stood up. “We must remain hopeful and strong,” the elder **urged** them.
“Until the rains come and the grass grows.”


It was during this troubled time that a young Comanche girl named
Bright Feather was growing up. She was gifted with a heart full of hope and
a talent to paint. Each day, she wandered the plains, picking up roots and


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 7** **121**


berries. Once she **crushed** them and mixed them with water, she would have
paints of the most **vibrant** colors. She used brushes made from the finest
**hind** fur of a deer. Sometimes, the entire tribe would gather to watch her
paint and marvel at the result.


“Bright Feather’s paintings are the brightest things in these dark days,”
the elders said.


Her most prized item was a small jar with paint made from a special
flower that had not bloomed since her grandmother’s time. The paint was
a bright red, as vivid as a raging prairie fire. Many times, she had thought
about using the paint, but each time, she stopped herself. “I only have
enough to use once,” she thought to herself. “Then it will be gone forever.”


One hot night, Bright Feather had a dream. In her dream, she was
standing on a hill looking over her tribe, watching the sun set. As the sun
slowly sank, it lit the sky with colors more dazzling than anything she had
seen before. The light touched the brown land, and suddenly, it began to
bloom. The grass grew green and tall. The streams filled with clear rushing
water. Life returned to the land around her.


When she woke, Bright Feather was filled with hope. She set out to bring
her dream to life. She gathered her paints and brushes and set out for the
hill outside her tribe. She began to paint. With each stroke of the brush, the
painted sunset grew brighter and fuller. The Comanche people began to drop
by the hillside to watch as Bright Feather painted.


Day after day, she painted without rest or food or water. She knew that
something was missing from her painted sunset.

“It is not bright enough,” Bright Feather said firmly and kept painting.


Finally, she realized what was needed. With a heavy heart, she took her
cherished jar of vibrant red paint and used it to finish her painting. Members
of the tribe stood around her, gazing at her painted sunset. They marveled at
the stunning colors. It gave them hope that the hard times could not last.

**Weary** but satisfied, Bright Feather set her brushes down, still stained red
with the last of her cherished paint. Then, she fell into a deep sleep.


When she woke up, she found that her paintbrushes had sprouted roots.
The grass of the hillside was now covered with flowers of the same fiery red
as her cherished paint. Looking around, she saw that the plains around the
land, as far as the eye could see, were blanketed in the same vibrant colors—
the colors of the setting sun in her painting.


Seeing the flowers, one of the elders said, “They remind me of a prairie
fire. We should call them that.”


Bright Feather shook her head and said, “No, we should call them
paintbrushes.”


Just as in her dream, the rains began to fall. Green grass grew amongst
the red flowers. The rivers filled, and the buffalo herds returned. The land
once again began to **thrive**, thanks to Bright Feather.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 7** **123**


Even today, the beautiful red paintbrush flowers bloom every spring
in Texas when the rains fall. They remind us of Bright Feather’s hope and
creativity, and the power of selflessness. And mostly, they remind us that
even in the hardest of times, hope remains.

**Geronimo: His Own Story**

_Geronimo was a famous Apache. He fought for his people in many wars. He fought_
_against American settlers. He fought against Mexican settlers, too. In the end, the_
_Apache people were defeated. Geronimo had to spend the rest of his life on_
_a reservation._

_When he was an old man, Geronimo told the story of his life. It was published as_
Geronimo: His Own Story _. The following is his description of his youth._


I was born in No-doyohn Canyon, Arizona, in June, 1829.


In that country, which lies around the headwaters of the Gila River, I was
reared. This range was our fatherland. Among these mountains our wigwams
were hidden. The scattered valleys contained our fields. The boundless
prairies, stretching away on every side, were our pastures. The rocky caverns
were our burying places.


I was the fourth in a family of eight children. As a babe, I rolled on the
dirt floor of my father’s tipi. I was warmed by the sun, rocked by the winds,

and sheltered by the trees as other Apache babes.


My mother taught me the legends of our people. She taught me of the
sun and sky, the moon and stars, the clouds and storms. She also taught me
to kneel and pray for strength, health, wisdom, and protection.


My father told me of the brave deeds of our warriors. He told me of the
joys of the chase and the glories of the warpath.


With my brothers and sisters, I played about my father’s home.
Sometimes, we played at hide-and-seek among the rocks and pines.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 7** **127**


Sometimes, we sat in the shade or went looking for berries while our
parents worked in the field. Sometimes, we pretended that we were warriors,
sneaking up on some imaginary enemy. Sometimes, we would hide from
our mom to see if she could find us. Sometimes, we would stay hidden for
many hours.


When we were older, we went to the field with our parents—not to
play, but to work. When the crops were to be planted, we broke the ground
with wooden hoes. We planted the corn in straight rows. We planted beans,
melons, and pumpkins too.


Our field usually contained about two acres of ground. The fields were
never fenced. Many families farmed in the same valley. All of them would
help protect the crops from deer and other wild animals.


Melons were gathered as they were needed. In the fall, pumpkins and
beans were gathered and placed in bags or baskets. Ears of corn were tied
together by the husks, then carried on the backs of ponies up to our homes.
Here, the corn was shelled. Then, the harvest was stored away in caves or
other secluded places to be used in winter.


When I was about ten years old, I began to follow the chase. To me, this
was never work. Out on the prairies wandered herds of deer, antelope, elk,
and bison.


Usually, we hunted bison on horseback using arrows and spears. Their
hides were used to make tipis and bedding.

It required more skill to hunt deer. We would spend hours sneaking up
on grazing deer. If they were in the open, we would crawl long distances on
the ground. Sometimes, we would keep weeds or brush before us, so that our
approach would not be noticed. Often, we would return with several deer.
We used the deer to make tipis and clothing. Perhaps no other animal was
more valuable to us than the deer.


In 1846, being seventeen years of age, I was admitted to the council of the
warriors. I was very happy for I could go wherever I wanted and do whatever
I liked. I had not been under the control of any individual, but the customs
of our tribe prohibited me from sharing the glories of the warpath until the
council admitted me. When opportunity offered after this, I could go on the
warpath with my tribe. I hoped soon to serve my people in battle. I had long
desired to fight with our warriors.

**Fire: A Cherokee Myth**


In the beginning, there was no fire. The world was cold and so were the
animals who lived in it.


Then, the Thunders, who live up in the skies, sent down their lightning.
The lightning struck a sycamore tree that grew on an island and a fire began
to burn in the hollow part of the tree.


The animals knew the fire was there. They could see the smoke. They
could smell it, too. But they were not sure how to get the fire. They held a
council to decide what to do.


“I will go and get the fire,” said the Raven. “I am big and strong. I can do
the job!”


So the Raven set off to get the fire. He flew across to the island and
landed on the sycamore tree. He perched on the tree and started thinking
about what to do next. But while he was thinking, the smoke rose up from
below and scorched his feathers. The Raven was scared. He flew back

without the fire and his feathers have been black ever since.


“I will get the fire,” said the little Screech Owl.


He flew over to the island and landed next to the tree. But just then, a
great gust of hot air came shooting out of the tree. The hot air singed the
Screech Owl’s eyes so badly he could barely see. He flew back, but it was a
long time until he could see well and his eyes are still red, even today.


“I will get the fire,” said the Hooting Owl.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 7** **133**


She flew over, but by the time she got there, the fire was burning brightly.
The smoke nearly blinded her and the ashes left her with white rings around
her eyes. She rubbed and rubbed, but she could not rub off the rings. So the
Hooting Owl has white rings around her eyes, even today.


“I will get the fire,” said the little Black Racer Snake.


He slithered into the water and swam to the island. Then, he crawled
through the grass until he got to the sycamore tree. He slithered into a little
hole at the bottom of the tree. But the smoke and fire were too much for him
to stand. He slithered out and began darting back and forth to shake off the
ashes. His body was scorched and blackened and that is why he is known as
the Black Racer Snake.


Well, after this, the animals had another council. Most of the four-footed
animals were afraid to go to the island. They all shook their heads.


At last, the Water Spider said she would go. She had black hair and red
stripes on her body. She could run on top of the water so she would be able
to get to the island. But how would she bring back the fire? That was what
the other animals wanted to know.


“I will manage,” said the Water Spider.


The Water Spider went dancing across the water. She scampered up to
the sycamore tree. Then, she began to spin a tiny thread from her belly. She
wove the thread into a little bowl and fastened the bowl to her back. She
backed up to the coals and got one little coal to fall into her bowl. Then, she
hurried back across the water.


Ever since then, we have had fire and the Water Spider has carried a little
bowl on her back.

**The Lion and His Advisors**

**(A Fable from Aesop)**


One night, the Lion and the Lioness got into an argument. All through
the night, they roared at each other, and their ferocious roaring could be
heard a mile away.


“You are worthless!” roared the Lioness. “You never do anything! My
sisters and I do most of the hunting. All you do is sleep and lie around the
den all day! On top of it all, your breath smells bad!”


“It does not!” roared the king of the jungle in his loudest voice. But, as
soon as he said this, the Lion began to wonder. Did his breath really smell
bad? He had never smelled his own breath. Was it even possible to smell your
own breath? How could he find out if his breath was smelly?


In the morning, the Lion decided to send for three of his advisors, the
Sheep, the Wolf, and the Fox.


He summoned the Sheep into his den first.


“Sheep,” the Lion said, “tell me and tell me truly. Does my breath
smell bad?”


The Sheep thought the Lion wanted to know the truth.


“Your Majesty,” the Sheep said, “since you have asked me for the truth,
I will not conceal it from you. Your breath does smell bad. In fact, it
smells horrible.”


That was not what the Lion wanted to hear. He roared and gobbled up
the Sheep.

“Wolf,” he said, “tell me and tell me truly. Does my breath smell bad?”


The Wolf thought the Lion would be upset to learn the truth. He decided
this was a situation in which it would be smarter to lie.


“Your Majesty!” said the Wolf, “I can’t imagine where you got such an
idea. Your breath most certainly does not smell bad. On the contrary, it
smells wonderful! Why, your breath is as fresh as a spring breeze wafting
through a valley of fragrant herbs and blooming flowers!”


“You lie!” said the Lion. He roared and gobbled up the Wolf.


Then, the Lion summoned the Fox.


“Fox,” he said, “tell me, and tell me truly. Does my breath smell bad?”


“Ah-choo!” said the Fox, pretending to sneeze. He wiped his nose and
said, “Excuse me, Your Majesty. I have a terrible cold today. My nose is all
stopped up. I’m afraid I can’t smell a thing.”

in New Mexico. The houses in the Taos Pueblo are made of stone and


mud. The mud is called adobe.


The houses in the pueblo are built side-by-side. In some cases, they


are built one on top of another. From a distance, the pueblo looks like


it is all one building. But that is not the case. In fact, it is made up of


many houses. The houses share walls, but they are separate.


There are many pueblos in the Southwest. The Taos Pueblo is one of


the oldest. It was built about 1,000 years ago. People have been living in


it ever since. It is the oldest continuously inhabited town in the United


States.


There were Native Americans living in the Taos Pueblo when


Christopher Columbus set sail in 1492. Some of those people were


still alive in 1540, when Coronado explored the Southwest. One of


Coronado’s captains visited Taos.


Eventually, the Spanish took over the Southwest. Many Native Americans


began to follow the teachings of Christianity. But some resisted.


In 1680 a Native American leader named Popé planned to resist.

**The Taos Pueblo**


Popé used the Taos Pueblo as his base. From Taos, he sent


messages to other pueblos. He urged the Native people to fight against


the Spanish. He set a date.


He wanted all of the Native people to rise at the same time. The


Pueblo Revolt was a success, at least at first. The Native Americans


drove the Spanish out. For 10 years, they ruled themselves. In the


end, however, the Spanish took over once again.


The Taos Pueblo remained part of the Spanish Empire for many


years. Eventually, New Mexico became part of the United States.


Today, the Taos Pueblo is part of a Native American reservation.


About 100 people live in the pueblo today. Some of them are


descendants of the men who greeted Coronado’s men; others are


descendants of men who fought with Popé.


What is it like to live in the Taos Pueblo? It is an old-fashioned


sort of life in some ways. Most of the houses have only two rooms.

**The Taos Pueblo**


One room is for sleeping. The other is for cooking and eating. The


houses in the pueblo do not have electricity. They don’t have pipes


and running water, either.


In the old days, the Pueblo people had very little furniture. Nowa

days, most Pueblo houses have tables, chairs, and beds. So what do you


think? What do you think living in the Taos Pueblo would be like?
