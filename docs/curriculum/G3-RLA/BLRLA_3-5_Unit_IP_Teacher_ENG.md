## Unit Internalization | Bluebonnet Learning [TM] 3-5 Reading Language Arts

**Edition 1**









**Step 1: Understand the big picture.**






 - **Use the Unit Introduction:** Write and discuss 3-5 key takeaways students should have by the end of the
unit. You will refer to this when using the lesson internalization protocol. Identify background knowledge
from previous grade levels.

 - **Use the Scope and Sequence/Pacing Guide provided by your district:** note which days you will be
teaching the lessons and administering the assessments.

 - **Reflect:** Why is this unit important? How does it connect to the prior unit (if applicable)?

**Step 2: Know your destination.**

 - **Use the Table of Contents to locate the unit assessment** : if applicable, read and complete the end-of-unit
assessment as the students would, identifying the key sections of the assessment. Create an exemplar of
what mastery should look like on the end-of-unit assessment. Identify the literacy skills that students will
need to be successful in the assessment. Highlight the embedded supports you will use to ensure students
with disabilities, and gifted and talented learners can all access grade-level content.

 - **Use the TEKS chart in Teacher Resources:** Review the TEKS and ELPS being taught; highlight the TEKS and
ELPS that are being assessed. Read and understand what students should be able to do.

 - **Use the Unit Introduction:** Identify the formal writing piece students will complete during this unit.

 - **Reflect:** How will identifying the skills that students will need to be successful on the unit assessment impact
your daily instruction throughout the unit?

**Step 3: Examine the arc of learning.**

 - **Refer to the Table of Contents to see a list of lessons:** Review how the lessons build on one another.
Reference the Unit Introduction as needed to see how each skill area is developed across lessons. Identify how
the lessons connect to the unit assessment. Identify length of the unit and number of pausing point days.

 - **Reflect:** How will you support students who do not have the prior knowledge for the unit?

**Step 4: Organize your resources.**

 - **Use the Unit Introduction:** Review the instructional materials and additional resources
recommended throughout the unit.

 - **Reflect:** What would you like the Special Education and ESL teacher to do based on what you know about
the unit? How will those actions contribute to improved student outcomes?
