**Dear Family Members,**

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing all five spelling patterns for /j/ that we have
already learned. Your student will be tested on these words.

Students have been assigned three Challenge Words, _answer_, _great_, and
_grate_ . Challenge Words are words used very often. The Challenge Words do
not follow the spelling patterns for this week and need to be memorized.

The Content Word for this week is _Jupiter_ . This word is directly related
to the material that we are reading in _What’s in Our Universe?_ The Content
Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student would
like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the test
for trying. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit and try to spell
this world.

|The spelling words, i are listed below:|including the Challenge|e Words and the Content Word,|
|---|---|---|
|1. jellyfish|8. eject|15. average|
|2. germy|9. budget|16. fudge|
|3. digest|10. lodging|17. giraffe|
|4. fringe|11. gymnasium|**Challenge Word**: _answer_|
|5. nudging|12. jewel|**Challenge Word**: _great/grate_|
|6. ridge|13. bridging|**Content Word**: _Jupiter_|
|7. exchange|14. dodge||



Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **7**


**Student Reader**

The chapters your student will read this week in _What’s in Our Universe?_
include information about our solar system: the sun, Earth, our moon, the
eight planets, asteroids, comets, and meteors. Be sure to ask your student
each evening about what they are learning.

Students will take home text copies of the chapters in the reader
throughout the unit. Encouraging students to read a text directly related to
this domain-based unit will provide content and vocabulary reinforcement.
Your student will also bring home a copy of the glossary for use in reading
the text copies to family members. The bolded words on the text copies are
the words found in the glossary.

**DATE:**


**The Sun, Earth, and Our Solar System**


Look up in the sky at noon. What do you see? If it is not cloudy, you will
see the sun shining brightly in the sky.


The sun provides energy—both light and heat. The sun’s light and heat
give life to plants and animals. Without the sun, Earth would be freezing
cold. Have you ever wondered what the sun is made of or why it gives off so
much light and heat?


You may be surprised to know that the sun is a star. It is in fact the
closest star to Earth. It is made up of different, hot gases. How hot? A hot
summer day on Earth is 100 degrees. On the sun, it is 10,000 degrees! The
sun stays that hot all the time! The sun’s gases create the light and heat it
gives off.


Long ago, people believed that the sun moved around Earth. This seemed
to make sense. Each morning at the start of the day, the sun rose in the east.
At the end of the day, the sun set in the west—exactly opposite from where
it had come up. To explain this change, people said the sun moved around
Earth. But now we know that this is not what really happens. The sun does
not move around Earth. It is Earth that moves around the sun!

The sun is in the center of a group of eight **planets** . All of these **planets**,
including Earth, circle, or **orbit**, around the sun. The sun, **planets**, and other
objects in space that **orbit** the sun are called the **solar system** . The word _solar_
has the Latin root word _sol_, which means “the sun.” Everything in the **solar**
**system** relates to the sun.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **9**


Our **planet**, Earth, moves in two ways. We have just learned that Earth
circles around the sun. It takes about 365 days, which is one year, for Earth to
**orbit** the sun.

Earth also moves by spinning, or **rotating**, on its **axis** . It is this spinning
that makes day and night on Earth and the motion of the sun across the
sky from sunrise to sunset. It takes one day for Earth to make one complete
**rotation** on its axis. As Earth **rotates** and spins, different parts of it face the
sun. When the part facing the sun gets sunlight, it is daytime on that side
of Earth. The part that faces away from the sun gets no sunlight. So, on that
side of Earth, it is nighttime. Did you know that when it is daytime where we
live, it is nighttime on the other side of Earth?

When Earth **rotates** on its **axis**, it is **tilted** . At certain times of the year,
one part of Earth is **tilted** toward the sun. The sunlight is more direct and it
feels hotter. For people living on this part of Earth, it is summer. For people
living on the part of Earth **tilted** away from the sun, there is less sunlight and
it is winter. So, when it is summertime for us, there are people living on other
parts of Earth where it is winter! So, the fact that Earth is **tilted** on its **axis** is
what creates the seasons of the year.

**DATE:**


**Dear Family Members,**

Over the next several days, your student will be learning about astronomy,
the solar system, and galaxies. They will review the organization of the solar
system, with the sun at the center and Earth and the other planets orbiting it.
They will learn that gravity is an important force in the universe and will also
learn about galaxies, specifically the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.

Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to
reinforce what your student is learning about astronomy.

**1. Solar System Model**

During this unit your student will be seeing images of the planets and their
positions in the solar system. You may wish to reinforce this by working
with them to make your own model of the solar system out of play dough,
clay, or papier-mâché. You may wish to reference the diagram of our solar
system at the end of this letter. In your model, be sure to include the sun,
the eight planets, and the asteroid belt found between Mars and Jupiter. You
may also wish to include Earth’s moon, the moons of other planets, and/or
the dwarf planets Pluto and Ceres. (Pluto is no longer grouped with the eight
planets.) You may wish to try to recreate the colors of the planets as shown in
photographs taken by the Hubble telescope. (As you create your models, you
may wish to depict the orbits of the planets as well.)

**2. Gravity, Forces, and Mass**

Your student will be learning about a force called _gravity._ In this lesson, your
student will be introduced to many new words, that you may want to review
at home. Two of the words used are _force,_ which is a pull or push on an object
or system, and _mass,_ which is the amount of material something is made of.

**3. Out-of-This-World Images**

Your student has learned that a great deal of what we know about space has
been discovered through scientific observation. They have heard that scientists


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **11**


use telescopes to observe outer space and that the most famous of these is the
Hubble telescope. Your student has also learned about galaxies, what they are
made of, and how they are shaped. Search online for and visit the Hubble gallery
with your student to view photographs of the planets in our solar system, objects
in the universe, and various galaxies. You may also wish to search for related
television programs on Discovery, National Geographic, and PBS channels.

**4. Words to Use**

Below are several of the words that your student will be learning about and using.
Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

 - _satellite_ —The moon is Earth’s only natural satellite; Jupiter, however, has
more than sixty natural satellites.

 - _rotates_ —We experience daylight and the darkness of night because
planet Earth rotates around its axis once each day and causes different
parts of Earth to face the sun.

 - _cluster_ —Our Milky Way Galaxy is a cluster of billions of stars.

 - _gravity_ —Gravity is a force of attraction between two objects that pulls
the object with less mass toward the object with greater mass.

**5. Read Aloud Each Day**

It is very important that you read with your student every day. Set aside
time to read to your student and to listen to your student read to you. Books
related to astronomy may be found at your local library.

Be sure to praise your student whenever they share what has been learned
at school.

**The Moon**


Look up in the sky at night. What do you see? If it is not cloudy, you may
be able to see the moon.


When you see the moon at night, it might look white. It might look gray
or silver. Sometimes, it seems to shine and glow. But the moon does not give
off light the way the sun does. The moon is a ball of rock that gives off no
light of its own. It simply reflects light from the sun. That means light from
the sun hits the moon and bounces off.

You already know that Earth **orbits** around the sun. But did you know
that the moon **orbits** around Earth? It takes just about one month for
the moon to completely circle Earth. If you look up at the night sky each
night of the month, you may think that the size and shape of the moon is
changing. However, the size and shape are not really changing. The moon is
still a round ball. It looks different at different times of the month because
of the way the light from the sun is reflected and how much of the moon we
can see from Earth.


The way that Earth, the moon, and the sun move can also make other
interesting things to look at in the sky. When Earth, the moon, and the sun
all move together in a direct line, something called an **eclipse** can take place.

We can see two kinds of **eclipses** from Earth. One kind happens when
the moon gets in between the sun and Earth. When that happens, we can’t
see the sun for a while. At least, we can’t see part of it. We call this a solar
**eclipse** or an **eclipse** of the sun.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **19**


The other kind of **eclipse**, called a lunar eclipse, also involves the sun, the
moon, and Earth. It takes place when the moon passes behind Earth and into
its shadow. It is Earth’s shadow that you see. Earth has blocked out the sun
and left part of the moon in darkness.

**Eclipses** do not happen often because the sun, Earth, and the moon all
have to line up just right. Solar **eclipses** can only be seen from a narrow strip
of Earth at a time. While they happen once or twice a year, it is very, very
rare to see one. **Eclipses** of the moon happen more often, several times each
year. They can be seen from half of Earth at a time, so are more often visible.

Whether or not you can see an **eclipse** depends on where you are on
Earth. You must never look directly at a solar **eclipse** . The sun is very bright
and could burn your eyes. But, it is safe to look at an **eclipse** of the moon. If
an **eclipse** is predicted, it is usually big news, so you will likely hear about it.

**The Planets Closest to the Sun:**
**Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars**


Our planet Earth is one of eight planets in our solar system that orbit
around the sun. The other planets are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune. People have been looking at the planets for thousands
of years. People from Mesopotamia, the Greeks, Mayans, Incas, and Aztecs
were all interested in the planets. They used just their **naked eye** to study the
planets. Now, we have telescopes and other tools that help us get a better look
at the planets.


The four planets closest to the sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—
are small planets. These planets have a rocky, or solid, surface.


Mercury and Venus are closer to the sun than Earth. The other planets
are farther away.


Earth needs 365 days to make one orbit around the sun. That is the
length of one year on Earth.


The closer a planet is to the sun, the less time it needs to make an orbit
around the sun. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. It needs just 88 days
to make one orbit. Venus is the next closest to the sun. It needs just 225 days
to make an orbit. The planets that are farther away take much longer. It takes
Neptune 165 years to orbit the sun!


Besides being closest to the sun, Mercury is the smallest of all the
planets. The English name for the planet comes from the Romans. They
named the planet after the Roman god Mercury. The Greek name for this
same god is Hermes.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **27**


Venus is the second planet from the sun and is closest to Earth. This
planet was named after the Roman goddess of love. For a long time, scientists
thought that Venus might be a lot like Earth. After all, it is close to Earth. It is
about the same size as Earth and it is covered with clouds, like Earth. But this
idea turned out to be wrong, too. We know now that Venus and Earth are
different in lots of ways.


Scientists had to change their ideas to fit the new facts. They have now
concluded that Venus is much hotter than Earth. It would not be a good
place for us to live or even visit.


Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is named after the Roman god
of war. When you look at Mars in the night sky, it looks quite red. This is
because the rocks on Mars contain rust.

Many space **probes** and robots have landed on Mars. They have taken
photographs and also dug up rocks.

One **probe** that went to Mars not long ago found some ice. That was big
news. Ice is frozen water. If there is water on Mars, there might be life. Some
experts argue that nothing could live on Mars. They say it is too cold and

too dry. Others think there might be life on Mars. They think there might be
something alive down under the rocks. Still others think there might have
been life on Mars at one time but there isn’t any now.

**The Outer Planets:**
**Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune**


Do you remember the names of the four planets closest to the sun? If you
said, “Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars,” you are right! There are four more
planets called the outer planets. So there are eight planets in all.


Jupiter is the very next planet after Mars. After Jupiter come Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune in that order. Neptune is the planet that is farthest
from the sun. Uranus is difficult to see with the naked eye and Neptune is
impossible to see without help. Neptune is only visible using a telescope.


The outer planets are very large and are mostly made of gas. Scientists
often call these planets **gas giants** . Of all the planets, Jupiter is the largest:
1,300 Earths could fit inside Jupiter! It is made mostly of **hydrogen** gas, the
most common gas in the universe.


The gases on Jupiter seem to be blowing around. When you see images of
Jupiter, you can see a giant red spot. It looks like an eye! Experts think it is a
big wind storm, like a huge hurricane.


Jupiter also has 63 known moons that orbit it. Some of these moons are
very large, even larger than Earth’s moon.


Saturn is known for its many large rings that orbit the planet. These rings
are made of ice and dust. The ice reflects light and makes the rings glow.
Saturn also has many moons that orbit it.


The last two planets are Uranus and Neptune. These planets are the
farthest from the sun so they are very cold. Uranus and Neptune also have
rings, but they aren’t easily seen like Saturn’s. Both planets also have moons.

So now you know the names of all eight planets. Try asking the adults
in your family how many planets there are. They may tell you that there are
nine planets. When the adults in your family were in school, people said that
there was a ninth planet called Pluto. But in 2006, scientists decided that
Pluto did not have all of the characteristics needed to be classified as a planet.
They removed Pluto’s name from the list of planets, so now there are only
eight planets.

**Dear Family Members,**

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing all four spelling patterns for /n/ that we have
already learned. Your student will be assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned three Challenge Words, _very_, _vary_, and
_enough_ . Challenge Words are words used very often. The Challenge Words
do not follow the spelling patterns for this week and need to be memorized.

The Content Word for this week is _astronomer_ . This word is directly related
to the material that we are reading in _What’s in Our Universe?_ The Content
Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student would
like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the test
for trying. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit and try to spell
this word.

|The spelling words, i are listed below:|including the Challenge|e Words and the Content Word,|

**Student Reader**

The chapters your student will read this week in _What’s in Our Universe?_
include information about our solar system: galaxies, stars, and constellations.
Students will also read chapters about exploring space, walking on the moon,
and what it’s like in space. Be sure to ask your student each evening about
what they are learning.

Students will take home text copies of the chapters in the reader throughout
the unit. Encouraging students to read a text directly related to this domainbased unit will provide content and vocabulary reinforcement. Please remind

**Galaxies and Stars**


Look up in the sky at night. What do you see besides the moon? If it is
not cloudy, you may be able to see lots of stars glittering in the sky.

Remember that the sun is also a star. The stars in the night sky do not look
like the sun. They do not look as big or as bright. But they are, in fact, very
much alike. The stars in the night sky are big balls of hot gas, just like the sun.

So why don’t they look the same? The night stars are much, much farther
away from Earth than the sun. That is why they look like tiny specks of light.
If we could get close to the stars, they would look bigger, brighter, and more
like the sun. But the stars we see at night are so far away that no one from
Earth has ever been able to get close to them.

Scientists who study the stars and outer space are called **astronomers** .
The Greek root word _astron_ means star. The prefix _astro_ is used in many
other English words.

All stars are big balls of hot gas, but **astronomers** have discovered that

stars differ in many ways. Stars can be different sizes and colors. Some stars
are closer to Earth than others and some stars are hotter than others. Stars
that are the hottest and closest to Earth appear brighter than other stars.

**Astronomers** also discovered that stars cluster together in large groups.
A large group of stars that cluster together in one area is called a **galaxy** _._
There are **billions** and **billions** of stars in one **galaxy** . That’s a lot of stars!

The **galaxy** to which our sun and solar system belong is called the **Milky**
**Way Galaxy** . It has a spiral shape when viewed from space. From Earth, it
looks like a “milky” band of white light.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **61**


The nearest spiral galaxy to the **Milky Way Galaxy** is called the
**Andromeda Galaxy** . It is **billions** and **billions** of miles from the **Milky**
**Way Galaxy** . There’s that number **billions** again. You have probably heard
of a million before. A million is a huge number. So what’s a **billion** ? It’s one
thousand million! It is safe to say that the **Andromeda Galaxy** is a long,
long, long way away! Even so, it is sometimes possible to see the **Andromeda**
**Galaxy** at night.

Scientists think there are **billions** of **galaxies** in the universe. There’s that
number **billions** again. There are **billions** of stars in each **galaxy** and **billions**
of **galaxies** in the universe—that is almost more than you can think about!

**“Galaxies”**


Isn’t space amazing? The thing that may amaze you most is how much
distance there is between the planets in our solar system. No wonder they
call it space! Now that we have reached the edge of our solar system, do you
want to see more closely what lies in the center? Before you can understand
what lies beyond our solar system, you need to know a little more about what
stars are. And the best place to start is with the star that lies at the center of
our solar system that you see every day: our very own sun.


The sun is so much brighter and bigger than all the rest of the stars
because we are so much closer to our star than we are to any other star. We
only see our star, the sun, in the daytime because that’s when we’re facing it.
And when the sun lights up our skies, it is so bright that we can’t usually see
any other stars in the daytime.


You can tell just by looking that there is no way a spaceship could
land on the sun—it’s a big mass of incredibly hot gas! There’s no solid
surface to land on. The sun, like all stars, is made mostly of a gas called

hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms in the center of the sun crash into each
other under intense heat and pressure. The hydrogen **atoms fuse**, or
join together, to form another gas called helium, and this fusion creates
energy you can see and feel in the form of light and heat. So, hydrogen
turning into helium produces vast amounts of energy, and is what causes
the sun to shine.


The amount of heat and light being produced by a star determines its
color. The surface of our sun is about ten thousand degrees Fahrenheit, not


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **63**


nearly as hot as the inside of the star! Even though ten thousand degrees
is really hot compared to boiling water, our sun is still only considered a
medium-hot, yellow star. Some stars are even hotter and some are not as hot
as our sun. In fact, our sun is not as hot as it used to be.


Scientists believe that all stars are made of more or less the same things:
hydrogen, helium, and smaller amounts of other basic substances. But just
because stars are made from huge amounts of hydrogen and helium doesn’t
mean that all stars are the same—they aren’t. The amount of substance or
mass that makes up each star can vary. And the substances that make up
some stars are more packed together than in others.


Stars have different ages, too. Some stars in the universe were literally just
born yesterday, and some—like the sun—are believed to be billions of years
old. But our sun is not at the end of its life either; many scientists believe our
sun still has **billions** of years yet to live! So stars can be very different from
each other.


Our sun seems large to us, and it is. In fact, it’s so large that more than
one million Earths could fit inside it! That’s a lot of Earths—and just one
Earth is pretty big. But believe it or not, our sun is small compared to many
other stars. There are stars in the universe that are two thousand times as
big as the sun! Our sun seems very bright to us, and it is. But there are stars
that are more than four million times as bright! Even so, there are stars that
are smaller than our sun and some that are less bright. So you see, stars can
differ in size, mass, color, brightness, temperature, and age. But the one thing
that most stars have in common is that they exist in groups called galaxies.


Do you remember how we defined our solar system as a neighborhood
of planets, asteroids, and other objects in orbit around a star? Well,


**64** **Unit 6 |** Activity Book Grade 3


**NAME:** ACTIVITY PAGE

**DATE:**


a galaxy is a **cluster** of many stars that orbit around together as an
even bigger neighborhood—like a country. So, a galaxy is basically a
gigantic country of stars. But all galaxies are not the same; they come
in many shapes and sizes. Some galaxies are **spiral** . Some galaxies are
elliptical in shape. Still other galaxies are **irregular** in shape, with no
particular pattern.

The galaxy that our solar system is in is called the **Milky Way Galaxy**,
which is a **spiral** galaxy. When you are standing on Earth you are in the
**Milky Way Galaxy** . If you look up into the sky on a very clear, dark night
away from the lights of a city, you can see a narrow band of thousands of
stars going through the sky. When you look at this cloudy-looking band,
you are looking into the thickest, densest part of the **Milky Way** . The
ancient Greeks called this band of stars the Milky Circle, and the ancient
Romans called it the Milky Road. But guess what? When you stand
outside of the Milky Way and look at it, it looks like a **spiral** .

This is a view of a spiral galaxy like the **Milky Way**, looking down on it.
Astronomers know what the Milky Way Galaxy looks like, but no person

or spaceship has ever traveled outside of the Milky Way to take a picture
of the whole galaxy. Scientists have figured out by using modern scientific
instruments that the Milky Way is a **spiral** galaxy and looks very much like
other **spiral** galaxies that we can take pictures of. As you can see, this spiral
**galaxy** has a bright center, or hub, of many bright stars with star-studded
arms swirling out from it amid clouds of gas.


How many stars do you think are in one galaxy? A single galaxy usually
contains between one **billion** and a few hundred **billion** stars. And that’s not


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **65**


even counting any planets or other objects that may be in orbit around all of
those **billions** of stars. In addition to **billions** of stars, galaxies also contain
clouds of gas and pieces of dust which can eventually come together to form
new stars.


And don’t forget—galaxies also include the space in between the stars
that are in it. There is a huge amount of space in space! Stars in the Milky
Way Galaxy can be one hundred thousand **light-years** away from each
other, or they can be five **light-years** away from each other, but most are
somewhere in between.

A **light-year** is the distance that light travels in one year. Light travels at
a speed of 186,282 miles per second. So one l **ight-year** is nearly six trillion
miles! That’s about six thousand billion miles. And you thought a **billion** was
big! Well, as you can see, stars in the same galaxy are very far away from each
other. Those are **astronomical** distances!


Astronomers use different kinds of powerful telescopes to see even more
distant parts of the Milky Way Galaxy. Some of those telescopes are on Earth,
and some are in orbit around Earth. And there are even a few telescopes
zooming through our solar system.


Astronomers share their observations, their photographs, and the data
they have gathered with each other—and luckily, with us, too. Even with all
of our powerful equipment, there are still things in the Milky Way Galaxy—
and beyond it—that no one has ever seen. Sometimes there is something in
the way, like a star or another galaxy, and some things are still too far away
even for our most powerful telescopes. There are more stars and galaxies in
the universe than we can imagine!

As you look out at the Milky Way, you may wonder about the other
galaxies out there. One of the closest galaxies to our Milky Way Galaxy
is called the Andromeda (/an*drom*eh*dah/) Galaxy. The Andromeda
Galaxy is a **spiral** galaxy like our Milky Way. Even though Andromeda is
the closest **spiral** galaxy to our galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy is still very
far away, and there is still much that remains unknown about it. Several
other small **irregular** galaxies lie between the Milky Way Galaxy and the
Andromeda Galaxy.


Now you know a lot more about our school’s “space address.” We
live on the planet Earth. Earth is the third planet from the sun in our
solar system, one of four small, rocky planets. Our solar system is just
one planetary system located in one of the **spiral** arms of the Milky
Way Galaxy.


You may be thinking about all of the other galaxies that exist besides our
galaxy. There are **billions** of galaxies in the universe. Another **astronomical**
number! “Wait,” you may be thinking, “let me get this right”.

“There are **billions** of galaxies . . . and all of them have billions of stars in
them? Wow—that’s so big I can’t even get my mind around it!” The universe
truly is an incredibly gigantic and vast place.

**“Escape at Bedtime”**

**By Robert Louis Stevenson**


The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out

Through the blinds and the windows and bars;

And high overhead and all moving about,

There were thousands of millions of stars.

There ne’er were such thousands of leaves on a tree

Nor of people in church or the Park,

As the crowds of stars that looked down on me,

And that glittered and winked in the dark.


The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all,

And the star of the sailor, and Mars,

These shone in the sky, and the pail by the wall

Would be half full of water and stars.

They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries,

And soon had me packed into bed;

But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes,

And stars going round in my head.

**Dear Family Members,**

Over the next few days, your student will be learning more about the
universe and space exploration, focusing on key figures such as Nicolaus
Copernicus and Mae Jemison.

Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to
reinforce what your student is learning about astronomy.

**1. Space Exploration**

Over the next few days, your student will be learning about NASA-led
space exploration. You may want to review with your student that space
exploration is one way astronomers learn more about the universe. Your
student will hear about the Apollo 11 mission to the moon and the astronaut
Mae Jemison. Ask your student to share what they remember about these
two topics. (Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first to set foot on
the moon; they traveled on a rocket; etc. Mae Jemison was the first female
African American astronaut.) You may wish to supplement what your
student has learned by visiting the NASA website to research current NASA
endeavors and the most recent astronauts and space explorations.

**2. Stargazing**

Go outside one evening and stargaze with your student. Point out any
constellations you know and have your student share with you any of the
constellations they have learned. You may also wish to point out any of the
planets visible in the night sky, like Venus or Mars. If you have access to
technology, such as a computer tablet or smartphone, you may wish to use a
stargazing application.

If you live in a city, it may be hard to see stars because light pollution will
interfere with the light from the stars. Sometimes the outskirts of a city, or even a
high point in the city, have less light pollution, making stars more visible. You may
want to consider traveling to one of these areas to stargaze. You may also wish to
visit a science museum or planetarium to observe constellations more closely.

Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **79**


**3. Words to Use**

Below are several of the words that your student will be learning about
and using. Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with
your student.


   - _expanding_ —Te balloon is expanding with each breath I blow into it.

   - _constellations_ —Ancient peoples created stories about groups of stars
that made patterns called constellations in the night sky in the shapes
of people, animals, and other objects.

   - _opposed_ —In Copernicus’s time, many people opposed the idea that the
sun was at the center of the solar system.


**4. Read Aloud Each Day**

It is very important that you read with your student every day. Set aside
time to read to your student and to listen to your student read to you.

Be sure to praise your student whenever they share what has been learned
at school.

**Exploring Space**


As you have learned in the last chapters, people have been
interested in studying space since ancient times. It was possible to
see only some stars and planets with the naked eye. Since they were
far, far away, it was impossible to see anything in very much detail.

In 1609, an astronomer named Galileo [ga-li-lae-oe] created a
telescope that he used to observe the night sky. Galileo’s telescope
made things appear three times larger. Using his telescope, he
discovered four of the many moons that orbit the planet Jupiter. He
also observed the planet Saturn and the Milky Way.

Since Galileo’s time, scientists have created more and more
powerful telescopes. Some telescopes are housed in large **observatories**
on Earth. Often, these **observatories** are on the top of mountains, far
away from any cities or lights. This allows astronomers to clearly see
the stars and planets.

Other telescopes are **launched** into space using rockets. They
travel far above Earth and have a better view of the universe than
telescopes on Earth. One of these telescopes is the **Hubble Telescope** .
It was launched in 1990 by **NASA**, the American group of scientists
who study outer space. The **Hubble Telescope** is still in space today,
orbiting Earth. Since its **launch**, it has sent back thousands of photos
to **NASA** . **Hubble’s** photos have led to many new discoveries about
the universe. For example, using photos from **Hubble**, scientists now
think that the universe is about 13 to 14 billion years old!

Besides sending telescopes into space, **NASA** has also launched
rocket ships into space. Scientists believed it was too dangerous for

Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **95**


humans to ride the first rocket ships into space. They did not know
what effects space travel might have on humans. So, **NASA** first
sent apes into space on rocket ships. “Why apes?” you might ask.
Think back to what you learned in a previous reader about animals.
Apes are mammals and belong to same group of animals, called
primates, as humans. By studying the apes, scientists hoped to learn
how space travel might affect humans. In 1961, **NASA** sent the first
American **astronaut** into space on a rocket ship. His name was
Alan Shepard. He stayed in space for only 15 minutes.

After 1961, **NASA** sent more **manned** flights into space. These
flights orbited Earth but did not stop or land anywhere in space.
Then, in 1969, the United States sent a rocket ship to the moon.
The rocket ship was called **Apollo 11** .

Have you ever tried to throw a ball up in the air? The ball goes
up at first. Then, it comes back down. No matter how hard you
throw it, it comes back down because of **gravity** . **Gravity** is a force
of **attraction** that pulls things toward one another. Earth’s **gravity**
pulls the ball back down to Earth.

Earth’s **gravity** is a challenge for rocket ships like **Apollo 11** .
In order to fly off into outer space, the rocket ship has to push up
with a lot of force. It has to push up with so much force that **gravity**
cannot pull it back down.

**Apollo 11** fired a lot of strong rockets. It lifted off and went up
slowly at first. Then, it got faster and faster. This is what it looked
like after a few seconds. After just a few seconds more, it shot up
out of Earth’s atmosphere and into outer space.

**“Gravity”**


What exactly holds all of this stuff together in this huge universe?
Why don’t all these stars and planets just go flying off in any direction all
over the universe? Why do they stick together in groups and clusters like
solar systems and galaxies? These are excellent questions, and the answer
is . . . **gravity** !

**Gravity** is an invisible **force** of attraction between objects. It’s the **force**
that holds galaxies and solar systems together. It’s the **force** that keeps us
firmly planted on planet Earth instead of flying off into space. It’s the **force**
that keeps Earth orbiting around the sun and keeps the moon orbiting
around Earth. You can’t see **gravity** or touch it, but **gravity** is present
between everything in the universe that has mass. Because of **gravity**, every
single bit of **matter** in the universe pulls on every other piece of **matter** in
the universe.


You and I exert a pull on each other, but because we have very little mass
in our bodies compared to celestial bodies, our **gravitational pull** on each
other is very small—so small we can’t feel it at all.

**Gravity** depends greatly on mass . . . so what exactly is mass? Mass is
just the amount of **matter** in an object. You and I are small compared to,
say, a planet, or a star. We’re made of less “stuff,” so our mass is much, much
smaller. Mass is important when you are trying to understand **gravity,**
because the larger the mass, the larger the **gravitational pull** . So objects
with really large masses, like stars and planets, have a really big **gravitational**
**pull** on other objects. And objects with really small masses, like you or me,


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **97**


have really small gravitational pulls on other objects—so small we don’t
even notice the pull at all. The more mass an object has, the more **gravity**,
or pull, it is capable of. Because Earth has so much mass compared to all of
the things that are on the surface of the Earth, its surface **gravity** keeps the
things on Earth from flying off into space. You, your house, your bed, a ball
you throw up into the air—all of these things stay on Earth due to **gravity** !
Even the Earth’s atmosphere and the oxygen we breathe are held close to
Earth by its **gravitational pull** !

**Gravity** also causes you to have weight when you stand on a scale! Earth’s
**gravity** pulls down on you. The more mass you have, the harder the pull,
and the higher the numbers on the scale. Think about an astronaut who
is standing on the moon. The astronaut stays on the surface of the moon
because of the moon’s **gravity** . If the astronaut stood on a scale on the moon,
the astronaut’s weight would be six times less than the weight of the same
astronaut on a scale on Earth! So, a person who weighs sixty pounds on Earth
would weigh only ten pounds on the moon—about the weight of a bag of
flour—because the moon has less mass than Earth, and its **force** of **gravity** is
not as strong.


But the astronaut does not get pulled off the moon and back through
space to Earth! Earth still has a larger mass than the moon, and it still has
a larger **gravitational pull** than the moon. But because the astronaut is far
away from Earth and very close to the moon, the **gravitational pull** of the
moon has the most effect. It keeps the astronaut on the moon.

That’s another important thing to know about **gravity** —the distance
between two objects affects the **gravitational pull** between them. Objects that
are close to each other pull harder than objects that are farther away. The effect


**98** **Unit 6 |** Activity Book Grade 3


**NAME:** ACTIVITY PAGE
#### **11.1**

CONTINUED
**DATE:**


of an object’s **gravitational pull** lessens as you get farther away from it. The
sun has a lot more mass than Earth does. But the sun is also a lot farther away,
and because we are on the surface of Earth, Earth’s **gravity** has a much bigger
effect on us, keeping us firmly on Earth—one of the many benefits of **gravity** !


The sun contains ninety-nine percent of all the mass in our solar system.
Because the sun has more mass by far than anything else in the solar system,
it also has more **gravity** than anything else in the solar system. The sun’s
**gravity** —or **force** of attraction—is so strong that it constantly pulls the
planets toward it.


You may be wondering why the planets don’t crash into the sun if the sun
is pulling on them. Don’t worry; that never happens because the planets are
also moving really fast in their own orbits around the sun.

The combination of the planets’ own speed and the sun’s **gravitational**
**pull** toward it is what keeps the planets constantly circling in orbit around
the sun. It’s a perfect balance—the planets continue in their predictable
movements around the sun.

Sometimes **gravity** is so powerful that a **black hole** is formed: an object
or area with an extremely strong **gravitational pull** . There are many **black**
**holes** in space, and a **black hole’s gravity** is so strong that once something
gets close enough, nothing can escape its **gravitational pull** —not even light!
Astronomers find **black holes** in space by noticing the movement of objects
around them. You can’t see **gravity**, but you can observe the way the **force**
of **gravity** affects objects. Scientists are still learning about **black holes**, like
many other things in outer space.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **99**


On a clear night we can often see the moon moving across our
night sky. Have you ever been curious about why Earth has a moon?
Many scientists think that about four and a half billion years ago there
was a massive collision between Earth and a very large asteroid. The
information they have gathered shows that the moon may have formed
from the leftover debris from this amazing impact. Earth’s **gravity** was
able to hold the moon in its orbit. There is a strong **gravitational pull**
between Earth and the moon. The moon’s **gravity** pulls on all of the things
on the Earth—including people! But the Earth’s **gravity** is strong enough
to keep us on Earth.

The moon’s **gravity** also pulls on Earth’s oceans, but the Earth’s **gravity**
pulls back—and it’s a good thing it’s stronger! The moon’s **gravity** is just
strong enough that it can move the water on Earth enough to cause **tides** in
the oceans. **Tides** cause the regular rise and fall of the ocean’s waters. People
can see the effects of **tides** if they are at the seashore.

High **tides** cause the waves to come high up on the beach, and when low
**tides** occur, the waves don’t come up as far. Low **tide** is a good time to walk
the beach and look for shells and creatures that live in the sand.

So, yes, the powerful effects of **gravity** can explain a lot of interesting
things in the universe—it’s what holds our moon in orbit around Earth.
It’s what causes ocean **tides** on Earth day after day. **Gravity** is why we stay
on Earth and why objects we throw into the air come back down. **Gravity**
even helps create new stars and planets by helping pull together the gases
and dust that form them. We can’t see **gravity**, but we can see its effects all
around us—on Earth, in our solar system, and throughout our galaxy!

**Dear Family Members,**

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing the spellings of /ae/, /k/, /s/, /j/, and /n/ that
students have already learned. Your student will be assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _different_ and _thought_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. The Challenge Word _different_
does follow the spelling patterns for this week as the ‘n’ is pronounced /n/.

The Content Word for this week is _atmosphere_ . This word is directly related
to the material that we are reading in _What’s in Our Universe?_ The Content
Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student would
like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the test
for trying. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit and try to spell
this world.

**Nicolaus Copernicus**


1. How would you like to present the world with a new idea about how
something works? What if, besides being new, your idea was so different
from the ideas that people had believed for so long that people were opposed
to even listening to your ideas? That kind of fierce **opposition** is exactly what
a man named Nicolaus Copernicus experienced hundreds of years ago when
he had a new idea about astronomy.


Nicolaus Copernicus was a regular person, just like you. He was born
in Torun, Poland in 1473 and was raised by his uncle because both of
his parents died when he was about ten years old. Copernicus went to
universities in Poland and Italy and became a clergyman and doctor.


Copernicus studied many subjects, including math, philosophy, church
law, and medicine. But his favorite subject of all—and the thing that he had a
big new idea about—was astronomy.


As you have learned, astronomy is the study of the stars, space, and the
universe, and astronomers are scientists who study these amazing phenomena.
Long before Copernicus was born, the Greek philosopher Aristotle observed
that the sun appeared to “rise” in the east and “set” in the west. Because
Aristotle observed this **diurnal** motion of the sun with his own eyes, he—and
many others—believed that the Earth was stationary and that the sun and all of
the planets orbited around it. These observations and the strong belief in this
way of looking at the universe shaped people’s views for a very long time.


2. For more than one thousand years before Copernicus was born, most
astronomers and other people believed that the universe was **geocentric** . In


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **111**


other words, scientists thought that Earth was the center of the solar system
and the universe. They believed Earth stood still and the sun and all of the
planets and the moon circled around it, while the stars remained fixed in a
rotating sphere that was farther away.

You have heard that most people believed the **geocentric** theory of
the universe for more than one thousand years. Why? Because it was the
best explanation anyone had come up with for why the sun and planets
appeared to move the way they did. All of our observations were from
Earth. Remember, people did not have all of the scientific tools back then
that we have today, such as artificial satellites, spaceships, and high-powered
telescopes. These tools have greatly expanded modern understandings of
space through new opportunities for observation and gathering data. Think
about the difference between a person standing on Earth looking around and
a person in an airplane looking down on the Earth-bound person. The person
in the airplane can see a much wider scope of Earth. Powerful telescopes have
given us this new kind of perspective when we look up into space.


Most Greeks, including the famous philosopher Aristotle, believed
the **geocentric** theory. There were a few exceptions, such as the Greek

astronomer Aristarchus who, after much study, concluded that the sun
was much larger than Earth, and that it was Earth that moved around the
sun. His new idea, called a **hypothesis**, was never accepted by ancient
astronomers, but after many, many years, Aristarchus’s ideas greatly
influenced other astronomers in their studies.

3. Most ancient Romans believed the **geocentric** theory. During this time
it was the official position of the powerful Roman Catholic Church. Most
astronomers were afraid to question it or explore other **hypotheses,** though


**112** **Unit 6 |** Activity Book Grade 3


**NAME:** ACTIVITY PAGE
#### **13.1**

CONTINUED
**DATE:**


there were others before Copernicus who were trying to work out alternative
explanations. When Copernicus was born in 1473, almost everyone in
Europe believed in this **geocentric** theory, too. And almost everyone had no
idea that this view of the universe was about to change!


How could so many people have a completely different view of the
universe than we do today? The answer is easy. All of what we know about
the way the universe works—all of science—comes from the observations
and **logical** thinking of regular people, just like you and me. Astronomers
have always used scientific theories to explain the movement of the stars
and planets. Scientific theories aren’t necessarily complicated or hard to
understand—they are just possible explanations of how or why things
happen. But remember, scientific theories aren’t just guesses. They are ideas
that are based upon evidence and careful observation of the world—such as
observing where the stars appear in the sky every night.


Sometimes, however, what we think we are seeing is not what actually is,
such as the world looking flat but actually being round.


4. A long time ago stargazers spent a lot of time outside looking at the night
sky and noticed patterns in the sky. Early astronomers knew that the planets
had different movements than the stars which circled around Polaris once a
day. Astronomers observed that the planets moved slowly across the night
sky along a certain pathway. But people had also started noticing some odd
things about the motion of the planets as they followed this pathway. One of
these odd things was that sometimes Mars and other planets made a strange
backward loop in the sky. Scientists had tried to explain this motion using
the **geocentric** theory of the universe, but the explanations became pretty


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **113**


complicated. Still, most people didn’t question that Earth was the center of
the universe.


But Copernicus asked himself the question: if the planets were orbiting
around Earth, why would they follow such complicated patterns? He didn’t
think they would, and so he used his **logical** mind to come up with a
different scientific **hypothesis** that would better explain this strange looping
motion. Copernicus also had the work of Aristarchus long before to add to
his own studies. In science, often the work of one scientist is built upon the
work of the many scientists who have come before them.

5. What was the scientific **hypothesis** that Copernicus decided upon? It was
a **heliocentric hypothesis** of the universe. Does this idea sound familiar? This
was the **hypothesis** of Aristarchus more than one thousand years earlier! By
using mathematics to make careful **calculations** of the positions of the sun,
planets, and other celestial bodies, Nicolaus Copernicus came to the same
conclusion: that the sun was at the center of everything. He believed that
Earth orbited around the sun along with the rest of the planets. Copernicus
also **hypothesized** that the Earth is spinning and rotates on its own axis.


Of course, we now know that the Earth does rotate on its own axis.
And we also know that although the sun isn’t the center of the universe, it
is the center of our solar system. So, the **heliocentric** scientific **hypothesis**
Copernicus presented in the 1500s (that was built upon the scientific
**hypothesis** Aristarchus had presented more than one thousand years earlier)
was much closer to the truth than the **geocentric** theory that had been held
for so many years.

Unfortunately, similar to Aristarchus, Copernicus’s **hypothesis** was not
widely accepted by people during his lifetime. For one thing, people thought


**114** **Unit 6 |** Activity Book Grade 3


**NAME:** ACTIVITY PAGE
#### **13.1**

CONTINUED
**DATE:**


that if the Earth was spinning, all the things on it would be thrown off the
Earth and into space. They didn’t understand that the force of gravity holds
us firmly on Earth! Another part of the reason for this is that Copernicus’s
ideas were not published until literally the day he died.

But another part of the reason that the **heliocentric hypothesis** was not
widely accepted was that Copernicus’s ideas challenged the belief held by
most people that humans were at the center of the universe. This was very
difficult for many people to accept, so change came slowly. Still, as with
the studies of Aristarchus, the studies of Copernicus greatly influenced the
astronomers who came after him, including the great Italian astronomer
Galileo Galilei.


6. Galileo was inspired by the work of Copernicus and became one of the
first astronomers to build and use a telescope to study space in more detail.
As you heard earlier, Galileo discovered four of Jupiter’s moons. He observed
that the moons orbit Jupiter instead of Earth. His discoveries provided
further evidence that Aristarchus and Copernicus were—although in the
great minority—correct in their **heliocentric** theories!


Nicolaus Copernicus had made careful observations of the stars and
other celestial bodies. He recorded these observations with great attention.
But it was his willingness to ask questions—even when unpopular—that led
him to a clearer answer. Each time you ask questions to help understand
something better, you are following in the footsteps of the great astronomer
Nicolaus Copernicus. Asking questions to get closer to the truth is what the
scientific process is all about. Copernicus’s questioning mind and careful
observations led him to a new **hypothesis** about the arrangement of what


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **115**


we now know as the solar system. Though people were slow to accept his
**hypothesis**, the astronomers who followed Copernicus gathered more and
more evidence, so that today the **heliocentric** view is the accepted theory. It’s
important to remember that new information and evidence often change our
views about the world!

**Nicolaus Copernicus**


Do you remember in the very first chapter of this reader you learned that
long ago, people believed that the sun moved around Earth? This seemed
to make sense. Each morning at the start of the day, the sun rose in the east.
At the end of the day, the sun set in the west—exactly opposite from where
it had come up. To explain this change, people said the sun moved around
Earth. This is what the Greeks and other ancient people believed. But you
also learned in the first chapter that this was not true.


About the same time that Christopher Columbus landed in America, a man
named Nicolaus Copernicus was studying math and astronomy at a university
in Poland. He later moved to Italy where he also studied medicine and law.


But Copernicus’ real love was astronomy. He knew that since ancient
times, people believed that the sun moved around Earth. Copernicus began
to carefully observe and record the movement of the sun, planets, and stars.
After much research, Copernicus decided that the belief that the sun moved
around Earth could not be true. Copernicus’ observations led him to believe
just the opposite! He realized that instead, Earth was moving around the
sun! He also believed that as Earth orbited the sun, it also completed a full
rotation each day.


All of Copernicus’ ideas came from viewing space without the help of
a telescope. He wrote down what he observed from a cathedral bell tower.
He also used math to help him prove his point. Finally, Copernicus wrote a
book explaining his new ideas about how the universe worked. His fellow
scientists went to work trying to prove him wrong, but they couldn’t. Most
were amazed by his discovery!

Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **127**


However, Copernicus’ ideas were different from what people had
believed for thousands of years. They believed that Earth and humans were
the center of the universe. Many of the teachings of the church at that time
were also based on this belief. Copernicus had dared to suggest that Earth
was not the center of the universe. Instead, he said, the sun was at the center!
Many in the church disagreed with Copernicus’ ideas and spoke out against
them. So, his beliefs were not widely accepted while he was alive.


In fact, even after Copernicus died, the church continued to argue
against the view that the sun was at the center of the universe. Some
scientists agreed with Copernicus’ ideas. Galileo agreed with Copernicus and
was punished and put in jail for a long time.


Today we know, of course, that Copernicus was right. It took great
**courage** to speak up and suggest an idea that was so different from what
people had always believed. But that is how science works. Even today,
scientists continue to learn new things about the universe, so our knowledge
is always changing and growing.

**The Space Shuttle**


Interest in manned space **exploration** soared after Apollo 11. Other
astronauts went to the moon. But scientists were also interested in exploring
other parts of space beyond the moon. It was very expensive and took a lot
of time to build and send spaceships into space. Do you remember that when
Apollo 11 returned from space, it landed in the sea? It was not able to land
safely on the ground, so this type of spacecraft always had to land in the sea.
Once it landed in the sea, this kind of spacecraft could not be used again.

In 1981, a **reusable** spacecraft, called a **space shuttle**, was built. It
was able to fly up into space and then zoom back down to Earth. When
it returned to Earth, the pilot was able to land the spacecraft on a runway
almost like an airplane. It glided down from space and landed on a runway,
but it had to be a very long runway.

The **space shuttle** was flown back into space again and again. It
**shuttled** back and forth between Earth and space. That is why it was called
the **space shuttle** .

The image on the previous page shows the launch of a **space shuttle** .
The **space shuttle** itself is the white part that looks like a jet plane. The other
parts are **booster rockets** . The **booster rockets** helped the **space shuttle** get
off the ground. They helped the **space shuttle** overcome Earth’s gravity. Once
the **space shuttle** was up into space, it dropped the **booster rockets** because
it no longer needed them.

In the thirty years between 1981 and 2011, different **space shuttles**
carried astronauts up into space on many missions. The **space shuttle** was


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **135**


also used to bring **research** equipment and tools into space. The astronauts
did many experiments to find out more about space. Scientists were
**especially** interested in learning about what effect the lack of gravity would
have on humans and other living things.

The **space shuttle** was also used to help build an amazing **space station** .
Astronauts could live at the **space station** for months at a time. Often,
the **space shuttle** carried supplies back and forth from Earth to the **space**
**station** . It also provided a ride home to Earth when it was time for the
astronauts to return.

The last **space shuttle** mission took place in July 2011. NASA scientists
and Americans were proud of everything the astronauts had accomplished in
thirty years. With the end of the **space shuttle** missions, NASA is planning
other ways to explore space. Those plans include launching **unmanned**
probes and **satellites** . NASA scientists hope to learn more about the moon’s
gravity and are even talking about trying to explore asteroids!

**Dr. Mae Jemison**


Do you know what a role model is? A role model is someone who sets an
example for others by the way they live. Many students admire people who
are famous athletes, movie stars, or singers and use them as role models.
They see them on TV, in newspapers and magazines, and decide they want to
be like them. But some of the best role models are people that you probably
would not see on TV or in newspapers. They have jobs such as doctors,
teachers, or police officers. Some are scientists and astronauts. One such
person is Mae Jemison.


Mae Jemison was born October 17, 1956, in Decatur, Alabama. Her family
moved to Chicago, Illinois when she was young. Mae always took great pride
in her schoolwork. She was interested in science, but was also interested in the
arts. She finished high school early at age 16! From there, she went to Stanford
University in California. Most college students focus on only one topic of
study because college is so challenging. Mae focused on and excelled in two
topics of study— **chemical engineering** and **African-American studies** !


After Stanford, Mae entered medical school to become a doctor. She
wanted to use her medical training to help people in different countries on
the continent of Africa. To do this, she joined the **Peace Corps** as a volunteer.
As part of the Peace Corps, Mae treated patients and also helped train other
**health care** workers. She worked hard to help improve health care in the
countries where she worked.

After the **Peace Corps**, Mae came back to the United States. She set her
sights on a different goal. Her greatest dream was to become an **astronaut** and


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **141**


travel into space. She decided to apply to **NASA** to become an **astronaut** . But
the first time she applied, she was not accepted. Instead of giving up, she tried
again and NASA accepted her the second time! She was one of only 15 people
chosen from a group of 2,000 people who wanted to become **astronauts** !

Her training to become an **astronaut** was hard. She had to get into great
shape and train to get used to being free of the effects of **gravity** in space.
She also had to study and pass many tests about space travel. Mae Jemison
succeeded in both.

In 1992, Mae was chosen for a mission on the _**Endeavour**_ **space shuttle** .
A rocket **launched** the _**Endeavour**_ into orbit around Earth. Mae became the
first African-American female **astronaut** in space!

The mission was to study the effects of **weightlessness** on plants and
animals. Mae conducted experiments during the mission with fellow
**astronaut** Jan Davis. They collected information that the scientists at **NASA**
could study. The mission was a great success.

After her successful mission, Mae retired from **NASA** . She became a
professor at Dartmouth College, sharing her love of science and space with

other students. She also started her own company called The Jemison Group,
Inc. Mae’s company searches for ways that science can help improve the lives
of people in countries around the world. Mae Jemison is truly a role model
that we can all admire!

**What is NASA?**


The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created in
1958. Do you know what NASA does? NASA’s mission is to explore the universe
and share what they discover with the rest of the world. They also study weather
and create technology like telescopes, satellites, and airplanes. Scientists use the
information they receive from these devices to study other planets, track comets
and asteroids, and discover new stars, planets, and galaxies.

Two telescopes that you might be familiar with are the Hubble Telescope
and the James Webb Space Telescope. Both of these devices have traveled to
every planet in the solar system and many of their moons. Because of these
devices and others like them, scientists are able to study other planets’ climates,
the orbits of different space objects, and galaxies outside of our solar system.

To do all of this work, NASA has over 17,000 people working for
them across all fifty states. That is a lot of people! It’s not just astronauts
and engineers that work for NASA though. NASA has lawyers, secretaries,
photographers, writers, accountants, and more who all work together to help
achieve NASA’s mission. Of course, the most well known job at NASA is an
astronaut, but they are a very small group compared to everyone else at NASA.
Have you ever wondered what it takes to become an astronaut?


**How to Become an Astronaut**


Each year, thousands of people apply to become an astronaut. This is a
very risky job. The people who become astronauts have to be prepared for
anything as they travel into space! For example, there is no atmosphere in
space. Earth’s atmosphere protects us from harmful radiation from the sun
and keeps the planet warm. In space, astronauts do not have an atmosphere
to protect them from the sun’s radiation and extreme heat. This is an
environment that is completely different from life on Earth.

Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **149**


**Step 1:** Be a U.S. citizen.

**Step 2:** Study hard and earn good grades in school and complete the
requirements for a high school diploma, a bachelor’s degree, and a master’s degree.

The master’s degree must be in a STEM field like mathematics or
computer science.

**Step 3:** Pass a physical fitness test created just for NASA astronauts.

Only a few people are chosen to be astronauts. Those who are chosen will
spend the next two years learning important skills like spacewalking, working
on the space station, flying a jet, and using different robotic tools. Remember
that astronauts experience only a tiny amount of gravity in space. In order to
learn how to do their jobs, a lot of the training happens underwater! Being
underwater makes them feel weightless. This is how astronauts will feel during
their time on the International Space Station.This is how they will feel in
space. The underwater training ensures they are confident in their ability to
perform their jobs in the new environment.


**Space Exploration**


NASA sent astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon in
1969. Since then, NASA has sent astronauts to the International Space Station
and launched satellites and telescopes far into space. The first spacecraft to
reach Mars was the Viking I in 1975. Its job was to observe the landscape of
Mars and search for signs of life. It took pictures and a sample of Mars’s soil.
The pictures and soil sample showed scientists that Mars is a very cold planet
with a carbon dioxide atmosphere. The Curiosity Rover landed on Mars in
2012. This spacecraft traveled across Mars’s landscape and sent images and
videos back to Earth. The Dawn spacecraft spent a year orbiting a dwarf
planet between Mars and Jupiter in 2015. The Perseverance Rover landed on
Mars in 2020. It gave scientists even more information about the red planet.
It has taken over 500,000 images and collected samples of Mars’s core and
atmosphere. NASA continues to work to create better technology to send
more astronauts into space and to study Earth, the solar system, and beyond.

**Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center**


In 1961, the Manned Spacecraft Center was established in Houston,
Texas, as one of NASA’s training centers. Every NASA astronaut and
international space explorer who has traveled to the International Space
Station has trained here. In 1973, the center was renamed after President
Lyndon B. Johnson, becoming the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The
Johnson Space Center (JSC) is also home to NASA’s Mission Control Center.
Mission Control is made up of a team of engineers, technicians, and medical
officers who monitor the International Space Station’s crew and any other
astronaut or spacecraft during their missions into space. They are able to
provide help if the crew needs it, and they are available twenty-four hours a
day, seven days a week.


**“Houston, We Have a Problem!”**


You’ve probably heard the phrase, “Houston, we have a problem!” This
saying comes from an astronaut on the Apollo 13 mission in 1970 when there
was an explosion onboard and the astronauts needed Mission Control to help
them from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. NASA engineers and
scientists not only build training programs that help astronauts prepare for
working in space before their missions but are also able to help astronauts in
space directly from Earth.


**Training Facilities**


There are many different buildings that have been created at the Johnson
Space Center to train astronauts. For example, astronauts traveling into space
have to complete courses in the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility where they
learn to operate the International Space Station. The world’s largest indoor


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **153**


pool is also here. Astronauts use it to learn to walk in space. The pool is 40 feet
deep, and it holds over 6 million gallons of water! There are also labs for JSC
scientists to study the different samples and images sent back from space by
astronauts and spacecraft (e.g., rovers, satellites, telescopes). You will spend a lot
of time at JSC before your space mission if you are chosen as an astronaut.


**Visiting Houston**


It’s not only astronaut training that happens at JSC. You can visit the
Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center! Visitors can take tours and see different
spacecraft like the Gemini V spacecraft and the Apollo 17 Command Module.
There are NASA equipment, astronaut suits, and samples taken from the
moon on display. Scientists have also created a Mars exhibit where visitors
can touch a real Mars rock, view photos, and learn about the technology that
might possibly send humans to Mars one day!

**John F. Kennedy Space Center**


Have you wondered where most rockets and spaceships launch from?
Today, most launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral,
Florida. Over 130 space missions have been launched since the center opened.
In 2022, a record fifty-seven missions were launched! The original name of the
space center was the Cape Canaveral Space Center. In 1963, it was renamed to
the John F. Kennedy Space Center after President John F. Kennedy. President
Kennedy was a big supporter of Americans traveling to the moon. He set a
goal for Americans to land on the moon by 1970. This goal was met in 1969
with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s successful mission and “moon walk.”

After astronauts complete their training at the Johnson Space Center and
are chosen for a mission, they travel to the Kennedy Space Center. They stay in
dormitories, which are similar to hotel rooms, until they are ready to “suit up” for
the trip. There are over 700 buildings at the Space Center, including the Vehicle
Assembly Building where NASA’s tallest rockets are assembled and stored!


**Science + History**


While the Kennedy Space Center is NASA’s main launch zone, there are
also many scientific studies and experiments happening daily. Scientists and
engineers working here study and build structures they believe could help
people to one day live on other planets or moons in our solar system, like our
moon or Mars. It’s not only scientific studies that happen at the Kennedy
Space Center. One of the buildings has a huge library and archive section
containing film, photographs, planning documents, and other important
information about the different launches and studies at the center.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **157**


**Visiting Cape Canaveral**


If you are interested in learning more about the Kennedy Space Center,
you can visit. Visitors can spend hours at the Kennedy Space Center exploring
the different exhibits and two IMAX movie theaters. There are lots of different
artifacts to look at that astronauts and spacecraft have brought back to Earth
from their times in space. Visitors can also choose to take a bus tour out to
Launch Complex 39 to see where spacecraft are launched into orbit. The
Apollo/Saturn V Center is also located here. Visitors can see a recreated version
of the Saturn V rocket and participate in a simulation of the environment
in the Apollo capsule. The Astronaut Hall of Fame and the Space Mirror
Memorial that honor astronauts throughout history are also located here.

**Animal Astronauts**


When you hear the word “astronaut,” you probably think about a human,
right? Did you know that dogs, fruit flies, scorpions, and even chimpanzees
have traveled to space? These animals have helped scientists learn about how
living in space affects animals and humans. Just like human astronauts, animals
like dogs and chimpanzees had to go through astronaut training. Sometimes
the animals flew in the spacecraft alone for short missions. Other times, they
were with human astronauts. Scientists were able to learn valuable information
about how space affects the physical characteristics of some animals.

Félicette, a French cat, became the only cat to travel into space in 1963.
Two garden spiders were sent into space in 1973. Scientists studied how
their webs were affected by the tiny amount of gravity in space. They learned
that spiders are able to weave thicker webs in space than on Earth! Over six
hundred ants traveled to the International Space Station in 2015. They went
so students could study how different groups of ants searched for food in a
new environment. The ants were nicknamed “ant-ronauts.” These animals
were not able to interact with the space vehicle or help the astronauts during
the missions. However, one animal did!

In 1961, a three-and-a-half-year-old chimpanzee named Ham traveled
into space.The trip lasted thirteen and a half minutes. It was remarkable!
Ham was trained to flip levers when buttons lit up. He was able to complete
his assigned tasks in the spacecraft. Ham’s ability to perform the tasks gave
confidence to human astronauts to travel into space. Ham retired from NASA
two years later. He spent the next seventeen years of his life living in the
National Zoo in Washington, D.C.

**A Dog in Space**


A dog named Laika became the first animal to orbit the Earth in 1957!
Laika was born in Russia and was living on the streets of Moscow before
being rescued and chosen to travel into space on the Sputnik 2 spacecraft.
Just like human astronauts, Laika had to train before traveling into space. Her
training was different from human astronauts though. Laika had to get used
to remaining still and calm for long periods of time because the spacecraft was
very small. She also had to become comfortable with wearing a harness and
gear that would monitor her vital signs such as her heart rate and temperature.
Laika was successful in her training. The Sputnik 2 launched Laika into space
on November 3, 1957. It carried her around the world in about 103 minutes.


**Laika’s Legacy**


A statue of Laika was created to celebrate and remember her at Star
City. This is the training facility of Russian cosmonauts (the Russian term
for astronauts). Laika is shown with fellow astronauts to remember the first
animal sent into orbit. Another statue was created in 2008 where Laika
completed her training. This time she is sitting on top of a spacecraft. Laika’s
story has also inspired several books and films. Laika is remembered as a brave
dog who made it possible for other animals to travel into space.

**Space Explorers**


Astronaut comes from two Greek words that together mean “star sailor,”
which is how NASA describes the people who have traveled into space. It is
very difficult to become an astronaut. In 2021, over 12,000 people applied
to NASA. Only ten people were chosen. There are currently forty-one active
astronauts. This means those forty-one people are able to travel into space.
There are many other astronauts who are not active and are either working in
different positions at NASA or training for future missions. At this time, over
600 people have been trained as astronauts, and these brave people help widen
our understanding of the Earth, its weather and climate, and our solar system.


**Stephanie Wilson**


Stephanie Wilson became an astronaut in 1996 and completed her
training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. She has completed
three spaceflights and spent more than forty-two days in outer space. Her
training as a mission specialist is especially important, as Wilson is skilled
in robotics and controls the robotic arms of the spacecraft during missions.
During her missions, she has tested new equipment and safety features and
delivered important parts to the International Space Station.

Wilson’s accomplishments do not stop there. She also served as the lead
CAPCOM, or capsule communicator, during the all-female space walk in
2019. In addition, Wilson was awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal three
times, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal twice, and the Johnson Space
Center Director Commendation Award. Wilson is the second Black woman to
travel into space.

**Dr. Ellen Ochoa**


Dr. Ellen Ochoa began her career at NASA as a research engineer. She
was chosen as an astronaut in 1980 and completed her training at the Johnson
Space Center. Dr. Ochoa is the first Hispanic woman to travel to space. Later,
she became the eleventh director of the Johnson Space Center. This makes her
the first Hispanic director and the second female director of the Johnson Space
Center. She has flown in four missions and spent 1,000 hours in orbit. While
in space, she studied the sun, Earth’s atmosphere, and the ozone layer, and she
also helped to resupply the International Space Station. She was on the first
mission where a spacecraft landed on the International Space Station!

Ochoa is also a highly decorated veteran astronaut. She was awarded the
Distinguished Service Medal in 2015.This is the highest award NASA gives.
She has received the NASA Space Flight Medal four times. She was inducted
into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2017.


**Victor J. Glover**


Victor J. Glover became an astronaut in 2013. Before becoming an
astronaut, Glover served in the U.S. Navy as a naval aviator and test pilot. He
has spent over 3,000 hours in flight in more than forty different types of aircraft!
He completed his astronaut training in 2015 at Johnson Space Center, and since
then, he has spent 168 days in space. While in space, he also participated in four
space walks. In 2020, Glover’s first mission was on the Crew Dragon Resilience
spacecraft. This was the second manned space mission launched since 2011,
and Glover served as the pilot. During his missions, Glover worked to repair the
power and scientific systems on the International Space Station.

Glover has received many awards and distinctions for his service in the
Navy. He has also been awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and
the NASA Space Exploration Medal. Most recently, Glover was chosen to
serve as pilot on the upcoming Artemis 2 mission. This mission will take four
astronauts to the moon. This will be his second spaceflight, but it is clear he
has a promising future ahead of him at NASA.
