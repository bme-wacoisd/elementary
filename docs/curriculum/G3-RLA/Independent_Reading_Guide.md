Independent Reading with
Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts


_“Reading should not be presented to_

_children as a chore, a duty. It should be_

_offered as a gift.”_


_— Kate DiCamillo_


_“Many of the things we need can wait. The_

_child cannot. Right now is the time his bones_

_are being formed, his blood is being made,_

_and his senses are being developed. To him we_

_cannot answer ‘Tomorrow,’ his name is today.”_


_—Gabriela Mistral_


_“So it is with children who learn to read_

_fluently and well: They begin to take flight_

_into whole new worlds as effortlessly as_

_young birds take to the sky.”_


_—William James_

#### Introduction

The Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts Independent Reading Guide is designed
to develop and enhance students’ reading experiences and abilities. The program aims to
promote and instill a love of reading. Exposure to a wide variety of books will improve reading
fluency, vocabulary acquisition, and comprehension skills. Reading widely will develop criticalthinking skills and enable students to acquire a greater understanding of the world in which
they live.


 - The Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts Independent Reading Guide encourages and

enables students to:


    - Read chapter books, picture books, informational text, and literature, including fiction, poetry, and
plays.


    - Self-select books of personal interest.


    - Become engaged learners who read and engage with books independently for a sustained
period of time.


    - Develop keen critical-thinking skills.


    - Become independent thinkers and lifelong readers.


    - Explore and understand the power of language.


    - Develop fluency, including rate, accuracy, and prosody, when reading text orally.


    - Foster the joy of reading.


    - Celebrate reading achievements.


In addition, the Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts Independent Reading Guide is

aligned to Grades K–5 Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills standards for English Language Arts

and Reading, with specific focus on supporting students to read grade- and language proficiency
appropriate texts with independence.

#### Step into Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts Independent Reading

~~**KINDERGARTEN–GRADE 2: GROWING AND LEARNING**~~


In the early grades, Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts instructional materials focus

on vocabulary and listening comprehension development through carefully sequenced, content-rich

Read-Alouds as well as systematic instruction in reading and writing skills.


~~**GRADES 3–5: INDEPENDENTLY ENGAGING WITH COMPLEX TEXTS**~~


In later grades, the instructional materials continue to advance students’ knowledge and vocabulary

through Read-Alouds and in-depth discussions, while also immersing students in complex texts and

advanced writing assignments that draw on the academic content they have been engaged in since

preschool. Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts Grades 3–5 instructional materials

combine features of both strands and further develop good reading practices and habits, including the

promotion of independent reading.


Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts Independent Reading gives students the opportunity

to select books of their choice, including books that may enhance or expand upon what they have

learned in Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts units.


~~**INTRODUCING INDEPENDENT READING**~~


Because words give form to our thoughts, dreams, and concerns, reading is, without a doubt,

an essential form of engagement. As a result of the knowledge we gain through reading, we are more

able to interact, understand, and contribute to the world in which we live. And, as a result of reading

widely, we develop a greater understanding of our shared experiences. Reading develops empathy,

curiosity, and a sense of belonging.


It enables us to become better citizens; however, in order to become successful and engaged

independent readers, students need tools to evaluate and select texts on their own. They will learn

to select reading material based on their interest and the text’s content. They will become decision
makers, and in doing so, they will help guide their own educational progress.


Through independent reading, students are encouraged to set off on a journey of exploration into the

pages of books that may transport them to a bustling foreign city, a rainforest, or a faraway land full of

magic and mystery. And, like true adventurers and seekers of knowledge, the students are in charge of

their own journey.



**5**


To support students as they grow as readers, the materials in this guide are presented in three

developmental tiers: early and emergent readers (Grades K–1), developing readers (Grades 2–3), and

independent readers (Grades 4–5). While many students will be ready to use the materials during the

suggested grades, this may not be the case for all students. Teachers are encouraged to provide materials

that support a student’s reading developmental stage over the student’s grade level placement.


For additional guidance in supporting all learners, see the User Guide (available on the program’s

digital components site). This resource includes best practices and strategies that can be integrated

into your independent reading practice for English Language Learners, Gifted/Talented Students, Dual

Language Students, and students with disabilities.


~~**CONNECTING STUDENTS WITH BOOKS**~~


A key part of an independent reading program involves ensuring that students have access to a variety of

books. The following list includes suggestions for where students may select texts for independent reading.


- Student Reader

  - Many Student Readers include enrichment text selections that students may read independently.


- Classroom library

  - If you need additional text options in your classroom library, you may wish to acquire the
Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts’s Trade Book Guides (Grades K–2).


- School library

  - Consider scheduling a library session for your students to browse and select books they would
like to read independently. Your librarian may also be able to work with students who would like
personalized recommendations. This kind of session can offer an opportunity for library skills
sessions. For example, students may learn how to research books by a favorite author or on a
particular topic of interest.


- Local public library

  - Remind students that local libraries have different selections than the school library. Some
students may benefit from learning how to acquire a library card.


  - Many local libraries also host events and programs for students; you may wish to remind students
and their families about such events.


- Area bookstores

  - Students and their families may be unaware that many bookstores host events such as story
hours and author visits or book signings. These events are typically free and open to all.


  - Bookstores are also able to order books for purchase, so if students are looking for a text they
cannot locate elsewhere, the bookstore may be able to get it for them.


- Book swaps

  - One fun way to provide students with different reading options while also building a classroom
community is to host a classroom book swap. Students should each bring in a text they have



**6**


already read and would like to trade with a peer. Students can exchange books with one another.
After reading the book, students can exchange with new partners. You can repeat this process
throughout the year, allowing students to read multiple new texts.


  - After several students have read a particular book, you may wish to group them and facilitate
discussion or other activities around that book.


~~**COMMUNICATING EXPECTATIONS**~~


When introducing Independent Reading, explain to students the guidelines for your class. The

materials that follow offer a simple, step-by-step guide for implementing a successful independent

reading program, but you should customize the implementation to best suit your students’ needs.


Some options you may wish to consider including appear below.

- Explain that independent reading is an opportunity for them to freely, yet wisely, select and read

books that they find interesting.


- Identify a routine for independent reading, such as naming a designated time and place for regular

independent reading.


- Ask students to keep a log of the books they read.


- Ask students to conference with their teacher, a peer, or within a group.


- Challenge students to continue to read outside the classroom and to invite their parents, guardians,

siblings, and friends to participate in their reading experiences.


- Provide students opportunities to share with others their enjoyment and opinions of the books they

are reading.

Seven Steps to Implementing a Successful
Independent Reading Program


















**Step One:**
Create a Designated Time, Place, and
Routine for Independent Reading

It is essential to provide a time and place for students to explore a range of books freely and

independently. Therefore, regular exposure to books—to language, content, art, graphics, and the

other creative forces that enable us to communicate on many different levels—is the fundamental

goal of Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts Independent Reading. The cycle of reading,

learning, and sharing nurtures intellectual growth.








|Create a Designated Time, Place, and Routine for Independent Reading|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Time**|Recommended minimum: Twice a week for at least thirty minutes. However, teachers should<br>encourage independent reading whenever time allows (rainy days inside the classroom, frst<br>ten minutes of the school day, fve minutes after lunch, last ten minutes of the school day, etc.).<br>Emergent/early readers may use that time to browse picture books and explore the illustrations.|Recommended minimum: Twice a week for at least thirty minutes.

|**Place**|Consider whether students have an inviting space for reading. Is that space conducive to<br>reading quietly and thoughtfully? Does the space allow the reader to joyfully get “lost” in their<br>book? If students are not moving to a designated place, make sure there is clear instruction<br>that quiet reading time has begun at their desks. Ideally, students should have a comfortable<br>space that promotes reading for pleasure.|Consider whether students have an inviting space for reading.

**Note:** It is recommended that the reading materials available to students integrate relevant subject matter for the
given population. This encourages increased comprehension and engagement for students of various cultural and
linguistic backgrounds.



**9**


**Step Two:**
Monitor, Assess, and Encourage
Reading Experiences

The most important element of building a successful independent reading program is creating a

classroom culture that values and celebrates the joy of reading. Students who believe that their

excitement about books matters to their peers and to adults are more likely to read widely and

frequently. The following list includes ideas for promoting this kind of culture.


 - Ask students what they are reading for fun or on their own on a regular, even daily, basis.


 - Share your own reading experiences with students. You might casually mention a trip to the library

or describe (with age-appropriate language and context) a book you are reading. It is important for
students to see adult readers. Discuss with students how you establish a purpose for selecting a
particular book.


 - Share memories of your favorite childhood books. If possible, curate a selection of these for students

to read during independent reading time.


 - Invite guest readers to your classroom. These may be older students, teachers or other school

employees, parents, or community members. If possible, select a wide range of readers so that
students come to understand that people in all professions and walks of life enjoy reading. (Students
may expect the librarian to have a favorite book, but it might surprise them to learn that their physical
education coach has one, too!) These readers might read aloud to your class and also discuss a book
they loved reading as a student.


 - Host a classroom, grade-level, or school-wide character parade, in which students dress as their

favorite book character and parade together to celebrate their costumes. Alternatively, create a
character wall and allow students to draw their favorite book character.


 - Host a character conversation in which students work with partners or in small groups. Each student

should identify a favorite character, name the character’s book, and offer a brief description of the
character. Students should then have conversations with each other in the role of their characters.
Challenge students to think about what would happen if Harry Potter met Laura Ingalls Wilder, for
example, and then to use their conversations to explore the possibilities.


 - Have students give each other book recommendations. You may wish to provide sentence starters

or frames, such as “If you enjoyed, you would really like  .” or “I think you would enjoy
reading  .”


 - Partner with a teacher of older students to create year-long reading buddies. Each younger student

would have an older reading buddy (a student from the other class) who reads to them one-on-one.


 - Have students write letters to their favorite characters or authors.


 - If working with multilingual students, encourage them to read books from their home language(s).

|Monitor, Assess, and Encourage Reading Experiences|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Monitor and Assess**|•	 Set reading goals and provide strategies for helping students meet these<br>goals. For example, if a student’s goal is to read twenty-fve pages each week,<br>help them understand that they need to read fve pages per weekday to reach<br>their goal. Use Setting SMART Goals and Goal Guide (available in Additional<br>Resources) to support students.<br>•	 Whenever possible, allow students to set their own reading goals.<br>•	 Model the book selection process by discussing the process aloud.<br>•	 Create a chart for students to refer to as they select their books. For example,<br>you may wish to create recommendations based on if students want to learn<br>more about a particular unit or if they have some suggestions for additional<br>texts on that unit content.<br>•	 Track goals and progress on a regular basis, preferably when each student<br>completes a book. This will give them a sense of accomplishment and provide<br>evidence of their growth and development as a reader.|
|**Book Selection**|Students will, over time, be able to take full ownership of their book selections.<br>Initially, though, a certain degree of guidance may help students fnd success<br>and enjoyment.<br>Use reading conferences to understand students’ reactions to books they have<br>selected and read. If students did not enjoy a previous selection, consider how<br>they made their selection. Students, particularly those who are in younger grades<br>or who are new to independent reading, may need support making selections<br>they will enjoy reading. Work with students to establish a purpose for the text<br>they select. Ask if they want to be entertained when they read, or if they want to<br>learn about a specifc topic. Ask students Why they are reading a book and help<br>them pose this question of themselves. Remember, though, that the goal of an<br>independent reading program is to equip and empower students to make their<br>own choices. Any support should be helping students fnd texts that interest them<br>rather than dictating what they must read.|



**11**


**Step Three:**
Equip Students to Engage, Interact, Make
Good Choices, and Be Accountable

Independent reading is, for the most part, a solitary experience. However, the knowledge, inspiration,

and creative forces acquired as a result of reading can and should be shared. Therefore, provide

frequent times for students to share and discuss their thoughts about the books they read. Encourage

discussion and dialogue. These sharing experiences will provide students with the opportunity to

articulate their ideas and develop their critical-thinking skills.








|Equip Students to Engage, Interact, Make Good Choices, and Be Accountable|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Book Talks**|Book talks and sharing experiences give students the opportunity to develop their<br>critical-thinking skills, as well as a chance to share the knowledge they have gained.<br>Students can give book talks and share with a partner, a small group, or the whole class.<br>Students may also enjoy and gain motivation from sharing with external groups, such as<br>parents or other family members, an older reading buddy, a librarian, or others.|
|**Discussion**<br>**and Dialogue**|Discussion is a fun and interactive way for students to share and learn from each other.<br>Students can be placed in discussion groups based on varying criteria, including text<br>topic or theme, text genre, text format, or other factors. Students will beneft in working<br>with both heterogeneous and homogeneous groups throughout the year.<br>Older students may enjoy book discussions, which may take many forms. Students may<br>nominate books or characters, then engage in dialogue about which is best, funniest,<br>and so forth. Students may also discuss the merits of character decisions or behaviors,<br>incorporating textual evidence to support their ideas.|
|**Writing**|Writing is, of course, powerfully integrated with reading. Whenever possible, allow for<br>writing opportunities that connect with independent reading. Students may enjoy<br>writing letters to an author, journaling about what they have read, writing a book review,<br>composing a creative piece inspired by what they have read, or other such activities.|
|**Visuals**|Many visual activities and supports can help enliven works students have read; they can<br>also help students express what they have learned from a text. You may wish to create<br>book-related visuals or art to hang in the classroom. You may also wish to have students<br>illustrate a book they have read, design an alternative cover for the text, or create a<br>poster for a movie version of the text. Advanced students may enjoy drawing a character<br>or scene; they may also imagine what a setting for the text might look like and create a<br>drawing, painting, diorama, or other visual representation of that setting.|
|**Performing**|Whenever possible, bring words to life by encouraging students to perform dramas or<br>skits, recite poetry aloud, or use multimedia (such as audio or videos).|



**12**


**Step Four:**
Provide Regular Opportunities for
Conferencing and Interaction with Students

Strategic reflection develops students’ awareness of how they read and how they can improve upon

their reading experiences. Build in time for reflection through one-on-one conferencing. Encourage

them to maintain a reading log. (Several types of reading logs are provided in the Additional Resources

section of this guide.) Carefully crafted, reflective questions will focus students’ attention on how and

what they read. Continue to monitor their reading choices and outcomes.








|Early/Emergent|Developing|Independent|
|---|---|---|
|•	What kinds of books do<br>you like?<br>•	What are you looking at<br>now? Tell me about it.<br>•	What is your favorite<br>part of this book? What<br>is your least favorite<br>part? Why?|•	What kinds of books do<br>you enjoy reading?<br>•	Tell me about the<br>book you are currently<br>reading.<br>•	Who is your favorite<br>character? Why?|•	What are your favorite<br>genres or authors?<br>•	Summarize what has<br>happened in the plot of<br>your book so far.<br>•	What would you change<br>to make this book<br>(even) better?|




|Provide Regular Opportunities for Conferencing and Interaction with Students|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Conferencing**|Conferencing is an opportunity to inspire students as readers and to nurture their<br>exploration of ideas. It is also an opportunity to assess student progress. Offer pertinent<br>prompts and questions, such as:<br>**Early/Emergent**<br>**Developing**<br>**Independent**<br>•	What kinds of books do<br>you like?<br>•	What are you looking at<br>now? Tell me about it.<br>•	What is your favorite<br>part of this book? What<br>is your least favorite<br>part? Why?<br>•	What kinds of books do<br>you enjoy reading?<br>•	Tell me about the<br>book you are currently<br>reading.<br>•	Who is your favorite<br>character? Why?<br>•	What are your favorite<br>genres or authors?<br>•	Summarize what has<br>happened in the plot of<br>your book so far.<br>•	What would you change<br>to make this book<br>(even) better?<br>Help students explore the text more critically by providing open-ended questions.<br>(Samples are included in the back of this guide.)<br>Encourage students to brainstorm questions and to make connections across high-level<br>concepts for a deeper understanding of texts they have read.<br>**Note:**Translanguaging, or switching between languages, has been studied as<br>an effective instructional strategy for bilingual students. For emergent bilingual<br>students, discussing reading in their native language will assist in determining their<br>comprehension and creating engagement with independent reading.|
|**Reading**|Ask students to be aware of when, where, and how long they are reading. Encourage<br>them also to consider how their environment affects their reading experience.|



**13**


|Provide Regular Opportunities for Conferencing and Interaction with Students|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Setting Goals**|Work with students to set strategic goals. One example of a strategic goal is a SMART<br>goal: “I will read ten pages of_Today I Will Fly_ by Friday.”<br>SMART stands for:<br>•	 Specifc: Student has selected a specifc book,_Today I Will Fly._<br>•	 Measurable: Student will read ten pages.<br>•	 Achievable: Student has time to read ten pages by Friday.<br>•	 Relevant: Student enjoys Mo Willems’s books.<br>•	 Time-bound: Student will complete reading by Friday.<br>When students set SMART goals, they can track those goals and feel a sense of<br>accomplishment each time they achieve one.|
|**Progress Review**<br>**and Log**|Be sure to incorporate a review of reading progress during one-on-one conferencing<br>or at other times in the classroom. During this time, you may record progress, discuss<br>that progress with the student, and celebrate students’ reading successes. Use a reading<br>log (available in Additional Resources) to record students’ goals and conference notes,<br>and to allow students to think critically about book selection.|





|Early/Emergent|Developing|Independent|
|---|---|---|
|I will . . .<br>•	ask one question about the story<br>after listening,<br>•	use the pictures to tell three<br>things that happened in the<br>story, in order,<br>•	fnd three uppercase and three<br>lowercase letters I know in a<br>book,<br>•	make pictures in my mind while<br>listening, then draw three of<br>those pictures,<br>•	identify the parts of a book<br>(front cover, back cover, title<br>page).|I will . . .<br>•	sound out two new words with<br>silent letters while reading today,<br>•	make a connection from this<br>book to something we read in<br>class by the end of the week,<br>•	summarize my book, using<br>a three-to-fve-sentence<br>paragraph, the day after I fnish<br>reading it,<br>•	use context clues to fnd<br>the meaning of unfamiliar<br>vocabulary.<br>_Keep in mind that more than fve_<br>_unfamiliar words on a page may_<br>_mean the book is too challenging._|I will . . .<br>•	make a prediction about what<br>will happen in the plot after each<br>chapter,<br>•	fnd three sensory details in the<br>chapter I read today,<br>•	draw a movie poster for my book<br>using details from at least two of<br>my favorite parts of the story,<br>•	use context clues to fnd the<br>intended meaning of multiple<br>meaning vocabulary words.|


**Note:**








 - Developing and Independent readers will often benefit from SMART goals based on fluency. See the

Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts Fluency Packets for materials that support fluency goals.

 - Emergent bilingual students will benefit from more frequent conferences and short check-ins. Useful

conversations and goals for these students include using cognates and visuals to increase comprehension.



**14**


**Step Five:**
Maintain Regular Communications with
Parents, Guardians, and Other Adults
(Such as a Librarian)

It is essential to establish regular forms of communication with parents, guardians, and other

important family members. Consider sharing weekly updates on reading experiences, which could

take the form of a letter or newsletter or could consist of a student-produced item, such as a report on

the text they read in the previous week. Alternatively, students could take their individual reading logs

home for a family member to review. Send home a copy of Supporting Independent Reading at Home,

found in Additional Resources, to help families start conversations about reading at home.






|Maintain Regular Communications with Parents, Guardians, and Other Adults<br>(Such as a Librarian)|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Home Component**|The following suggestions help advise family members on how to create a<br>home environment that supports independent reading.<br>•	 Initiate frequent communication with parents and guardians<br>regarding the books students are reading, and include suggestions<br>for discussion topics at home. Weekly updates will provide a bridge<br>between home and classroom reading expectations and successes.<br>•	 Involve siblings and friends in students’ reading experiences.<br>•	 Encourage reading time outside the classroom, such as bedtime<br>stories and shared family reading time.<br>•	 Encourage students to discuss the books they are reading with<br>family members. Use the Supporting Independent Reading at Home<br>resource to provide developmentally appropriate questions to<br>families for discussion at home.|
|**Bridging the**<br>**In- and Out-of-Classroom**<br>**Reading Experiences**|Reading comes alive when students can apply the knowledge they acquire<br>to their everyday lives. Create opportunities for students to discuss their<br>independent reading experiences.<br>•	 Make time for students to discuss connections between the books<br>they are reading and their day-to-day lives.<br>•	 Make time for students to discuss the reading experiences they have<br>had outside the classroom.<br>•	 Provide time for students to discuss life experiences that might<br>connect with their in-school reading and learning experiences.|



**15**


**Step Six:**
Help Students Set Achievable Goals and
Monitor Outcomes

Help students establish clear and realistic expectations. For example, students may read a certain

number of pages per week, or they may select a date to complete a book review or give a book

talk. Continually invite them to discuss the books they are reading. Revise expectations based on

monitoring and assessments of reading progress.


|Help Students Set Achievable Goals and Monitor Outcomes|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Achievable Goals**|Each week, establish reading goals and expectations.<br>•	 Check in with students at the end of each independent reading block.<br>•	 Set reading targets (number of pages).<br>•	 Check reading logs and charts.<br>•	 Adjust goals and expectations according to students’ needs.<br>The developmental level of readers will determine how much assistance<br>they will need in developing their goals.<br>•	** Early/Emergent Readers:** Write goals together as a class or in small<br>groups. At the start of the school year, when routines are still being<br>established, the teacher may distribute reading logs with the goal<br>already flled in.<br>•	** Developing Readers:** Model and support students while they begin to<br>write their own goals. Provide sentence starters and other supports as<br>needed.<br>•	** Independent Readers:** Encourage students to take ownership of their<br>own goals. Use Setting SMART Goals and Goal Guide (available in<br>Additional Resources) to support students.|



**16**


**Step Seven:**
Celebrate Reading Achievements

Discuss books frequently. Select a book of the week to highlight and profile in the classroom.

Share examples of reading experiences and goals. Encourage students to speak, share, critique,

dramatize, and promote the books they are reading. Most of all, share the joy of reading

by celebrating students’ reading successes and experiences.

|Celebrate Reading Achievements|Col2|
|---|---|
|**The Joy of Reading**|Discuss books as often as possible. Begin or end each day with a fun fact about a<br>book, author, or other literary topic.<br>•	Read quotes or citations from classical texts.<br>•	Challenge students to memorize favorite age-appropriate lines or stanzas.<br>•	Share your favorite books, plays, or poems.<br>•	Introduce students to works by celebrated authors.|



**Engage at Launch**


The start of an independent reading period is a good time for the teacher to model their own joy of

reading. Keeping in mind the developmental level and personal interests of the students promotes

engagement as students begin their independent reading period.

**Note:** Integrate the use of texts with visuals that support comprehension and multilingual texts to

model for emergent bilingual students.


**Engage at Wrap-Up**


The closing of an independent reading session is ideal for students to share their own joy of
reading experiences. Encouraging students to talk about their own reading with their classmates
promotes a classroom environment that values and encourages the development of lifelong
readers.

## Additional Resources

The following materials are intended to support implementation of an independent reading program.

These Blackline Masters may be reproduced for students and family members.


Teachers may use these materials flexibly to support independent reading. Not all teachers will use all

materials. For example, different versions are provided for some student-facing materials; teachers

should select the form that best suits their students’ needs. It is acceptable to use different forms in

one classroom. For example, different reading logs may best suit students of various reading abilities.


Younger students may need adult support in completing materials such as the reading log. However,

teachers may instruct students to use drawings, check marks, or other similar notations as appropriate.

offer these additional enrichment activities for students to share or apply what they are learning.

Alternatively, students may complete these for enrichment at home.


**Fast Facts:** Have students make a poster sharing the five most important facts they learned from an

informational text.


**Graphic Novel:** Ask students to create a graphic novel version of a text they have read.


**Focus On:** Invite a group of students to orally present a short profile on a historical figure they have

read about.


**Creative Expression:** Ask students to write a creative text (e.g., a poem), based on the book, or a new

scene for a fictional work.

##### Setting SMART Goals


If you want to improve at something, it’s important to set goals. But not just
any goal will do—you want to set SMART goals! This kind of goal is called
SMART because the name reminds you what your goal should be like.


**S—** specific


      - Goals should name one thing you will do.


      - Sometimes if you have a really big idea, you might need to break it down

into pieces to develop SMART goals. For example, let’s say you want to get
better grades. That’s a good idea, but it’s not specific. You need to pick a
place to start, so you might set a SMART goal of learning all this week’s
spelling words.


      - Get better at school—not specific.


      - Learn all this week’s spelling words—specific.


**M—** measurable


      - This means you will be able to tell whether you succeed or not.


      - If your goal is to get better grades, how will you know if you met it? Do you

have to get better grades in every class, or just in one subject? Do you
mean on one test or on your overall report card?


      - Get better grades—not very measurable.


      - Get an A on the next spelling assessment—measurable.


**A—** achievable


      - Sometimes, you might really want to do something, so you break down a

task into small steps to achieve your goal. For example, you want to read
for a longer amount of time so you increase the number of minutes you
read each day until you achieve your goal.


**36**


  - Improve your reading time by increasing the number of minutes you read

each day—achievable.


**R—** relevant


  - This means your goal is connected to something you want. For example, if

you want to make better grades, your goal should relate to that somehow.
It wouldn’t make sense to set a goal such as “learn to sing” unless you
are taking a music class! A better goal might be to get an A on the next
spelling assessment.


  - Learn to sing—not relevant to getting better grades.


  - Get an A on the next spelling assessment—relevant to getting better

grades.


**T—** time-bound


  - This means that your goal is something you will accomplish by a certain

date or benchmark. You know when you will do it.


  - Get an A in spelling—not clearly time-bound.


  - Get an A on the next spelling assessment—time-bound.


Now that you know how to set SMART goals, you can use the Goal Guide to
set goals for yourself. Good luck—you’ve got this!

###### Supporting Independent Reading at Home


Family members who would like to support a student’s independent reading can consider the

following strategies.


 - Read to your student or listen to your student reading aloud.


 - Read or listen to your student read in your home language. This will also help your student develop

language skills that speed up learning new English language skills.


 - Take your student to the public library for a wide range of books to read and explore. In addition,

many libraries offer free children’s educational programs, such as story time, reading hours, or author
visits; such events help promote a love of reading.


 - Make reading part of your daily home routine. You may wish to let your student read for a set amount

of time during the day. Another option is to have a family reading time in which all family members
read in English and/or in their home language. When adults model a love of reading, it often rubs off
on children!


**Note:** In determining a reading routine, consider how to establish a time that will not be interrupted or
overlooked. For example, many parents report that reading before bedtime often gets rushed or skipped at the
end of a busy day, when children may be overtired or well past their bedtime. They have found more success by
establishing a reading time earlier in the day—and then if their children also read at night, all the better.


 - Ask your student detailed questions about what they have read.








|Early/Emergent Readers|Developing Readers|Independent Readers|
|---|---|---|
|•	What was the story about?<br>•	What was your favorite part?<br>Why?<br>•	Who were the characters in the<br>book?<br>•	What did you learn about in this<br>book? (nonfction)|•	What happened in the story?<br>•	What kind of story was it? Funny?<br>Scary? Sad?<br>•	Who was your favorite/least<br>favorite character? Why?<br>•	What did you learn about in this<br>book? (nonfction)|•	What was the plot of the story?<br>•	What scene was your favorite?<br>Why?<br>•	Who were some important<br>characters?<br>•	Did you enjoy the way the author<br>wrote the story? Why?|




- When possible, build family outings or recreational activities around what students are reading. For

example, if your student enjoyed a book on the National Parks, you might plan to explore a park in
your area. Even if you do not live near a National Park, you could visit a state or local park for a family
picnic or hike.


- Ask your students to identify a topic they would like to learn more about, then declare that topic a

“Family Focus” for a specific period of time. During this time, have every family member read an ageappropriate book about the topic. When the time concludes, have a special event in which everyone
shares what they learned about the topic.


**Note:** The special event does not have to be elaborate. The point is to designate a time and place to focus on
sharing. For example, if your family focused on Hawaii, the special event could simply be discussion over a family
dinner. If you wanted to be elaborate, you could serve pineapple (which was traditionally grown in Hawaii) as
dessert and have everyone try hula dancing after eating!
