**Family Letter**


**Dear Family Member,**


Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.


**Spelling Words**


This week, we will be reviewing the spellings of r-controlled vowels. Your
student learned to read and spell words with r-controlled vowels in first and
second grades, so this should be a review. Your student will be assessed on
these words.


Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, above and beginning,
to spell this week. Remember that Challenge Words do not follow spelling
patterns and need to be memorized.


New this week is the introduction of a Content Word. The Content Word
for this week is Mediterranean. This word is directly related to the material
that we are reading. The Content Word is an optional spelling word for your
student. If your student would like to try spelling it but gets it wrong, it will
not count against them on the assessment. We encourage all students to
stretch themselves a bit to try to spell this word.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 4** **9**


|The spelling words, including the C are listed below:|Challenge Words and the Content Word,|
|---|---|
|1. tarnish|12. sword|
|2. marbles|13. messenger|

**Student Reader**





This week, we start our new unit about ancient Rome. In this unit, your
student will read Stories of Ancient Rome, which includes information about
the history of Rome, legends, Roman gods and goddesses, myths, powerful
rulers, and wars, as well as the rise of Christianity. Mrs. Teachwell is the
narrator who will be guiding your student through the information, some of
which is fiction and some nonfiction, as your student learns many new and
exciting facts about one of the great civilizations. Be sure to ask your student
each evening about what they are learning.

This week, your student will be reading about the building of Rome on
the banks of the Tiber River, the Roman gods and goddesses, the Roman
Republic, and the Punic Wars.

**“Rome, Then and Now”**


“This is Rome,” said Mrs. Teachwell, pointing to a black dot on the
classroom map.

“But this is Rome, too,” she added, as she traced a circle that was so large
it seemed to touch all four sides of the map.

The students looked confused.

“How can it be both?” Charlie Chatter shouted out.

“I’ll explain,” Mrs. Teachwell said, “but please raise your hand if you
would like to speak.”

Charlie Chatter nodded. It was not the first time he had heard this. In
fact, Mrs. Teachwell had asked him to raise his hand many times, but it was
hard for Charlie. His mouth seemed to be faster than his hand.

“Rome started out as a little town along the Tiber River,” Mrs. Teachwell
explained.

“Like Egypt on the Nile?” Charlie asked.

“Yes,” said Mrs. Teachwell, “but let’s see that hand!”

The students giggled.

“As Charlie has just reminded us,” Mrs. Teachwell said, “many
**civilizations** sprang up along the banks of a river. Rome was no exception. It
sprang up here, on the banks of the Tiber River, among seven hills. At first,
Rome was just a few houses on a hill. Then, it grew and grew and grew. After
a while, people started building houses on other hills nearby. Then, the little
towns on the hills grew together to make a big city. In fact, to this day, Rome
is known as the ‘City of Seven Hills.’

“Then, the Romans fought wars with their neighbors. The Romans won
most of these wars. They **defeated** the Etruscans, who lived north of them.
They **conquered** the Greeks, who had settled to the south, as well. It wasn’t
long before they controlled most of this piece of land that we call Italy.”


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 4** **11**


Mrs. Teachwell traced the outline of Italy with her finger.

“Check it out!” Charlie Chatter shouted. “Italy looks like a boot!”

“Yes,” said Mrs. Teachwell. “Italy does look like a boot, but, please,
Charlie, raise your hand! This is your last warning. Now, does anyone know
what this body of water that the boot of Italy sticks out into is called?”

Rachel Readmuch, who always had her nose in a book, raised her hand.
Mrs. Teachwell called on her.

“It’s called the **Mediterranean**,” said Rachel.

“That’s right!” said Mrs. Teachwell. “This is the **Mediterranean** Sea.
Rome grew so much that, at its **peak**, the Romans controlled all the land
around the **Mediterranean** Sea. They took over most of Spain and France.
They took over this area that we call the Balkans. They took over Greece and
much of Turkey. They took over the Middle East, Egypt, and the coast of
North Africa. Rome was a city, but that city was the capital of a great **empire** .”

Tim Timetable, who loved to learn about when things happened, put up
his hand.

“When was all this happening?”

“Rome started growing about 2,500 years ago,” Mrs. Teachwell explained.
“It started growing about five hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ,
in the years we call **BC** for _before Christ_ . It was still growing when Jesus
was born. In fact, Jesus was born here, in a part of the Middle East that was
controlled by the Romans.”

Tim Timetable made a note of the date.

Mrs. Teachwell went on: “We will be studying Rome for three weeks or
so. Each day, we will have a report on a topic connected to ancient Rome. I’ll
give the first few reports. Then, each of you can do some research and give
the next few. How does that sound?”

The kids cheered. They were **eager** to learn more about Rome. Rachel
Readmuch already knew quite a lot. Tim Timetable had lots of questions
about what happened when. As for Charlie Chatter, he was looking forward
to the day when he would get to give his report. Then, he would get to talk
without having to raise his hand first!

**Oh, To Be a Prince Again!**

Once upon a time, an ugly, green creature named Fred the Frog sat hopeful
that his princess would come along and give him a magic kiss, so he could
once again be a handsome prince. He sat all day looking up and down the
road awaiting his princess! “I _____________ SO ugly!” he moaned. “Why
won’t my princess come to give me a kiss?” Fred the Frowning Frog looked
at the other frogs in the pond and said, pitifully, “All of you _____________
hideous!” He then turned his back on the other frogs and fretted.

Fred the Fretting, Frowning Frog shouted to the trees, the flowers, and
anything else that would listen, “A prince should not have to wait so long!
You trees and flowers _____________ not helpful at all! Can’t you send for
my princess? This _____________ taking too long!”

Just then, along came a grand carriage carrying his princess. Fred the
Faithful, Forward-Looking Frog hopped to the middle of the road and stood
up tall and important (and hopefully regal) as he said, “Oh my princess, you
_____________ just in time! The other frogs in this pond _____________
driving me crazy! Come give me a kiss so I can change back into your
handsome prince.”

Paula the Pretty Princess kissed Fred the Festive Frog, and he magically
transformed into Peter the Proud Prince. They lived happily ever after.

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.


**Spelling Words**

This week, we will be reviewing two spellings for the sound of /ee/.
Your student learned how to read and spell words with these patterns in
Grades 1 and 2, so this should be a review. Your student will be assessed on
these words.


Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, except and follow.
Challenge Words are words used very often. These Challenge Words do not
follow spelling patterns and need to be memorized. These two words will be
on the assessment.


The Content Word for this week is Colosseum. This word is directly related
to the material we are reading and follows the vowel patterns your student is
reviewing. The Content Word is an optional spelling word for your student.
If your student would like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count
against them on the test. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit
and try to spell this word.

**Spelling Words**


This week, we will be reviewing four spellings for the sound of /ee/. Your
student learned how to read and spell words with these patterns in second
grade, so this should be a review. Your student will be assessed on these
words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _again_ and _often_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. These Challenge Words do not
follow spelling patterns and need to be memorized.

The Content Word for this week is _Caesar_ . This word is directly related
to the material that we are reading and is a rare spelling that your student is
reviewing. The Content Word is an optional spelling word for your student.
If your student would like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count

|“The Second Rome:<br>From Constantine to Justinian”|“The Second Rome:<br>From Constantine to Justinian”|
|---|---|
|<br> <br>Most historians agree that the<br>Eastern Empire was at its best during<br>the reign of Justinian. Justinian came<br>into power in the year 527 AD. That<br>is, he became Emperor of Byzantium<br>527 years after the birth of Jesus<br>and about two hundred years after<br>Constantine decided to support<br>Christianity. It was also about this<br>time that years began by some to<br>be formally marked as AD – Anno<br>Domini, Latin for “in the year of the<br>Lord.”|<br>**Justinian** also completed an<br>important book project. He had<br>**scholars** gather up all the laws that<br>had been passed in the Roman<br>Empire over the years.

**How Horatius Held the Bridge**


In the early days of the Roman Republic, Rome was in danger. King
Tarquin’s son, Sextus, went into an area north of Rome. He helped an
Etruscan king raise a huge army. Then, the two of them set off to attack
Rome. The men of Rome had a meeting. They decided there was only one
way to save the city: tear down the bridge over the Tiber River. If the Romans

could tear the bridge down, the Etruscans would not be able to cross the river
and enter the city. The consul spoke to the people. “Which of you,” he asked,
“will stand forth against the Etruscans while we tear down the bridge?” The
bravest man in the history of the Roman Empire stepped forward, Horatius.
Two more men came forward to join Horatius. The Etruscans laughed when
they saw the three Romans blocking their way on the bridge. They sent their
best warriors into battle. The Romans tossed the Etruscans off the bridge.
The bridge began to totter. Horatius tried to cross, but the bridge fell before
he could get across. Then, he jumped into the river. He nearly drowned.
But, in the end, he made it across the river, back to Rome, where he was

welcomed as a hero. The people of Rome made a statue of Horatius to honor
him. His statue is probably the most famous statue in all of Rome.

**The Second Rome: From Constantine to Justinian**


Constantine was the first Roman **Emperor** to support Christianity.
He issued an order that made it illegal to put Christians to death, or even
throw them in jail.

Constantine built churches all over the **empire, including the**
**completion of an enormous church called The Basilica Nova.** He built one
in Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. He built another in Jerusalem, where
Jesus died. He built churches in the ancient city of Byzantium, in presentday Turkey. Byzantium was Constantine’s favorite city. He adopted it and
renamed it Constantinople. His goal was to turn the city into a “new Rome,”
a sort of Rome away from Rome.Constantine did not want Constantinople
to replace Rome. He hoped that Constantinople would take its place beside
Rome and that the two cities would survive, side by side, for many years. He
wanted Rome and Constantinople to be like two mighty **pillars** supporting
the Roman Empire. But, in the end, one of those **pillars collapsed** .

One of the **emperors** who ruled after Constantine decided his job was
just too big. He felt that the Roman **Empire** was too large to be ruled by any
one man, so he split the **empire** into two parts. He declared that the western
half of the Empire would be ruled by one **emperor**, based in Rome; the
eastern half would be ruled by a second **emperor**, based in Constantinople.

Eventually, the Eastern Roman **Empire** completely separated from
the Western Roman **Empire** . Once separated, it wasn’t called the Eastern


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 4** **121**


Roman Empire anymore. By 410 **AD**, the **Eastern Empire** was known as
the Byzantine **Empire** .

Not long after the **empire** was divided, **invaders** from the North began
attacking the Western **Empire** . Things got worse and worse. The **invaders**
even attacked Rome itself. By 500 **AD**, the Western Empire had **collapsed**,
with most of the provinces falling to one **barbarian** tribe or another.


The Western Empire in Europe— from Italy across France and
Germany and all the way to Britain—drifted into a long, sad period
without leadership and **vision** from the powers of Rome. The glorious
Roman **Empire** finally came to an end.

The Eastern **Empire**, based in Constantinople, had better luck. It lived
on, and for a while, even got stronger.

Most **historians** agree that the Eastern Empire was at its best during
the **reign** of Justinian. Justinian came into power in the year 527 AD. That
is, he became **Emperor** of Byzantium 527 years after the birth of Jesus and
about two hundred years after Constantine decided to support Christianity.
It was also about this time that years began by some to be formally marked
as AD – _Anno Domini_, Latin for “in the year of the Lord.”


Like Constantine before him, Justinian was a Christian. He spent lots of
money building churches. In Constantinople, he built the church of Hagia
Sophia [ho-GEE-ə Soe-FEE-yə], with its **magnificent**, soaring dome that is
still standing today.

Justinian also completed an important book project. He had scholars
gather up all of the laws that had been passed in the Roman **Empire** over
the years. What the scholars found was a big mess. There were so many
laws, nobody could possibly keep track of them all. There were old laws
that no longer made sense. There were even laws that seemed to be the
opposite of one another. One law might say “it is **illegal** to do X.” Then
another law might say “it’s perfectly fine to do X.” Justinian had his scholars
gather up all the laws, sort them out, and organize them. When they were
done, they published the laws. The new, organized laws filled several
books. The new organized laws were known as **Justinian’s Code** . The
Justinian Code is one of Justinian’s major accomplishments as **emperor** .
Justinian appears in the center of this **mosaic**, which you can see today in
an Italian church.

_Directions: Read the article “Roman Architecture Is All Around,” then answer the_
_questions that follow._

**Roman Architecture Is All Around**


Architecture is the most important contribution of the Roman Empire
to our world. Architecture is the design or style of a building. People go to

Rome just to see its ancient buildings. Many of the old building elements are
also seen in American buildings. The Colosseum, arches, and aqueducts of
the ancient Romans remain today.


The Roman Colosseum was like a big sports stadium. Roman fans
watched people fighting each other or animals. Sometimes, the fighters or
animals died! Even so, modern football stadiums are built much like the
Colosseum. They are round in shape and seat many fans.


The Romans were one of history’s most creative people. They used arches
in many of their buildings and bridges. The arch is a rounded shape at the

top of windows or doorways that allows them to be very wide. The curved
stone wedges in an arch offer strong support. Arches are seen today in
churches, libraries, and government buildings.


The Romans invented the aqueduct. The aqueduct consists of a channel
supported by arches. It uses gravity and pipes to move water from high in the
mountains to the city that lies on lower ground. The United States has some
of the world’s largest aqueducts. They supply water to the country’s biggest
cities. The Colorado River Aqueduct provides the Los Angeles area with
water carried from the Colorado River, more than 701.5 miles away!
