#### **[Etu, ]**

**the Hunter**
# **1**

We walked silently and carefully across the **glistening**
snow. The sun shone on the snow and made it sparkle
and shine like the stars in the night sky. Before we left
our camp, my brothers had told me many times that I
must do exactly as they said. If I did not, they would
send me away.


They said that as we walked, I must step silently
and carefully into my older brother’s footprints. My
oldest brother, Hakan, was six years older than me.
He was the lead tracker. His footprints led the way.
My brother Delsin was three years older than me. He
followed closely behind Hakan, stepping easily into his
footprints. I was right behind Delsin, trying hard not to
wobble from side to side as I stepped into his enormous
footprints.

My father and uncles moved in a straight line some
distance behind us. These were the men in our family
who hunted and killed the great creatures that roamed
across the land we lived on. Each man held a flinttipped spear and an atlatl, or spear thrower. My brothers
and I had our slingshots slung over our shoulders. This
was my first hunt. We were following a herd of woolly
mammoths. We were waiting for one member of the
herd to fall behind. As soon as it did, the men would
move forward and drive it into a ditch. We had to be
careful though. It was important that the creature did
not sense our presence. If it did, it would certainly
charge at us using its great size and curved tusks as
powerful weapons. If this happened, the herd itself
would panic and would **stampede** for sure.


I loved to listen to the sound of the crunching snow
beneath our feet. I loved the feel of the icy wind against
my cheeks. All around, the tips of tall, green grass sprang
up from the snow-covered land. The woolly mammoths
dined on the lush grass. They used their tusks to push
the snow aside so that they could reach every juicy part
of it.

9


We walked until the sun began to sink in the sky
and a golden haze touched the shimmering earth. I
spotted various clumps of tall grass that brought faint
color to the mostly white, crisp **terrain** . As we walked,
I thought about my mother and sister, who were also at
work. They were repairing the **shelter** we had built from
mammoth skin, bones, branches, and earth. Several days
earlier, strong winds had damaged the camp we had set
up near the herd. They knew, as did we, that mammoth
flesh could feed many people for quite some time. It
could be dried and saved so that it lasted until the next
successful hunt. A mammoth’s skin and fur could be
made into warm clothing or it could be used to make a
cozy **shelter** .


10


11


Suddenly, my brother Hakan stopped moving and
raised an arm. Then, he signaled for us to crouch down.
We immediately did as he commanded. I peeked around
to see the men behind us doing the same thing. My
brother put a finger to his lips and looked at us directly,
signaling us to be quiet. I could tell that he had spotted a
lone woolly mammoth.


As we crouched down in the snow, the hunters began
to move forward. I held my breath as my father and
uncles moved past us. I knew that they would not use
their spears until the giant creature had been cornered
in the ditch with no way out. My heart pounded in my
chest as I watched the men suddenly surround what
seemed to be a young mammoth. They drove it with
such skill into the snow-covered ditch, whooping and
hollering as they went. Then, without hesitating, my
father and uncles launched their spears. I watched this
great and powerful creature fall, crashing to the ground.

#### **Akando** **and Aponi,**

**the Gatherers**



I stared up at the blue sky and squinted. It was hot.
There was not a cloud in the sky. Even though the leaves
on the trees were now changing to splendid colors that
made me stop and stare, the intense heat of the sun
still lingered. I stood for a moment and rested my tired
feet. I could tell that the heat of the day would soon be
replaced by an explosive thunderstorm.


I glanced back toward our village, but it was now
almost completely out of sight. I couldn’t see the roofs of
the houses and storage rooms, nor the smoke rising up
from each family hearth. I could, however, still see our
chief ’s home. I could also still glimpse the **ceremonial**
buildings that sat upon the large mounds that my people
**constructed** .


14


15


My brother Akando and I had been sent out with our
baskets to gather wild fruits, berries, and nuts. In fact,
this was the time of the year when most of the children
in our village were put to work. This was the time of year
when the children gathered nuts, fruits, and berries that
could be preserved or dried. We also gathered wild onions
and milkweed. This food would be needed when the
earth was frozen. It was important that we gathered what
nature provided for us before the rains came and washed
it all away or the frost came and killed it.


16


_Food that children gathered_



17


The crops that we grew, sunflowers, corn, squash,
and tobacco, were also being harvested. Some of the
older children were busily helping in the fields. Only the
spiritual leaders were allowed to gather tobacco and the
roots and bark that were used for medicine.


I looked ahead, in search of Akando. My brother was
so far ahead of me that I was losing sight of him.


“Akando, slow down,” I called to my brother. “Can
we rest for a while?”


Akando looked back at me. He is my older brother,
though not by much, and he is stronger than I am.
Akando had a large **birch** bark basket strapped around
his waist. It was almost full to the brim with hickory
nuts and hazelnuts. I had a basket strapped to my waist
too. Mine was smaller than his and it was only half full
with butternuts and acorns.


“Just for a short while, Aponi,” he yelled back. “We
haven’t even begun to collect the berries.”


18


19


Akando walked back and sat down beside me on the
ground. “Want to play a game?” he asked.


“Yes. What game?” I replied eagerly.


“We’ll play a guessing game,” Akando replied. “Now,
turn away until I say you can look.”


Akando was very bossy but I loved him. He always
stuck up for me when some of the children in the village
teased me.


“Okay, ready!” said Akando.


I turned around to see that three large, **autumnal**
oak leaves had been placed on the ground. Akando had
placed a stone under one of them and I had to guess
which one. I only had one guess. We would do this three
times, then we would switch and Akando would have to
guess.


“The one in the middle,” I said hopefully.


“Wrong!” exclaimed Akando. “It’s the one on the
left,” he said as he lifted up the leaf to reveal the stone.


My next guess was also wrong, but my third and final
guess was correct.


20


21


“Now, it’s your turn,” I said.


As always, Akando beat me. He got two out of three
guesses right.


“Okay, let’s go,” he said, urging me on. “The sooner
we gather all that we can, the sooner we can return
home.”


“I guess,” I said but I continued to sit on the ground.


“Later on, if you like, I will show you how to beat me
in the guessing game,” Akando offered, trying to spur me
on.


It worked.


“Really?” I asked, jumping to my feet and picking up
my basket.


“Really!” Akando replied. “But first you have to fill
that basket!”


“Okay,” I said, smiling at him.


Then, I grabbed my brother’s hand and walked with
him beneath the canopy of red-, gold-, and coppercolored leaves.

# **3**


### **Alemeda,**

**the Basket Weaver**



“Alemeda! Where are you?” my mother called.


I did not answer. Instead, I crept around the corner
of our home and hid. I waited and watched in the
cooling shade. I held my breath. I was just about to
close my eyes when a lizard raced across my bare feet. It
tickled.


“She’s hiding from you,” my younger brother Kele
announced. “She’s over there,” he said, pointing towards
me.


I did not reply but stuck my tongue out at Kele. He
was always getting me into trouble.


“Alemeda, we need you. We have work to do. We
must finish the baskets,” my mother said, as I made my
way towards her. She was not angry but it was clear that
she was not going to let me play. I had work to do.


24


25


I walked slowly towards the shaded area that my
father had **constructed** out of wooden poles and a
covering. I kicked at the dirt as I walked. There were
several of these structures scattered around our village.
Women could be found sitting under them weaving
baskets of various shapes and sizes. They also created a
whole host of other things. Men could be found sitting
together shaping tools for hunting and farming.


All of the women in our village made baskets. Baskets
were very important because they were used for carrying
water, for storing grain, fruits, nuts, and berries, and
even for cooking.


“Sit near me,” my grandmother said as I came and
stood beside her.


I sighed deeply and threw myself down on the
ground next to her.


She smiled and handed me the basket I had begun to
make the day before.


“Our people have been making these baskets since
time began,” she said. “This skill has been handed down
from one **generation** to the next. It is important that
you learn it, Alemeda.”


26


27


“I know,” I replied, and then I sighed again. “But I
would rather learn how to hunt than weave baskets,” I
admitted.


My grandmother laughed out loud. “When I was
your age, I thought the same thing,” she replied.


“Really?” I asked, looking at her wise, old face.
“Then, why are you making me do it?” I asked eagerly,
wondering if there was a way out.


Grandmother looked at me for a few moments before
she replied. Then she asked, “When you hunt, or fish, or
even farm, what are you going to do with the food you
have provided?”


“Eat it!” I exclaimed cheerfully.


“But we can’t eat everything at once,” she chuckled.
“We must save the corn we harvest. We must dry some
of the meat we hunt for, we must **store** the fruits and
berries we gather. We must **store** this food safely so that
we can survive during the time when the sun has turned
away from us. You will come to see, Alemeda, how
important it is to learn this skill. Now, remember what
I told you yesterday. All coiled baskets are made from
plants that bend easily. Plants such as yucca, split willow,
rabbitbrush, or skunkbrush are the best.”


28


29


“I remember,” I said, still not convinced that I
wouldn’t be happier hunting. “Is that why we can also
make rope, sandals, mats, and even clothes out of these
plants that bend easily?” I asked, trying not to sound too
interested.


“Yes, these plants have many uses. But it is our skill
as weavers that enables us to make these things.”


Together we began to weave the baskets that my
people had been making since time began.

### **Meda and Flo,**

**the Forest Children**



“Flo, I’ll race you to that tree over there,” said Meda,
pointing to one of the maple trees.


“Okay,” I said confidently. I was one of the fastest
runners among the girls of my age in our village. I
wondered why Meda was even challenging me to a race.


Immediately, Meda flew like an arrow straight toward
her target. She was clearly hoping that a quick start would
give her an advantage over me. However, like a shooting
star that bursts across the night sky, I was on her heels in
no time. Just before we reached the tree, I passed her and
touched the tree trunk.


“I won,” I exclaimed. “You’re pretty fast though,
Meda,” I admitted. “Considering you are a year younger
than me, that was quite a race!”


“Yes! This time next year, when we return to the maple
tree forest, I’ll be able to beat you,” Meda said confidently,
while at the same time grinning at me.


32


33


I grinned back. “I’ll still be a year older than you,” I
said rising to the challenge.


“I know. You’ll always be that. But I have a feeling
that this time next year, I will be taller than you,” she
replied as if she were stating a fact.


“Well, we’ll see about that,” I replied as I eyed her
feet. They were already bigger than mine and she was
only a thumb size shorter than me. I couldn’t help
thinking that she might be right, but I wasn’t going to
admit it.


This was my favorite time of year by far. It was the
time of year when the eagles built their spring nests.
The chickadees made their strange, eerie call in the early
morning. The snow was melting all around and tree buds
were emerging daily.


This was also the time of year when my family, along
with my uncles and aunts and their children, set up
camp in the maple tree forest. We did this every year at
the beginning of spring. We left our summer and winter
village and returned to our camp in the forest. In the fall
we camped near the fields we planted our crops in.


34


35


We always returned to the same maple forest camp. It
was a good-sized clearing encircled by a large number of
maple trees and **birch** trees. We returned here each year
to collect the **sap** from the maple trees and turn it into
the sweet syrup that we all loved so much.


This year we were lucky. The winter winds and
frequent snowfall had not destroyed our wigwam frames
from the previous year. We only had to wrap the deerskin
that we had carried with us around the frames. After we
made our campfire, the children had a chance to play
before the real work began.


Once we were settled, the men would use their axes
to make small, deep cuts in the trunks of the maple trees.
Then, we would wait for the **sap** to **trickle** out. As it did,
the women and children would funnel the **sap** into **birch**
baskets or clay pots. We used curved pieces of cedar wood
or hollowed-out sumac stems as funnels.


36


37


**Sap** from the maple tree looks like water when it
first **trickles** out from inside the tree. Once the **sap** is
collected, my mother and aunts cook it in a clay pot.
Sometimes, they put the pot right on the open campfire.
Other times, they put red-hot rocks right into the clay
pots. After you’ve cooked it for a while, the **sap** turns
into sweet syrup. If you keep on cooking it, the **sap** turns
into sugar.


During this time, the older girls also collect **birch**
bark. They strip the bark from the trees and pound
it until it can be shaped and molded into storage
containers or dishes. The men and boys busy themselves
hunting and fishing. In the evening, we all spend time
together around the campfire exchanging stories.


“Come on, Flo,” yelled Meda, who had wandered off
to watch the men at work. “I can smell dinner cooking.”


She was right. The succulent smell of deer meat
wafted up into the crisp evening air.


“Race you back,” I announced. This time I took off
like an arrow shot from my father’s bow.

#### **Adoette** **and Awan,**

**the Bird Chasers**



“Adoette, it’s time to go,” whispered Awan. “The sun
is almost up!”


“I’m coming,” Adoette replied softly as she tiptoed
through the doorway of her home. “I have fish for us to
eat later,” she continued.


“I have water for us to drink,” Awan said as he
smiled at Adoette.


The children chatted with each other as they made
their way towards their family’s cornfield. The cornfield
was a short distance from their village near the river. As
they walked, the sound of crows cawing rose up into the
warm, spring air. The crows had returned to signal that
wintertime was over. The warmth of the sun was once
again encouraging life in the sleeping Earth.


40


41


The sun was a yellow **haze** on the **horizon** as the
two children walked together. Adoette and Awan had
the important job of scaring the crows away from the
corn seeds that had been planted in the field. The crows
had returned just in time to watch the men of the village
plant their crops. The dirt, no longer frozen, was now
warm enough for planting. Using a hoe fashioned from
the jaw bone of a deer and a small tree branch, the men
created long, thin **channels** in the dirt. They placed the
corn seeds one footprint apart in the bottom of each
**channel** . They covered the seeds with dirt and watched
as the rainfall and the sunshine did the rest. Each family
group had its own cornfield. Corn was an important
crop. It could be **stored** for the winter in grass-covered
pits. Corn was used to make flour for fried cakes, breads,
and puddings. The husks of the corn plant were used to
make baskets and mats. In addition to corn, each family
grew beans and squash. They also hunted and fished.


Once the corn was planted, the women and children
checked to make sure the young seedlings got plenty of
water. If the spring rains did not come and water the
earth, then the women and children did. The children
also had the job of protecting the young plants from all
kinds of hungry critters.


42


43


Adoette and Awan were sent to the family cornfield
each day to guard the crop. As the corn crop had just
been planted, crows were the worst enemy. They would
either dig up the newly planted seeds with their sharp
talons or they would wait for the seeds to **germinate** .
Then, they would pull up each seedling plant, cawing
with delight as they consumed the corn seed and
discarded the rest.


As the two children arrived in the cornfield, they
could see that several crows were already there. The
crows sat in the dirt, watching the young plants.
Adoette and Awan placed their supplies on the ground
and yelled at the crows. The crows stared at the children
with their coal-black eyes. Then, they flapped their
wings and flew away. One crow, however, could not
quite lift its body off the ground and instead tried to
**scuttle** away from the children. It made its way towards
some low-lying shrubs.


“Oh, it’s injured!” exclaimed Adoette. “We must
help it.”


“Help it!” screeched Awan. “We’re supposed to chase
it away.” “If it can’t fly, it could be eaten up by any
number of creatures,” continued Adoette eagerly.


44


45


“If it can’t fly, it could be eaten up by any number of
creatures,” continued Adoette eagerly.


“You are crazy,” said Awan.


Slowly, Adoette made her way towards the crow. The
crow had stopped moving just in front of a shrub. It had
turned to look at Adoette.


“Are you injured?” Adoette asked the bird softly.
“Here, let me help you.”


The crow inched its body under the shrub and
stared intently at Adoette.


Adoette sat down in the dirt and chatted with the
crow for a while. Awan, unhappy with his cousin’s
behavior, stomped off to look for snakes. Eventually,
Adoette reached in under the shrub and gently yet
confidently picked up the bird. The crow flapped its
wings for a second or two, but then settled down in
Adoette’s arms.


When Awan returned, he found Adoette watching
the field with a crow in her arms.


46


47


“What are you going to do with it?” asked Awan,
who was quite astonished by the sight of his cousin
cuddling a crow.


“I’m going to make it better,” Adoette exclaimed.


Awan simply shook his head.


For the rest of the day, the two children guarded the
corn crop. When the sun began to set, they made their
way back to the village. Adoette walked proudly beside
Awan, carrying the enemy in her arms.

**Chapter**
## **Yutu,**

**the Dog Trainer**
# **6**

“Come here, Miki,” I called. Miki had been the runt
of the **litter** . He had been puny and sickly for the first
weeks of his life. My father was sure that he would die.
I fed him and kept him warm, sometimes sneaking him
into my cozy bed at night. I gave him the Inuit [in-ue-it]
name for small.


Miki wagged his tail and scampered toward me.
Then, he plopped down right on my feet and rested his
head on the snow.


When Miki’s brothers and sisters were old enough to
be weaned from their mother, my father began to train
them to be sled dogs. My people, the Inuit, are expert
dog sled trainers. That’s because we live in a land that is
frozen for a large part of the year. So, we rely a lot on our
dogs to help us travel and hunt.


50


51


Inuit sled dogs have to be strong and fast. When
Miki was younger, he was neither of these things. Sled
dogs have to pull heavy loads and travel across long
distances as speedily as they can. We Inuit live by our
**wits** . We hunt and fish across this frozen land. We travel
across the snow and ice in our sleds **crafted** from bones
or antlers, seal hide, and even frozen salmon skin. We
build snow homes made from blocks of snow as we go.


Our dogs have to be able to sniff out seal breathing
holes or stand firm with the other dogs when they come
across a polar bear. I couldn’t imagine Miki doing any of
these things, but he would have to. My father had made
it clear that he would have to earn his keep. I had grown
up watching my father train the dogs. When the dogs
are young, they are always eager to run, but they are less
willing to work together. They have to be taught how to
pull the sleds together, as a team. My father knows just
how to talk to them. His voice is firm and they obey
him. This is important. When the dogs are pulling the
sleds, they must all obey the commands given by the
driver of the sled.


52


53


There are a number of ways to hitch the dogs so
that they can pull the sleds. Quite often they are tied
in pairs to a single towline. In deep snow, sometimes
it is better to have the dogs pull the sled in a single
line. This way, they can make a path through the
snow. If the snow is packed down hard, a fan hitch is
best. This means that the dogs are attached to the sled
by their own individual towlines.


The dogs themselves are more able to live in
this frozen land than people are. They have thick,
waterproof fur coats. Their ears are extra furry to
prevent frostbite. Their paws are large and have thick
pads with fur. Miki frequently jumps on me with
his enormous paws and knocks me over. Their large,
bushy tails can curl around their faces at night and
keep them warm.


54


55


Once Miki was strong enough, I began to train him.
At first, I worked with him on basic obedience. Then, I
harnessed him to a towline and had him pull small loads
of wrapped furs across the snow. The very first time he
had to pull something, he raced off like an **arctic** fox.
He thought we were playing a game. He soon learned
to pull like I needed him to, though. He was also super
fast. I felt sad for Miki. If he hadn’t been so sickly, I’m
sure he could have been a **lead** dog.


My father had watched me as I trained Miki. I think
even he was surprised by how well Miki progressed.
Miki had been by my side ever since he was a small
puppy. Today was the day that he would leave me. He
was going with my father and uncles on a hunting trip.
They would be gone for several weeks.


I bent down and patted Miki on the head. He
immediately sat up and licked my face.


“Be good, Miki. Do what you are told. Follow the
other dogs and listen to my father. Do you hear me?”
I said to him. Miki looked right at me and wagged his
tail. Then, my father came and led him away.

**Chapter**

#### **Texas Paintbrush**
# **7**

Long ago, amongst the rolling hills of Central Texas,
the Comanche people faced hard times. A drought had
gripped the land. Rain refused to fall. The sun burned
hot and fierce. The once green hills lay brown and
wilted. The rivers and streams slowly dried up until
even the strongest were mere trickles. The buffalo herds
the Comanche depended on were drifting further and
further away.


The dry days became weeks, and the weeks became
months. And still, the drought remained.


“I fear the worst,” one of the elders said one night at
the council fire. The other elders nodded. There was less
and less food to be found for the people of the tribe.


“All we have stored for the winter is pemmican,”
another elder grumbled. “Old pemmican, and not
enough of it.” There was more muttering around the fire.
“We should leave these lands for greener pastures, where
the rain still falls and the rivers flow.”


58


59


Voices rose in protest. As hard as things were, few
wanted to leave on a long journey to unknown lands.
Finally, the eldest and wisest of the elders stood up. “We
must remain hopeful and strong,” the elder urged them.
“Until the rains come and the grass grows.”


It was during this troubled time that a young
Comanche girl named Bright Feather was growing up.
She was gifted with a heart full of hope and a talent to
paint. Each day, she wandered the plains, picking up
roots and berries. Once she **crushed** them and mixed
them with water, she would have paints of the most
vibrant colors. She used brushes made from the finest
hind fur of a deer. Sometimes, the entire tribe would
gather to watch her paint and marvel at the result.


“Bright Feather’s paintings are the brightest things in
these dark days,” the elders said.


Her most prized item was a small jar with paint made
from a special flower that had not bloomed since her
grandmother’s time. The paint was a bright red, as vivid
as a raging prairie fire. Many times, she had thought
about using the paint, but each time, she stopped herself.
“I only have enough to use once,” she thought to herself.
“Then it will be gone forever.”


60


61


One hot night, Bright Feather had a dream. In her
dream, she was standing on a hill looking over her tribe,
watching the sun set. As the sun slowly sank, it lit the sky
with colors more dazzling than anything she had seen
before. The light touched the brown land, and suddenly,
it began to bloom. The grass grew green and tall. The
streams filled with clear rushing water. Life returned to
the land around her.


When she woke, Bright Feather was filled with hope.
She set out to bring her dream to life. She gathered
her paints and brushes and set out for the hill outside
her tribe. She began to paint. With each stroke of the
brush, the painted sunset grew brighter and fuller. The
Comanche people began to drop by the hillside to watch
as Bright Feather painted.


Day after day, she painted without rest or food or
water. She knew that something was missing from her
painted sunset.


“It is beautiful,” one woman told her.


“Almost as bright as the real thing,” another assured her.


“It is not bright enough,” Bright Feather said firmly
and kept painting.


62


63


Finally, she realized what was needed. With a heavy
heart, she took her cherished jar of vibrant red paint and
used it to finish her painting. Members of the tribe stood
around her, gazing at her painted sunset. They marveled
at the stunning colors. It gave them hope that the hard
times could not last.


**Weary** but satisfied, Bright Feather set her brushes
down, still stained red with the last of her cherished
paint. Then, she fell into a deep sleep.


When she woke up, she found that her paintbrushes
had sprouted roots. The grass of the hillside was
now covered with flowers of the same fiery red as her
cherished paint. Looking around, she saw that the
plains around the land, as far as the eye could see, were
blanketed in the same vibrant colors—the colors of the
setting sun in her painting.


Seeing the flowers, one of the elders said, “They
remind me of a prairie fire. We should call them that.”


Bright Feather shook her head and said, “No, we
should call them paintbrushes.”

Just as in her dream, the rains began to fall. Green
grass grew amongst the red flowers. The rivers filled, and
the buffalo herds returned. The land once again began to
**thrive**, thanks to Bright Feather.


Even today, the beautiful red paintbrush flowers
bloom every spring in Texas when the rains fall. They
remind us of Bright Feather’s hope and creativity, and
the power of selflessness. And mostly, they remind us
that even in the hardest of times, hope remains.
