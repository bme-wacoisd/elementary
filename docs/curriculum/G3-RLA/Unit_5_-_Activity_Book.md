**Take-Home Letter**



Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing all eight spelling patterns for the sound /ee/
that we have already learned. Your student will be tested on these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _almost_ and _really_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. While _almost_ does not follow
the spelling pattern of /ee/, _really_ does as the ‘ea’ and the ‘y’ in _really_ are both
pronounced /ee/.

The Content Word for this week is _electricity_ . This word is directly related
to the material that we are reading in _Adventures in Light and Sound_ . The
Content Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student
would like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on
the test. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit and try to spell
this word.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **9**


|The spelling words, including the are listed below:|Challenge Words and the Content Word,|
|---|---|
|1. succeeded|12. stadium|
|2. money|13. chariot|
|3. enemy|14. degree|
|4. centipede|15. athlete|

**Student Reader**





The chapters your student will read this week in _Adventures in Light and_
_Sound_ include information about what light is, how shadows are made, and
mirrors and reflections. Be sure to ask your student each evening about what
they are learning.

Students will take home text copies of the chapters in the Reader throughout
the unit. Encouraging students to read a text directly related to this domainbased unit will provide content and vocabulary reinforcement. Your student
will also bring home a copy of the glossary for use in reading the text copies
to family members. The bolded words on the text copies are the words found
in the glossary.

**Read-Aloud: Excerpts from “What Is Light?”**



Samuel lifted himself out of his garden chair and stood beneath the giant
oak. As he stood, he gazed out into his beautiful garden that was bursting
with color and scent and began to speak.


“Our main source of light and heat is the sun, a hot star of ‘glowing gas.’”
Samuel smiled as he went on. “Light illuminates objects and makes them
visible. Light spreads out in all directions. Because of light, our eyes and
our brains are able to form pictures of the world we live in. I have spent my
life painting those pictures. Light gives us every sunrise and every sunset.
Without light, there is only darkness.”


Jack stared up into the sky. “I’ve always wondered how exactly light
reaches us here on Earth. The sun is more than 92,000,000 miles away!”


“Light travels in the form of tiny waves called light waves,” explained
Samuel. “These light waves travel in straight paths called rays. Rays of light
waves travel at the fastest speed possible in a vacuum, a place that has no
tiny particles or bits of matter. Because most of outer space has very few
particles, it is a vacuum, and light travels there at the remarkable speed of
approximately 186,000 miles a second!”


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **13**


“Light from the sun reaches Earth because it can pass so quickly through
outer space. There is almost nothing to block its path. Once light reaches
Earth’s atmosphere, it slows down a little bit.”


“The atmosphere is like a blanket of air full of gases and moisture that
covers the Earth. This blanket of air slows the light down.”


“Then,” Samuel continued, “the speed of light slows down even more
because objects start getting in the way of the light rays.” Samuel pointed
to the lemonade. “For example, rays of light waves move more slowly when
traveling through liquids, such as this lemonade.” Then Samuel pointed to
the oak tree. “Light waves cannot pass through other objects, such as this
beautiful oak tree. Because rays of light waves travel in a straight line, they
cannot bend around the tree, either; instead, they leave a shadow, or shade,
on the other side of it.”


“Another important thing to remember is light is fuel for our planet,”
announced Samuel. “Light is energy! Energy from the sun supports all forms
of life on this planet. Without light and heat from the sun, the farmer would
not have food to harvest. In fact, we could not exist on Earth!”


“Isn’t it amazing that stars make their own light, but the moon does not?
Sunlight bounces off the moon to make it look like it’s shining brightly in the
night sky,” mused Samuel. “Of course, I could sit here all night and talk about
why light is so important, not only for myself as a painter, but also for our
very existence,” he said contemplatively.

**What Is Light?**


Did you know that the sun is the greatest **source** of light for our planet,
Earth? But what is light? Why is it so important?

Hot gases of the sun give off both light and heat **energy** . Light carries
**energy**, with the long **wavelengths** carrying the least and the short **wavelengths**
carrying the most. When you think of something with lots of **energy**, what
comes to mind?

Do you think of something fast like a race car? Do you think of
something with great force like a very strong wind knocking down a tree?

Believe it or not, light can be many times more energetic than a car or
the wind.

Light travels at 186,000 miles every second in a **vacuum** . At that **speed**,
light can go around Earth more than seven times every second! No humanmade machine can go that fast—not even a jet plane or rocket!

One way that light travels, including light from the sun, is in the form of
**waves** . Scientists can measure how long light **waves** are. **Waves** can be different
sizes—some are long and some are short. Some light **waves** are visible and
some are invisible. Whether you can see light or not depends on the length of
the **wave** . The longest **wavelength** of visible light is seen as red and the shortest
**wavelength** is violet. Short **wavelengths** carry the most **energy** .

The sun gives off what is called **white light** . Perhaps you think of the
light from the sun as having no color at all. Maybe you think the light from
the sun is more yellow in color. It may surprise you to know that the sun’s
light, **white light**, is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. **White light**
includes light of different **wavelengths**, including all the colors we can see.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **21**


Of all the **wavelengths** in the sun’s light, there is just a little more of the
yellow **wavelengths** than the other colors. This is why the sun looks yellow
when we see it against the blue sky. Still, the light from the sun includes all
of the other colors and **wavelengths** . You will learn more about **white light**,
visible light, and colors in a later chapter in this Reader.

Although the sun is the greatest **source** of visible light, there are also
other **sources** of light. What else in the sky provides light? The other stars in
the night sky provide light, though it is not as bright as the light from the sun
during the day. The moon is not a star and does not give off its own light.

Can you think of other **sources** of light? Is there light in your classroom
right now? Perhaps it is from the sun shining through the windows. Chances
are good, though, that some of the light in the room may be coming from
light bulbs. Like the sun, most light bulbs give off **white light** . **Electric** lights
are such a part of our everyday life, we don’t even think about them—unless
the **electricity** goes off! This doesn’t happen often, but sometimes it does
during a bad storm. When the electricity goes off and we do not have light
from light bulbs, people sometimes use other **sources** of light, like flashlights
or candles.

Light is important for many reasons. Light and heat **energy** from the sun
warms Earth. Without the light and heat **energy** from the sun, Earth would
be freezing cold. You also learned back in kindergarten that the sun’s light is
needed for plants to grow. Also, without light, there would be no colors. Can
you think of another reason that light is important?


Try to imagine a world in which there is no light—no sun, no stars, no
candles, and no light bulbs. What would be different? If you just said that it
would be dark, you are only partly right. What else would change? Without
light, you would not be able to see anything! A world without light is almost
impossible to imagine.

**How Are Shadows Made?**


Do you remember any interesting facts about how light travels? In the
last chapter, you learned that it travels in waves that can be measured as
wavelengths. You also learned that it travels at a very high rate of speed.
Here’s another interesting fact—light waves travel from a source in straight
lines that spread out in all directions, like rays.

Have you ever wondered what happens when a line or path of light
bumps into something in its way? Different things may happen depending
on what exactly is in the light’s path.

If a path of light hits something that is **transparent**, most of the light will
pass right through. Air, water, and glass are all **transparent** . When light hits
these **transparent** objects, it passes through to the other side. It is almost as
if the object isn’t there.

Most buildings have glass windows so that natural sunlight can travel
from the outdoors inside. Have you ever been in a building that has a glass
roof or **skylight** ? Sometimes you can even see blue sky and clouds through
the **skylight** !

Light cannot travel through all materials. If a path of light hits something
that is **opaque**, the light is **absorbed** and blocked by the object. It cannot
continue in a straight line through the object. Wood, cardboard, and even a
person’s body are all **opaque** objects. Light cannot pass through to the other
side. Instead, a **shadow** is created because the light is **absorbed** .

Look around your classroom. Do you see **transparent** objects through
which light is passing? Can you also find **opaque** objects? You will probably
find that your classroom has many more **opaque** objects than **transparent**
objects. Do you see any **shadows** ?

The **shadow** created by blocked light takes on the shape of the object.

**Mirrors and Reflections**


Have you been to the dentist recently? Do you remember if they used
a tool with a **mirror** to look at your teeth? Think for a minute about how
useful that **mirror** is. Why does the dentist use it? This simple tool allows
them to see the back of your teeth. They can also see teeth way in the back of
your mouth. Without it, they couldn’t do their job nearly as well! Ask to see
this tool the next time you’re at the dentist.

So what is a **mirror** ? A **mirror** has a smooth, shiny **surface** that **reflects**
light. Light that is **reflected** bounces off of something in its path. You have
already learned that light travels in a straight line, unless it runs into something
in its way. If light hits a transparent object, it passes right through the object.
If it hits an opaque object, the light is absorbed and blocked so a shadow is
made. If light hits a smooth, shiny surface like a **mirror**, it is **reflected** .

When a **mirror** is made, glass is coated with hot, **silvery** metals and then
cooled. This coating makes the **mirror** shiny so it **reflects** back all the light
that hits it.

Did you know that there are different types of **mirrors** ? You probably
use a **plane mirror** every morning when you get ready for school. A **plane**
**mirror** has a more or less flat **surface** . The **reflection** of something in a
**plane mirror** is almost the same size as the real object.

**Plane mirrors** are used in many tools. Cameras, telescopes, and
microscopes sometimes use **plane mirrors** . Some toys even use **plane**
**mirrors** . Have you ever looked through a toy called a **kaleidoscope** ?
A **kaleidoscope** is a tube with **plane** **mirrors** inside. There are also tiny
bits of colored glass and beads sealed up inside the **kaleidoscope** . You look


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **49**


through a small hole at one end of the **kaleidoscope** and point it toward the
light. As you rotate the tube, you will see beautiful, colored patterns.

There are two other types of mirrors that are different from **plane mirrors** .
**Plane mirrors** have flat surfaces, but **concave** and **convex** **mirrors** have
**curved** surfaces. The smooth, shiny side of a **concave mirror** **curves** inward
like a spoon. The smooth, shiny side of a **convex mirror** **curves** outward.

Here’s another way that **concave** and **convex** **mirrors** are different from
**plane mirrors** . Remember that in a **plane mirror,** the **reflection** of an object
is about the same size as the object. In **concave** and **convex mirrors**, the
**reflection** can look larger or smaller than the real object.

**Concave** and **convex mirrors** are also useful. **Concave mirrors** can be
used to provide heat using the light from the sun. Remember that sunlight is
a form of light and heat energy.

What about **convex mirrors** ? The next time you get on a bus, take a
look at the mirrors on the sides of the bus. Most buses and large trucks have
a small, extra **convex mirror** on the side-view **plane mirror** . The **convex**
**mirror** makes objects look smaller but shows a wider area so you can see
more. It helps drivers avoid hitting something they might not see in the
regular **plane mirror** .

So now you see how useful **mirrors** are in our everyday lives. **Mirrors**
can also be a lot of fun. A circus or carnival sometimes has a place called the
“Funhouse,” or “House of **Mirrors** .” If you go in, there are lots of **concave** and
**convex** **mirrors** . When you look in these **mirrors**, you might not recognize
yourself! Your **reflection** is **distorted** . What makes that happen? Now you
know it’s **concave** and **convex mirrors** .

**Take-Home Letter**



Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing three of the seven spelling patterns for /ae/.
Your student learned to spell words with the /ae/ sound in second grade, so
this should be a review. Your student will be tested on these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _family_ and _young_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. Neither Challenge Word follows
the spelling pattern of /ae/.

The Content Word for this week is _straight_ . This word is directly related
to the material that we are reading in _Adventures in Light and Sound_ . The
Content Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student
would like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the
assessment. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit and try to
spell this word.

**Student Reader**





The chapters your student will read this week in _Adventures in Light and_
_Sound_ include information about refraction and lenses, color and light, what
sound is, and the characteristics of sound. Be sure to ask your student each
evening about what they are learning.

Students will take home text copies of the chapters in the Reader
throughout the unit. Encouraging students to read a text directly related to
this domain-based unit will provide content and vocabulary reinforcement.
Please remind your student that the glossary can be used for finding the
meaning of the bolded words.

**Color and Light**


Do you remember what color sunlight is? I hope you didn’t say, “No
color!” You learned that sunlight is white light. You also learned that instead
of being “no color,” white light is made up of all the colors of the rainbow.
Remember, the sun looks yellow because it gives off more yellow light than it
does the other colors.

You can prove that white light is really many colors if you have a wedgeshaped piece of transparent glass called a **prism** . If you hold a **prism** near
a sunny window, light will shine through and make a rainbow-like band of
colors. This shows that white light is really made up of all colors.

Do you remember what you learned about refraction? What happens
to light when it passes through something transparent like glass? The light
slows down and changes its path. A **prism** has a special shape that refracts
white light into all of the colors of the rainbow.

Have you ever seen a rainbow in the sky when the sun comes out after it
rains? Raindrops in the sky refract the light, just like a **prism** . This is what
creates the rainbow.

When white light is refracted, it often separates into a combination of
colors called the **spectrum** . The colors in the **spectrum** always appear in the
same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, **indigo**, and violet. These colors
are part of the visible light **spectrum** . They are the light waves that humans
can see. The colors of visible light are a result of differences in wavelength.
Red light has long wavelengths and violet light has short wavelengths.

You can remember the names of the colors in the visible light **spectrum**
in the right order if you can remember this funny name: “Roy G. Biv.” Each


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **87**


letter in that name stands for a color in the rainbow. Say it out loud. Try to
remember it!

Did you know that the color of any object depends on what light
wavelengths it reflects? Different objects absorb light wavelengths of some
colors, but reflect others. This is what creates color.

Blue jeans appear blue because something in the **material** reflects blue
light and absorbs all of the other light colors. Do you see anyone in your class
today wearing a red sweater? The sweater appears red because something in
the **material** reflects red light and absorbs all of the other light.

What about things that appear to be white? They look white because the
object reflects all of the white light wavelengths and doesn’t absorb any light.
Can you guess why something looks black? Things that appear black do not
reflect any light. They absorb all of the light wavelengths.

Remember that the colors we see are from light of specific wavelengths.
But, there is much more to light than just the wavelengths we can see. In fact,
visible light is only a small part of the energy waves that come from sunlight.

For example, on the shorter wavelength end of the light **spectrum**, there
are invisible **ultraviolet** light waves that cause sunburn. X-rays are even
shorter wavelengths of light. We can’t see these light x-rays but they can
travel through the human body. You learned in _How Does Your Body Work?_
that x-rays are used to create black and white photos of what’s inside the
body. Do you know of any other ways that x-rays are used?

Another type of invisible light is **infrared** waves. The wavelengths
of **infrared** light are longer than those of red light. These are the type of
light waves that you use when you click on the **remote control** to change
television channels!

**Take-Home Letter**



During the next several days, your student will be learning about the
properties of sound; how it travels in waves, like light; and how it can be
manipulated and used in certain devices. Your student will be introduced to
how sound is produced, how sounds change, the similarities and differences
between light and sound, and the parts of the human body that allow us to
speak. They will also learn about the work of Alexander Graham Bell, the
inventor of the telephone. Below are some suggestions for activities that you
may do at home to reinforce what your student is learning about in class.

**1. Sayings and Phrases: His Bark Is Worse Than His Bite/Actions Speak Louder**
**Than Words**

Your student will be learning the sayings “his bark is worse than his bite,”
and “actions speak louder than words.” Ask your student to explain what they
have learned about these phrases. Discuss with your student that the literal
meaning of the phrase “his bark is worse than his bite” is in reference to how
a dog is more likely to bark loudly and viciously than it is likely to injure
someone. The phrase can be used in reference to a person who may speak
loudly or harshly, but who is actually quite harmless. Talk with your student
about a time when you have used this phrase in reference to an animal or
person. Discuss with your student the meaning of “actions speak louder than
words.” Explain that actions are personified in this phrase, because actions
cannot physically speak. Discuss how the things we do can make more of
a statement than the things we say. Talk with your student about a time
when this phrase has been applicable to a situation you experienced. Find
opportunities to use these sayings.

**2. Sound Waves**

For this experiment, stretch some plastic wrap over the top of an empty
bowl. Sprinkle some dry rice grains or salt over the plastic wrap. Next, have


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **101**


your student clap their hands or take two nonbreakable objects and bang
them together over the bowl. The rice or salt should bounce every time the
objects bang together. Explain to your student that this experiment shows
how sound moves in waves. Discuss with your student how every time
hands are clapped or the objects are banged together, the sound waves move
through the air causing the plastic wrap to vibrate and the rice or salt to
bounce on the plastic wrap. You may wish to have your student write a brief
summary explaining what happened in the experiment and why.

**3. Bottle Music**

Use five identical glass or plastic bottles. Glass cola bottles would probably
work best for this experiment, but plastic will also be fine. Fill the bottles
with different amounts of water. Then, place the bottles in order from most
filled to least filled. After that, have your student blow across the top of a
bottle to create a sound. Have your student blow across a different bottle and
discuss the differences in pitch. Discuss with your student that this is how
certain musical instruments work, like an organ or flute. Discuss with your
student how the amount of air in the bottle affects the quality of sound that
is produced. These differences create a change in pitch. When there is more
air and less water in the bottle, the pitch is lower. A smaller amount of air in
the bottle, and more water, produces a higher pitch. The difference in pitch
creates variations in sound. You may wish to have your student write a brief
summary explaining what happened in the experiment and why.

**4. Words to Use**

Below is a list of some of the words that your student will be learning about
and using. Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with
your student.

continued




   - _cacophony_ —The car alarm created a cacophony because it was very
loud and harsh sounding, causing the dogs in the area to bark.

   - _frequency_ —If you are near a jet engine, you need to wear equipment to
protect your ears because of the very high frequency of the sound waves.

   - _medium_ —Sound waves travel more easily through a solid medium like
a brick wall than through a liquid medium like water.

   - _pitch_ —When we went to the opera, the singer on stage sang in a very
high pitch.

   - _receiver_ —A satellite dish is an example of a receiver because it receives
signals from satellites so that we can get different channels on our
television set.

   - _transmitter_ —The transmitter in my telephone broke, which made it
impossible for a person on the other end of the phone line to hear
anything that was said.

   - _variations_ —While singing or playing a musical instrument, one
can create smooth variations between sounds, or produce different
musical notes.


**5. Read Aloud Each Day**

It is very important that you read with your student every day. Set aside time
to read to your student and to listen to your student read to you.

Be sure to praise your student whenever they share what has been learned
at school.

**What Is Sound?**


An alarm clock rings, a dog barks, a voice calls, “Time to get up!” Every
day is full of familiar sounds but what exactly is sound?

Sound is caused by a back-and-forth movement called vibration. Try this.
Close your lips and hum. While you are humming, feel your throat under
your chin. Do you feel something buzzing or vibrating? What you feel is
caused by something moving back and forth very fast. When you hum, the
**vocal cords** in your throat vibrate back and forth. This makes the air around
them vibrate, which then creates the sound you hear.

Sound, like light, is a form of energy. Also like light, sound moves in
waves. **Sound waves** move out from a vibrating object, making the air move
back and forth in a way that we can’t see.

Two things must happen to create a sound. First, something needs
to vibrate and create **sound waves** . Then, something like air or another
**medium** needs to carry the **sound waves** . You hear sounds more clearly if
you are close to whatever is vibrating and making the **sound waves** . The
farther away that the **sound waves** spread out, the weaker they get. That is
why you can hear a friend standing right next to you better than if they are
calling to you from across the street

Sound travels not only through air, which is a gas, but through other
**mediums** . In fact, sound can travel through solids, liquids, and gases.

Think about sound traveling through solids, like a window or even a
closed door. If you are close enough, you can still hear sounds on the other
side of a window or door.

How about liquids? Have you ever been underwater in a swimming pool
when you have heard someone’s voice or another sound? It probably sounded


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **115**


different than it would if you were not underwater, but you were still able to
hear it. This is an example of sound traveling through a liquid—the water in
the pool.

One place that sound cannot travel is in outer space. Sound cannot travel
through the emptiness, or vacuum, of space. There is no sound in outer
space because there is no **medium** to carry it.

You might wonder about the speed at which sound travels. **Sound waves**
travel much slower than light waves. **Sound waves** travel at about 750 miles
per hour. That’s fast, but not close to the 186,000 miles per second that light
can travel. It would take a sound 33 hours to travel around Earth once _._
Remember that light can go seven times around Earth every second !

Here’s an example to prove that light travels faster than sound. Think
about the last time you were around a storm with thunder and lightning. Did
you notice that you saw each flash of lightning before you heard the clap of
thunder? That’s because light travels faster than sound!

The **medium** through which sound travels affects its rate of speed.
Interestingly, **sound waves** travel fastest through solids. In old western
movies, you may have seen a cowboy put his ear down to the steel railroad
tracks to hear if a train is coming. That is because the sound travels faster
through the steel than through the air.

Try this. Listen while you drum your fingers on your desk. Now, rest
your ear right on the surface of the desk and drum your fingers again. Which
way sounded louder?

The sound was louder when you put your head on the desk. This is
because the sound traveling through the solid wood of your desk traveled
faster than if it had first traveled through the air. Every time sound changes
**mediums**, it loses some of its loudness.

**Characteristics of Sound**


Let’s review what you have learned so far about sound by comparing
it to light. How is sound different from light? Sound must have a medium
to travel through—a solid, liquid, or gas. Light does not need a medium.
Remember, light can travel through the emptiness, or vacuum, of outer
space. Sound cannot.


The speed at which light and sound travel is also different. Light travels
much faster than sound.


There are important ways that light and sound are similar. They are both
forms of energy that travel in waves. There are also other similarities.


When you learned about light, you learned that light waves can be
different lengths. Some are long and some are short. It is the length of a light
wave that makes it appear to be a particular color.


Perhaps you are wondering whether sound waves differ from one
another. Imagine these two sounds—a baby crying for its mother and an

adult yelling. Both of these are sounds. The sound waves of each travel
through the same medium, air, so they are alike in that way. But a baby
crying surely sounds different than an adult yelling! The baby makes a high**pitched**, “screeching” sound. When an adult yells, it is a low- **pitched**, deep
tone. Could this difference in **pitch**, or how high or how low a sound is,
come from different kinds of sound waves?


The answer is yes and it has to do with the length of the sound waves!
It helps if we first understand how vibrations affect sound waves. Faster
vibrations produce shorter sound waves, which make sounds with a higher


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **123**


**pitch** . The baby’s screeching sound vibrates very rapidly, making shorter,
but more, sound waves. Can you think of some other sounds that have a
high **pitch** ?


Slower vibrations produce longer waves, which make sounds with a lower
**pitch** . A yelling voice makes longer, fewer waves so you hear a lower **pitch** .
**Pitch** describes the highness or lowness of a sound. Can you think of some
sounds that have a low **pitch** ?

Try changing your voice **pitch** . Can you speak in a high, squeaky voice?
Can you speak in a low, rumbling voice?


Sound also varies in loudness. If you’re listening to the radio and a
favorite song comes on, you might say, “Turn it up!” and reach for the knob
marked **VOLUME** .

When you turn up the **volume**, you are making the sound louder. A
scientist might say that you are increasing the sound’s **intensity** _._ More
**intense** sound waves carry more energy and make louder sounds.

How far away you can hear a sound depends on its **intensity** . A quiet
sound, like a whisper, doesn’t travel very far. A really loud sound can travel
for hundreds of miles. When fireworks are set off, the sound can be heard
miles away.

Very loud sounds can **damage** your hearing. People who work around
loud sounds all day long often wear ear coverings or plugs to protect their
hearing. You should be careful, too, not to turn the **volume** too loud if you
like to listen to music.

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing two of the seven spelling patterns for /ae/.
Your student learned to spell words with the /ae/ sound in second grade, so
this should be a review. Your student will be assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _another_ and _finally_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. Neither Challenge Word follows
the spelling pattern of /ae/.

**The Human Voice**


Have you ever noticed how well you know your mother or grandmother’s
voice? You have heard it so often that you can tell right away who it is. Each
person has a distinct voice. It’s a voice that can make many sounds with
different pitch and intensity. It can make high- and low-pitched sounds, loud
and soft sounds.


So how does your body make all of those different sounds? You already
know that something needs to vibrate to create sound waves. You also know
that sound needs a medium, like air, to travel through. Here’s how it works in
the human body.


Air passes in and out of your body all of the time when you breathe. Inside
your chest, your **lungs** expand to take in air and then contract to let it out.

Leading out of your **lungs** is a long tube called the **trachea**, or
“windpipe.” At the top of your trachea is another part of your body called the
**larynx**, or “voice box.”

Inside the **larynx** are two bundles of muscle that are known as vocal
cords. When you breathe in, the vocal cords relax so that air can move past
them and into your **lungs** . When you speak, you force the air out of your
**lungs** and over the vocal cords in your **larynx** . The vocal cords vibrate to
make waves in the air that continue up your throat and out of your mouth.


When you were a baby, you did not need to learn how to breathe. Your
**lungs** worked **automatically**, bringing air into and out of your body. You also
did not need to learn how to use your vocal cords to make sounds. When
you were a baby, you made lots of funny noises and grunts. Ask your parents!


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **129**


You did, however, need to learn how to change those grunts and noises
into words so you could talk. You did this by listening to the people who
talked to you when you were a baby. You practiced saying the same sounds
and words. You learned to speak whatever **language** all of those people were
speaking to you. If your family spoke only English to you, you learned to
speak English. If your family spoke only Spanish to you, you learned to speak
Spanish. People can learn to speak more than one **language** . Maybe you or
some of your classmates speak more than one **language** .


Your vocal cords grow as you grow. When you have shorter vocal cords,
you tend to speak at a higher pitch. This is why small children have higherpitched voices than adults. The pitch of your voice depends on the size of
your vocal cords and **larynx** .


The volume of your voice, or how loudly you speak, depends on how
much air is produced by your **lungs** and comes out of your mouth. When
more air is pushed out of your mouth, your voice will be louder.

**Tuning Forks**



ASSESSMENT
#### **14.1**



**Unit Assessment**



A tuning fork is not the kind of fork you use at the dinner table. It is a
fork you might use if you play a musical instrument.


If you strike a tuning fork on a hard surface, the two prongs of the fork
will begin to vibrate. That means they are moving back and forth very
rapidly. As the prongs vibrate, they give off a sound.


Every tuning fork is designed to vibrate at a certain speed, or frequency.
It’s the frequency that determines the pitch of the sound the fork makes. A
fork that vibrates fast makes a high-pitched sound. A fork that vibrates more
slowly makes a sound with a lower pitch.


Tuning forks make a very pure kind of sound. Most other things do not.
If you bang on a kitchen pot, it will make several sounds all at once. You will
hear the sound of the thick metal on the bottom of the pot vibrating. You will
also hear the sound of the thinner metal on the sides vibrating. You may even
hear the sound of the handle vibrating. Each of these parts of the pan will
give off a different pitch. The sound you will hear will not be a pure sound. It
will be a mix of several different pitches. Tuning forks are not like that. They
do not give off a mix of sounds. They emit, or send out, a single, pure sound.


Musicians use tuning forks to tune their instruments. A guitar player
can play a note on her guitar. Then, she can compare that note with the note
made by a tuning fork. If the note from the guitar sounds too high, she can
loosen the string. If the note sounds too low, she can tighten the string. Then,
she can try playing the note again.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **145**


Every tuning fork makes a specific pitch. For example, a tuning fork
might vibrate at 440 hertz. That means the vibrating prongs go through a
cycle of back-and-forth motion 440 times a second. Those vibrations make a
note that musicians call “A.”


This kind of tuning fork is widely used. It makes the same pitch as one of
the strings on a violin. It is used by musicians in orchestras to help them tune
their instruments before they play.


Suppose you wanted a higher pitch. You would need to get a tuning fork
with shorter prongs. The shorter the prongs, the higher the note.


Tuning forks also have other uses. Some ear doctors use them to check
hearing. Here is how it works. The doctor asks her patient to listen for
sounds. She then strikes a tuning fork where the patient can see her. She
waits to see if the patient hears the tone. If the patient cannot hear the sound,
that may mean there is a problem with the patient’s hearing.


Tuning forks are very useful tools.

**The Bell of Atri**


The town of Atri, in Italy, was famous for its bell. The bell hung in the
town square, where it had been placed many years before by an ancient king.


“If any man has been wronged,” the king proclaimed, “let him ring this
bell and a judge will appear.”


The people of Atri made use of the bell. Whenever a man felt he had
been wronged, he would ring the bell. Then, the judge would put on his
robes and make his way to the town square to investigate.


A braided rope hung from the bell. After a while, this rope began to wear
out. The braid broke apart into cords, and the cords themselves began to fray.


A farmer saw that the rope was about to give way. He cut grapevines
from his vineyard and wrapped the vines around the fraying rope.


While the farmer was mending the rope, an old knight was limping out
to his stable. In his youth, this knight had been an avid hunter. He had spent
many days on his favorite horse, sounding the horn and chasing wild boars.


These, however, were the pleasures of the knight’s youth. As he grew
older, he lost interest in hunting. He turned into a bitter, old miser. The old
knight was so stingy that he barely fed the horse who had served him so well
for many years. The poor animal stood all day in his stall, neglected.


At last, the old knight decided to get rid of the horse.

A farmer saw that the rope was about to give way. He cut grapevines

These, however, were the pleasures of the knight’s youth. As he grew

knight was so stingy that he barely fed the horse who had served him so well
for many years. The poor animal stood all day in his stall, neglected.



At last, the old knight decided to get rid of the horse.


“Why should I keep that old nag?” he said to himself. “He costs a fortune
to feed, and I don’t even need a horse anymore.”


The old knight limped out to his stable. He threw open the stable door
and drove the horse away.


“Get out!” he shouted. “Go and fend for yourself. I have no need for
you anymore.”


The old horse limped into town. The dogs barked at him and nipped at
his heels as he went. At last, he came to the town square, where the Bell of
Atri hung. The horse sniffed the rope. He smelled the grape leaves wrapped
around the old rope and began to nibble on the vines. The bell began to
swing from side to side.


Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, dong!


The judge heard the bell. He put on his robes and walked to the town
square. When he arrived, he found a horse standing beneath the bell and an
angry crowd gathered around.


“What is the meaning of this?” the judge asked.


“That’s the old knight’s horse,” said a man in the crowd.


“Just look at him!” said another. “It looks like the poor beast hasn’t been
fed in weeks.”


“The old miser never feeds him!” called another. “But look! The horse
has rung the bell! He is calling for justice!”


“Justice for the horse!” shouted the crowd. “Justice! Justice!”


The judge sent for the old knight.

“Sir Knight,” said the judge, “Shame on you! Where is your sense of

“Class,” said Mr. Brown, “today we are going to learn some
more about how our eyes work. James, would you please turn out
the lights?”


James walked to the door and switched off the lights. Mr.
Brown closed the blinds. It got darker in the classroom. It was not
completely black. Some light came through the blinds, but not very
much. The children giggled in the dimly lit room.


“Now,” said Mr. Brown. “I’d like all twenty-two of you to turn and
look at the person who sits next to you. Sally, you look at Mick. Jen,
you look at Stan. That’s it! Lean close and look your partner right in
the eyes. Can you see your partner’s pupils? Remember: the pupil is
the black part in the center of the eye. It’s the part that lets in light
from the outside world.”


Mr. Brown walked over to the door. “Can you all see your
partner’s pupils?”


“Yes!” said the students.


“Keep looking at your partner’s pupils!” said Mr. Brown.
Then, he turned on the lights. In an instant, the room went from
dim to bright.


Sally was staring at Mick’s pupils. She watched them shrink.

“Cool!” she called out. “Mick’s pupils got smaller when you
turned on the lights!”


“Sally’s did, too!” said Mick.


All around the room, students noticed the same thing. When the
lights came on, their partner’s pupils got smaller.


Mr. Brown explained: “The pupil’s job is to let light into the eye
and to keep it out. If it’s dark, your pupil opens wide to let in a lot
of light. If it’s bright, your pupil shrinks to let in less light. This is a
reflex. You don’t have to think, I believe I shall open my pupil a bit
wider. Your pupils work all by themselves, without you even thinking
about it. The pupil is like the gatekeeper of the eye. It decides what
gets in and what has to stay out.”


“Do it again!” shouted Mick. “Shut off the lights!”


“Okay,” said Mr. Brown. “Keep your eyes on your partner’s pupils.”


He threw the switch. Forty-four pupils grew larger in the dimness.


Mr. Brown waited a few seconds. Then, he turned the lights back
on. Forty-four pupils shrank in the bright light.


“So,” said Mr. Brown. “Do we understand what the pupils do?”


The students nodded their heads in agreement.
