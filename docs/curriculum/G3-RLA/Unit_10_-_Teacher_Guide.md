**Grade 3 | Unit 10**
#### Introduction


~~**ALL THAT JAZZ**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the unit _All_

_That Jazz_ . The Teacher Guide for _All That Jazz_ contains eleven daily lessons. Each lesson will require a

total of 120 minutes.


~~**WHY ALL THAT JAZZ IS IMPORTANT**~~


Students will learn about the vibrant music, poetry, and culture of the Jazz Age in the United States.

Students will learn about famous writers and musicians like Langston Hughes, Louis Armstrong, and

Billie Holiday. They will study how the jazz art form took root in the South, then spread to the North

to become the sound of the Harlem Renaissance, eventually connecting people around the world in

musical expression.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for students to

build content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions to

support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of History and Social Studies

Skills from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade level Social Studies

instruction. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine

the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


Students will perform guided research to further explore the history of jazz. They will develop research

skills and then use those skills to find deeper connections between the stories and music of the

Jazz Age. As students learn about the world of jazz, they will collaborate and share ideas with their

classmates. They will practice sharing feedback focused on their written work, and, at the end of the

unit, students will present their research to the group.


Students will dive into the rhythms and stories of jazz, utilizing the knowledge sequence in this unit to:


 - collaboratively generate research questions about jazz, jazz musicians, and the evolution of jazz music.


 - utilize Read-Alouds, independent reading, and partner reading to learn about the Jazz Age, the Harlem

Renaissance, jazz music, and biographies of celebrated jazz musicians and writers.


 - research the answers to their generated questions, gather information, write a short research essay

about a famous jazz musician, and give a presentation about their research.

~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


Underneath in regular font add: At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled

“Teacher Resources.” In this section you will find the following:


 - Measures of Text Complexity


 - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


 - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES**~~


The following Core Content Objectives are addressed in this unit:


 - Ask relevant questions and make pertinent comments


 - Identify details in texts


 - Determine key ideas of texts by evaluating details


 - Make text-based inferences


 - Generate questions based on prior knowledge and gathered information


 - Synthesize details across texts to demonstrate comprehension


 - Discuss and explain an author’s purpose

 - Present information using appropriate media


~~**END-OF-YEAR ASSESSMENT**~~


In this unit, an End-of-Year (EOY) Assessment is provided in addition to the 11 daily lessons. There
are three main group components of the assessment: a written assessment of silent reading
comprehension, a written assessment of grammar, and a written assessment of morphology. Two
other components, the oral reading of words in isolation and the fluency assessments, are optional
and administered one-on-one with students.


The written assessment of silent reading comprehension is meant to be completed in one
50-minute block. This should help approximate the extended end-of-year assessments that Grade
3 students may take. There are two passages for students to read and 10 questions after each
passage for students to answer.


Introduction
**3**


**4**



Students should remain seated and be encouraged to work diligently throughout the time
allotted for the assessment. You should circulate throughout the room, giving encouragement to
students; you should not, however, provide any assistance in reading or explaining any part of the
assessment. If students ask for help, simply say in a kind and encouraging voice, “I just want you to
do your very best. If you can’t figure something out, then come back to it later.”


The grammar and morphology assessments are meant to be completed during two 30-minute

blocks. Students should again be encouraged to do their very best work and remain seated while all

classmates finish.


One optional, oral portion of the End-of-Year Assessment evaluates skills in reading words in
isolation. Students will be asked to read words one-on-one as you mark their pronunciation using
Activity Page A.4. Explicit directions for the administration of this assessment are included in in the
End-of-Year Assessment section at the end of this Teacher Guide.


The optional fluency assessment is to be administered to students whose progress in fluency needs
to be monitored. The procedure established in previous units is to be followed. Instructions for the
administration of this assessment are included in the End-of-Year Assessment section at the end of
this Teacher Guide.


After administering the End-of-Year Assessment, you will complete an analysis summary of individual
student performance, using the Grade 3 End-of-Year Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2)
found in each individual student’s Activity Book. This summary should be passed on, along
with the completed assessments, to students’ teachers for the following school year. If reading
folders were kept for each student, this would be an ideal place to file the assessment and EOY
Assessment Summary.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR ALL THAT JAZZ**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _All That Jazz_ as they appear in the Read
Alouds, independent readings, and partner readings. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated

activity. The inclusion of words on this list does not mean that students are immediately expected to

be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout the

lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin to be able to use

some of them in conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students focus on research and inquiry using information from the texts in Read-Alouds,

biographical texts, passages, and information gathered collaboratively and independently. Students

learn to generate questions about texts, using individual Know-Wonder-Learn (KWL) charts to

scaffold the inquiry process. They synthesize background knowledge, wonderings, and learning to

generate research questions. Students learn how to make charts and webs that connect supporting

details to key ideas to enhance both their reading comprehension and their writing skills. They learn

how to compose an introductory paragraph and how to structure a short, informative essay. With

teacher support, students develop and follow a research plan. Throughout the unit, students will use

locally approved resources to identify and gather information from a variety of reliable sources. They

learn how to identify reliable sources and how to cite them in a works cited format. They also practice

paraphrasing and learn how to avoid plagiarism. Students will need regular access to locally approved

resources to explore their research topics. The culminating task is to build a multimedia presentation

that showcases their research topic. The oral presentation will have a 3–5 minute duration.


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing

within and across units:


- a research essay about a famous jazz musician, including a works cited page (collected and assessed

by teacher using the Grade 3 Informative Writing Rubric)


- a multimedia presentation that showcases a famous jazz musician (assessed by teacher using the

Grade 3 Presentation Rubric)


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving

appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete

activities in cursive throughout the unit. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

**Primary Focus:** Students will discuss what they know about jazz music and what

talent and creativity mean to them. ~~**[TEKS 3.1.A ]**~~


~~**INTRODUCTION AND ESSENTIAL TERMS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students they will begin a unit called _All That Jazz_, in which they will
become researchers on a journey to learn more about the jazz art form.
Explain that they will share and discuss what they learn about jazz with their
classmates throughout the unit. Explain that before starting the journey with
a Read-Aloud, they will talk about what they already know about jazz.


  - Ask students what they imagine or think about when they hear the word _jazz_ .
Have volunteers share their thoughts with the rest of the group.


**TEKS 3.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


- Show Image Card 1A-3 and ask students to describe what they see. What
instruments can they identify? What do they imagine the music being played
sounds like? Explain that the image shows a sculpture that can be seen in
Armstrong Park in New Orleans, a city known as the cradle of jazz.


- Ask students where they think jazz comes from. Have volunteers share their
thoughts with the rest of the group.


- Show Digital Projection DP.U10.L1.1, Map of the United States. Call on
students to point to the map and identify New Orleans, the Mississippi River,
St. Louis, Chicago, and New York City. Then, explain to students that the city
of New Orleans is known as the birthplace of jazz, and that during the Jazz
Age many great jazz musicians traveled from the southern part of the United
States up to northern cities like Chicago and New York City, where they could
find more work and were often treated better. Explain that many people
looking for work would travel up the Mississippi River by steamboat. Louis
Armstrong and other talented musicians played jazz music for audiences on
the steamboats.


- Show students Digital Projection DP.U10.L1.2, World Map. Explain that while jazz
originated in New Orleans and the southern part of the United States (point to
Louisiana), jazz music actually evolved from West African musical styles (point
to the West Africa region). Explain that when enslaved Africans were brought to
the Caribbean and the rest of the Americas, along with other free Africans who
came to these areas, they brought their music and other cultural traditions, and
this influence was part of the background for jazz music.


- Ask students to think about what kinds of music they like to listen to and who
their favorite musicians and singers are. After a pause, ask for volunteers to
share their thoughts with the rest of the group.


- Explain that some people have exceptional musical talent, or a natural
musical ability that can be developed. Tell students that in this unit they
will learn about some talented jazz artists, like Louis Armstrong and Ella
Fitzgerald, who could imitate musical instruments with their voices.


- Ask students: What do you think makes a great musician? Why do you think
your favorite musicians are great? What are their talents?


Check for Understanding


Ask students why we would want to learn about where a kind of music
comes from. Students should be able to respond that many things about
a style of music are determined by where it comes from.



Support


Have students refer to
another world map or
globe and identify West
Africa and the Caribbean
Sea. Then have students
identify New Orleans and
trace their finger up the
Mississippi River.

**What Is Jazz?**


**Show Image 1A-1:**
Improvising


Imagine you’re singing a song with two

friends. Close your eyes for a moment and

really feel what it would be like. Imagine the

rhythm of your feet tapping. Imagine your

three voices singing the melody.


Now imagine that one of your friends starts singing something different.

She’s making up a new melody, or tune. It’s not in the written music, but it

still sounds good. The notes she’s improvising, or making up from the top

of her head, still feel like they’re a part of the song. Suddenly, the same

old song the three of you have sung together for months sounds exciting

and new.


The experience you just imagined with your friends is a little bit of what it

might feel like to be a musician who plays jazz.


What is Jazz?


You might be asking, “What is jazz?” That’s

a hard question to answer! Louis Armstrong

was the famous jazz musician who wrote the

song “What a Wonderful World.” He once said,

“If you have to ask what jazz is, you’ll never

know.” What do you think he meant by that?

Even though the question is hard, let’s work together to answer it.


One way to explain jazz is to describe the qualities of the **genre** of music.

~~_A genre is a particular category or style of art. For example, jazz, hip-hop,_~~

~~_country, and rock are all genres of music._~~ Jazz songs are often written with

a particular rhythm called **swing** . They often involve solos by individual

performers. They also often involve improvisation. Yet just knowing these

facts doesn’t explain very much. After all, a song performed by Bessie Smith

doesn’t always sound like a song performed by Charles Mingus, even though

both musicians used swing rhythm, solos, and improvisation in their work.


Roots of Music Cultural Sculpture Garden in
Armstrong Park, New Orleans


Another way to explain jazz might be to say

where it came from, though that’s also a

hard answer to pin down! Jazz **evolved**, or

slowly turned into its current form, over time.

We know jazz started in part from drumming traditions and rhythms that

had been common in West Africa. During the time of slavery in the United

States, some plantation owners tried to prevent traditions like playing music.

However, slaves worked in secret to retain those musical traditions and

passed them down from generation to generation.


Because of this brave preservation, after the abolition and outlawing of

slavery in 1865, many Black Americans continued to play West African style

music. Over time, some musicians who lived in the city of New Orleans also

began to combine it with other musical traditions and this is when jazz truly

began. Instruments like trumpets and saxophones came from marching

band music. ~~_What other instruments do you think can be played to make jazz_~~

~~_music?_~~ ~~F~~ rom European church music, early jazz musicians took complex

**harmonies**, or notes that sound good when played at the same time, and

**scales**, or sets of notes that form harmonies. The Black American musicians

who first created jazz combined West African historical styles of music with

other types of music to create the musical style now called jazz. Over time,

that music began to spread far and wide beyond New Orleans as musicians

traveled first by steamboat up the Mississippi River, and later by train to

other towns and big cities across the United States.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


Scott Joplin


Another way to explain jazz is to talk about

some of the people who performed it. One of

the first jazz musicians that we know about

is this man, Scott Joplin. Joplin grew up in

Texarkana, located right on the border of

Texas and Arkansas. His mother sang and played banjo, and his father played

violin. As a boy, Joplin was fascinated by the music his parents played, and

he began to study the piano. A local musician, a German Jewish immigrant

named Julius Weiss, was so impressed by the young Joplin that he provided

free music lessons for several years, helping Joplin learn many different

musical genres. As an adult, he traveled the United States performing music

in the **ragtime** style. Ragtime is a very early form of jazz music that Joplin

learned from other Black musicians on his travels through the South. His

original ragtime songs, such as “The Entertainer” and “The Maple Leaf Rag,”

were popular throughout the United States. You can still hear them today.

~~_Where can you look for Scott Joplin’s songs and other examples of ragtime_~~

~~_music?_~~


Billie Holiday


Here’s another jazz singer named Billie

Holiday. When Holiday was a young girl living

in Baltimore, she heard recordings of Louis

Armstrong singing and playing jazz. Soon

she found herself following in his footsteps,

singing in nightclubs in Harlem, a historically Black neighborhood in New

York City. Harlem was the center of an artistic movement called the Harlem

Renaissance, and many Black writers, poets, artists, and thinkers lived and

worked there. Billie Holiday was one of them. ~~_What is an artistic movement?_~~

Holiday thought of her voice as a jazz instrument, and she incorporated

improvisation into her emotional singing. Some of her most famous songs

are “What a Little Moonlight Can Do” and “God Bless the Child.”

**Show Image 1A-6 Duke Ellington**
Duke Ellington


Here is a jazz musician named Duke Ellington.

Ellington grew up in Washington, D.C., in

the early 1900s. Even as a child, Ellington

had **elegance**, or manners and grace of the

kind royalty might have, which is why one

of his friends gave him the nickname “Duke.” ~~_A duke is an aristocrat, similar_~~

~~_to a prince._~~ Ellington started out playing ragtime piano, but he also added

many more instruments, including strings and horns. The sound he helped

create is called “big band,” because it took a big band to play it! Ellington

was an incredibly creative composer, and many of his songs remain jazz

**standards** today. ~~_A standard is a song that many musicians know or have_~~

~~_recorded._~~ Some of his songs include “Mood Indigo,” “In A Sentimental Mood,”

and “Take the A Train.” ~~_The A train is one of the New York subway trains that_~~

~~_goes to Harlem._~~


**Show image 1A-7 Dr. James Polk**
Dr. James Polk


Another jazz musician, Dr. James Polk, grew

up in Corpus Christi, Texas in the 1940s.

He and his family loved music. At eight

years old, Polk could already play multiple

musical instruments, such as the violin,

saxophone, and trombone. When he turned 13, Polk’s parents allowed him

to play with a local band. This is when he started playing “the blues”. ~~_Blues_~~

~~_music is typically written to express strong emotions and is played using the_~~

~~_harmonica, piano, guitar, drums, piano, etc.. The blues style of music heavily_~~

~~_influenced jazz music._~~ In 1958, Polk moved to Austin, Texas to attend college

where he earned a degree in music education. In 1978, famous singer Ray

Charles called Polk and asked if he would play the piano in the Ray Charles

Orchestra. This job put Polk on the map and over the next decade he became

not only the piano player but also a writer, arranger, and organist for the

group. In the 1990s, Polk began teaching music history and jazz studies

at Texas State. In 1999, Dr. Polk was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of

Fame. Dr. Polk continues to perform all over Texas today.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


Listening to Jazz


We’ve said a lot about where jazz comes

from and about some of the people who

helped create it. Do you feel like you really

understand jazz just from what we’ve said?

If you do, you might just make an amazing

jazz musician one day. But, for many of us, the only way to really understand

jazz is to listen to it! ~~_Would you recognize a jazz song if you heard it? Can you_~~

~~_imagine what a live jazz performance might be like?_~~


Keep that in mind as we move through this unit. We’ll read about some of

the most famous and interesting jazz musicians, and you’ll hear about their

music and the ideas and experiences they had that helped to inspire it. You’ll

learn more about the Harlem Renaissance, and you’ll research more about

specific performers you’d like to know more about. But remember, if you’re

not taking time to listen to jazz, you’re not really learning about it! Or, as

Duke Ellington put it, “It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing.”

~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that they may use their notes on Activity Page 1.1 to participate
in the class discussion about the Read-Aloud.


1. **Literal.** Name some jazz musicians.


» Answers may vary but could include Louis Armstrong, Scott Joplin, Billie Holiday,

Duke Ellington, or Dr. James Polk.


2. **Literal.** What are some typical qualities of the jazz music genre?


» Jazz songs often have a swing rhythm. They often feature solos by individual

performers and improvisation.


3. **Inferential.** What does it mean to improvise while singing or playing a song?


» To make or change the music in the moment while playing


4. **Inferential.** What kinds of instruments can be used to make jazz music?


» Answers may vary but could include trumpet, saxophone, piano, drums, clarinet,

bass violin, or other instruments.


5. **Inferential.** How did musical forms from Africa evolve into jazz?


» Musicians in New Orleans, after the abolition of slavery, combined West African

music with European musical components such as harmonic chords and a variety of

instruments which melded to form jazz music.


6. **Evaluative.** What helped jazz spread across the United States?


» Answers may vary but could include the Harlem Renaissance and people traveling

on trains and by steamboat to find more work.


7. **Evaluative.** What do the lives and stories of jazz musicians tell us about the
jazz art form?


» Answers may vary but could include that their stories tell us about why people

played jazz and how jazz has evolved.


~~**LISTENING TO JAZZ (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that they are going to listen to some jazz music. Explain that
jazz songs can be very long because a jazz improvisation can continue until
the musicians decide that it’s time to stop. They will hear two short audio clips.
Each clip is from a different version of the song “Summertime,” which is a jazz
standard, or a song that jazz musicians are expected to learn how to play.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


- Tell students to get together with their assigned partner.


- Tell students that they can close their eyes to help listen more carefully and
allow their imaginations to be filled with the music. They can imagine they
are at a live performance somewhere special, or just relax and let the music
guide their imaginations.


- Play the version of “Summertime” by Miles Davis for 1 or 2 minutes. You
can find audio for “Summertime” by Miles Davis through the Smithsonian
Folkways website or on another locally approved music streaming platform.


- Have one partner describe what they thought about or imagined while the
music played. Encourage students to use words and ideas they learned
from the Read-Aloud. Have the other partner respond with questions to help
clarify or understand the description in more detail.


- Play the version of “Summertime” by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald for
about 2 minutes. You can find this version through the Smooth Radio website
or on another locally approved streaming platform.


- Have partners switch roles for the same activity.


- Have students return to their individual seats or places in the classroom. Tell
students to think about how the two pieces of jazz music were similar and
how they were different. Give students a few moments to think about it.


- Ask for student volunteers to share how they think the songs were similar.


» Answers may vary but could include that they both have a soft drum beat, and in

both a horn is played.


- Ask for student volunteers to share how they think the songs were different.


» Answers may vary but could include that the horns sound different in each song,

and people sing in the second one.


Check for Understanding


After listening to the Read-Aloud and audio clips, ask students, “How is
jazz different from other music genres?” _(Jazz music does not sound like_
_rock and roll music because the instruments are played differently.)_



Challenge


Have students visit their
local library or record
store to find other famous
jazz tunes and write a
description of one
of their favorites.

what they learned from the Read-Aloud. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.13.A**~~


~~**DEVELOPING RESEARCH QUESTIONS (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that in this unit they will become researchers and present their
research to their classmates.


  - Explain that part of being a good researcher is asking questions that help
gather information. Affirm for students that it can be challenging to come up
with good questions that help us learn more about a topic.


  - Tell students that today they will learn about how to ask questions that can
guide research. Ask, “What is research?”


» Research is the process of asking questions and gathering information to learn

new things.


  - Model how to ask questions that would help a researcher learn more about
the song “Summertime.”


  - Say, “There are many things we could ask about the song ‘Summertime.’ In
order to learn more about a topic, it is often helpful to ask questions about
history or background first. For example, when was the song ‘Summertime’
written? Who wrote it?”


  - Say, “We can ask other questions about the song based on what we already
know. We know that at least two versions of the song exist: one by Miles
Davis and the other by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. Based on this
information, we can ask, ‘Are there other well-known musicians that have
made versions of the song ‘Summertime’? If so, who?’”


  - Show students that by searching for information in locally approved
resources, you were able to find out that the song “Summertime” was written
by George Gershwin in 1934, and that Dubose Heyward wrote the lyrics, or
the words to the song. Tell them that while researching, you discovered that
the song was originally written for an opera called _Porgy and Bess_ .


  - Explain to students that researchers learn a lot about their topic, often
beyond the answers to the questions they asked to begin their research.
First, though, it is important to think about questions to guide the research.

 - Tell students that by searching for information in locally approved resources,
you learned that versions of the song “Summertime” have been made by
many famous musical artists. It became a popular song when Billie Holiday,
who is featured in the Read-Aloud, made her version in the 1930s. Since then,
other versions have been made by other well-known musicians and musical
groups, like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald (1957), Miles Davis (1958),
Janis Joplin (1969), Sublime (2006), and Willie Nelson (2016).


 - Explain that Willie Nelson and Janis Joplin are not jazz musicians, but they
were greatly influenced by jazz music. Explain that jazz music has been very
influential for other genres of music, like folk, pop music, and hip-hop.


 - Tell students that during this unit they will be researching different jazz
musicians. They will each use an individual Research Notebook for the
duration of the unit. In this notebook, they will write and keep track of
their questions, the information they gather, and all things related to their
Research Plan and Final Presentation.


~~**INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that today students will only be developing questions, though they
will have the opportunity to practice researching information in future
lessons. Tell students that they should think about one of the people or
places they learned about today and write their research questions in the
bottom section of Activity Page 1.1.


 - Have students review their notes on Activity Page 1.1. Explain that having
some knowledge about a topic helps a researcher ask more interesting, indepth questions about it.


 - Have students select one image or topic that they would like to learn
more about.


 - Walk around the room and confirm that each student has chosen an image.


 - Display and point to Image 1A-6 or to the image of Duke Ellington on Activity Page 1.1.


 - Remind students that Duke Ellington played ragtime before he started
playing a style called “big band” with lots of other musicians. Remind
students that he composed many famous songs.


 - Tell students that based on these details, we can ask the big questions: How
did Duke Ellington become the leader of a big band? Who were they and how
did they become famous?


 - Have students write one or two questions about what interests them most
about the image they chose. Explain that they do not have to ask questions
about everything in the image. Affirm that there may be one person or thing
in particular that they want to know more about.

  - When students finish writing, ask: “What kind of punctuation mark should be
at the end of sentences that ask a question?” _(question mark)_


  - Tell students to check that each question they wrote has a question mark at
the end. If it does not, have students revise. Then, have students check their
sentences for correct capitalization and subject/verb agreement.

    - _How are the things you and your partner are asking about similar? How_
_are they different?_


    - _After hearing your partner’s questions, are there other questions you_
_could ask?_


  - Give students 3 minutes to share and give feedback with a partner who
chose the same image. Then have students switch partners to work with
someone who chose a different image.


  - Explain to students that asking new questions about a topic—which could
be something, someone, a place, or an idea—helps us think about the topic

Lesson 4 Billie Holiday, also known as Lady Day
**59**


**60**



**“Lady Day”**


When Eleanora Fagan was a little girl,

her mother worked and worked, and

she dreamed about buying a house for

the two of them. From Philadelphia they

moved to Baltimore. There, little Eleanora

had to live with her grandmother and

some cousins for a while, without her mother. Times were very tough,

and her mom had to find more work. Before she was even ten years

old, Eleanora went to work, too. She cleaned houses and swept stairs

throughout the neighborhood to save money to help her mom. ~~_How_~~

~~_do you think Eleanora felt about having to do this work?_~~


**Show Image 4A-2**

She also visited a special house, her

friend Alice’s house. There, Alice let

Eleanora listen to music on a record

player. She loved to listen to songs by

Louis Armstrong. She loved his voice and

the way he played the trumpet. Her ears

and heart were filled with stories of her family, of their struggle and

difficult experiences and with the melodies of ragtime and swing.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


**Show Image 4A-3**

Eleanora was fascinated by creating, and

she wanted to live an artistic life. She

tried to soak up art any way she could.

She loved movies, and wanted to see

movies featuring her favorite actress,

Billie Dove. She decided she would take

an **artistic** name, and that everyone would call her Billie Holiday like

the name of her favorite actress. ~~_Is there an actor or a performer who_~~

~~_you admire? What would your artistic name be?_~~


Finally, Billie’s mom saved enough

money to buy a house with many rooms

to rent and the two could be together

again. But, Baltimore only brought them

trouble, and soon Billie ended up living

apart from her mother again, this time

in a Catholic home for girls. It was a place full of cold and hunger,

but the nuns who took care of her also taught her religious music

and how to play the organ. Even as a child in the middle of these

difficulties, Billie had strength, style, and grace. She also had sadness

in her heart, and only music could comfort her. ~~_Is there a time when_~~

~~_music has meant something very important to you?_~~


**Show Image 4A-5**

When she was able to leave, her

mother decided it was time for them

to move to New York City. Billie and her mother moved to Harlem, a

neighborhood in New York City where many Black intellectuals and

artists lived. There weren’t many jobs, though, and everyone needed

work. Billie’s mom had worked very hard for many years, and now she

was tired and getting sick. So Billie looked everywhere in Harlem for

a job to help support them both. One evening, when she was feeling

very worried and **desperate**, a pianist outside a restaurant asked her

if she could sing. Young Billie didn’t think about it twice and said “Yes.”

Without even an **audition**, she took the stage. New York City had

found Billie Holiday.


**Show Image 4A-6**

Sometimes it’s in the middle of difficult

times when people’s voices stand out the

most. The jazz musicians playing at the

start of the twentieth century did more

than play songs. They brought poetry

and thought to life with their music, and

they encouraged and supported their communities. Even among jazz

musicians, though, Billie Holiday’s voice was something special. Her

voice moved Harlem’s heart.


**Show Image 4A-7**

Billie soon got to know several well
known jazz musicians. They all wanted

to make music with her, and she began

to travel and sing with them on the road.

The life of a musician was not easy, and

Billie had to work every night on stage.

~~_In what ways would it be challenging to be on the road and on stage_~~

~~_all the time?_~~ But Billie knew the jazz world had its doors open for her,

and she dedicated herself to singing and making magic happen on

the stage.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


**Show Image 4A-8**

Even after finding fame, Billie never had an easy life. But she had

many friends and countless fans. One of them, Lester Young, was a

marvel on the saxophone. He and Billie loved to play music together

and became great friends. Lester gave Billie another name, one with a

touch of nobility. He called her Lady Day. Today, the voice of Lady Day

is one of the most **iconic** of all time.


~~**LISTENING TO JAZZ (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students to continue to work on columns two and three of the KWL chart
as they listen to a song sung by Billie Holiday.


                   - Tell students that they will listen to a clip of

 - Explain to students that most introductory paragraphs include, in no
particular order:


1. an opening statement or hook


2. a topic sentence that introduces the central idea of the text


3. some key details


 - Explain to students that the opening statement, or “hook,” is a sentence that
grabs the reader’s attention. The hook can be an interesting fact or an open
question that invites the reader to start thinking about the topic.


 - Explain to students that a topic sentence is usually about the big idea the
author wants to convey.


 - Explain to students that the details included in the paragraph should support
either the opening statement (or hook) or the topic sentence.


 - Show Digital Projection DP.U10.L4.1: Example of an Introductory Paragraph.

) **Example of an Introductory Paragraph**


 - Ask students to identify the opening statement or hook.


» “No one could move a room like Bessie Smith.”


 - Explain to students that this is an assertive statement that grabs the
reader’s attention.


 - Ask students to identify the introductory topic sentence in the paragraph.


» “Her power, talent, and grit made her legendary.”


 - Explain to students that this sentence does not contain specific details, but
rather key ideas that could be explained in more detail.


 - Ask students to identify the details in the paragraph.


» “Her voice could fill an opera house without a microphone and shake people up.

Bessie Smith lost both of her parents when she was still a child, but she believed

in herself and eventually became one of the most successful and highest paid

blues singer of her time.”


 - Tell students that these are details that support the opening statement and
the introductory topic sentence.



Support


Ask students to consider
the sentence “She was
legendary.” Why is this
an idea and not a detail?
_(In order to be true,_
_the sentence “She was_
_legendary” needs to be_
_supported by details._
_Details give specific,_
_factual information.)_

Challenge


Challenge students to
write their paragraph in a
different tone than that of

the Read-Aloud. Explain
to students that the tone

of a text is like the mood

of text, and the tone of
the Read-Aloud is dreamy

and a little sad. Affirm for

students that they could
write about the same topic

in an excited, proud, or

even angry way.

~~**WRITING AN INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students go back to their KWL charts and review the details they
highlighted earlier in the lesson.


  - Have students take out Activity Page 4.2. Review each section of Activity
Page 4.2 with the students.


  - Have students review the details they underlined or highlighted in their KWL
chart. Tell students to write the details they underlined or highlighted under
“Details” on Activity Page 4.2.


  - Remind students that details support key ideas. Ask students what key idea, or
ideas, about Billie Holiday can be determined from the details they gathered.


  - Have students write an introductory topic sentence and an opening
statement for their introductory paragraph about Billie Holiday.


  - Tell students to fill out the top section of Activity Page 4.2. Tell students to
review the example on Digital Projection DP.U10.L4.1 for ideas if they get stuck.


  - Walk around the room and help students as needed.


  - Tell students to use what is in the top section of Activity Page 4.2 to write an
introductory paragraph in the space below. Explain to students that linking
words like _so, also, and, but,_ and _because_ can help them put the pieces
together and write a paragraph that makes sense.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


  - Walk around the room and help students as needed.


Check for Understanding


Ask students what the difference is between an opening statement and
a topic sentence. Students should be able to explain that an opening
statement draws the reader in and a topic sentence tells the reader what
the paper will be about more generally. If they cannot, review the example
again with the group.

  - Example: Marcela went to her friend’s house.


» “Marcela” is the subject and “went to her friend’s house” is the predicate.


  - Explain to students that a compound sentence will have more than one
subject or more than one predicate.


  - Example: The school and the library are open today.


» ”The school and the library” is the compound subject and “are open today” is the

predicate. “The school and the library” is a compound subject because there is

more than one subject.

to students that simple
sentences are often used
to make strong points.


**68**




 - Example: Nico was too tired to finish his homework and practice playing
guitar.


» “Nico” is the subject and “was too tired to finish his homework and practice

playing guitar” is the compound predicate. The predicate links more than one verb

to the subject, so it is a compound predicate.


 - Have the students take out a blank sheet of notebook paper. Have the
students write these sentences down as you say them orally:


1. The fire crackled in the fireplace all morning.


2. Ricardo and Nelly walked into the wrong classroom by mistake.


 - Tell students to circle the subject and underline the predicate in each
sentence. Then, write S next to the sentence if it is a simple sentence, or C if
it is a compound sentence.


» The first sentence is a simple sentence. The subject is “The fire” and “crackled in

the fireplace all morning” is the predicate.


» The second sentence is a compound sentence. “Ricardo and Nelly” is a

compound subject.


~~**MAKING REVISIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that varying sentence structure can help express ideas
more clearly. We don’t always talk in simple sentences, so why would we
always write in simple sentences?


 - Have students read their introductory paragraphs and underline the
simple sentences.


 - Explain to students that sometimes rewording, combining, or reordering
sentences can improve the flow of a paragraph. Remind students that
linking words like also, so, and, but, and because can help connect ideas
in their writing.


 - Have students read their introductory paragraph on Activity Page 4.2. Ask
students to think about ways they might improve the sentence structure in
their paragraph. Ask them to think about where they could add more details
within the sentences.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READING (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ensure that each student is able to view and read the book _Benny Goodman_
_and Teddy Wilson: Taking the Stage as the First Black and White Jazz Band in_
_History_ by Lesa Cline-Ransome.


  - Tell students that in this lesson they will read about jazz musicians Teddy
Wilson and Benny Goodman. Teddy was African American, and Benny was
white.


  - Tell students that today, people from all over the world of different races,
ethnicities, and backgrounds get together to play jazz music. That is not
how it was in the United States before the civil rights movement. Explain to
students that in the 1930s and 1940s, when the Benny Goodman Trio was
rising to fame, segregation laws in some places prevented black people and
white people from performing together.


  - Benny Goodman was Jewish. When he was a boy, his parents were very hard
working, but poor. His dad enrolled him in music lessons that were offered
at their local synagogue. The Jewish music teachers who taught Benny also
taught African American students at the same time. Many people of the
Jewish faith have worked to end segregation in our country’s history. With
this upbringing, as Benny grew up, he wanted to play alongside talented
musicians, regardless of their race.


  - When Benny Goodman and Teddy Wilson played together, they knew they
had something special because people came to hear them play even though
they were one of the first bands to include white and black musicians
performing together. Nowadays musicians of all types work together, but
back then it was very different. The Benny Goodman Trio was important
since they showed people could work together to make great music
regardless of their background.


**TEKS 3.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words and multiplemeaning words; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces

 - Explain to students that every book is unique, and sometimes authors
choose to use language very differently because they want to tell the story
with a certain tone of voice.


 - Tell students that during and after the reading, they will discuss how the
author’s unique use of language creates a certain tone, and why she chose to
write the story that way.


~~**PRESENTING THE READING (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Read aloud pages 1–11 of _Benny Goodman and Teddy Wilson: Taking the Stage_
_as the First Black and White Jazz Band in History_ . Pause at certain points
during the reading to clarify key ideas and core vocabulary. Give students
opportunities to express comprehension and reflection as they follow along.


 - Pause after reading pages 1–3, and ask students what they notice about the
punctuation in the text. Where are the periods?


» There are no periods in the text, only commas.


 - What do the words _pop boom pop boom_ make you think of?


» Answers will vary but could include a drum.


 - Ask students why they think the author uses words like _pop boom pop boom_
and _tweet drum chirp tweet drum chirp_ .


» Answers will vary but could include that the author uses these words because

they imitate music or the beat of a drum.


 - Explain to students that words like _pop boom pop boom_ are examples of
onomatopoeia. Write the word _onomatopoeia_ on the board in cursive and
repeat it. Onomatopoeia is when a word sounds like what it means or the
action it describes. For example, _tick-tock_ sounds like a clock and describes
the action of a clock.


 - Ask students if they can identify another example of onomatopoeia on page

3.


» ting ping tap ting ping tap


 - Tell students that this story is written in the style of a song or a poem, but it
still gives us information about Benny Goodman and Teddy Wilson.


 - Point to the header on page 1 and ask students where Benny grew up.


» Chicago, Illinois


 - Point to the header on page 3 and ask where Teddy grew up.

porch), and ask students what Benny and Teddy had in common growing up.


» Answers may vary but could include that they both had parents who kept them

out of trouble and taught them to appreciate music. They also both learned to

play instruments when they were young, along with their brothers.


- Pause after reading page 7 (with the silhouette of Benny playing the clarinet
in the window), and ask what Benny and Teddy learned from their tutors.
(Note the repetition of the word _tutors_ in the text.)


» Answers may vary but could include that they received formal instruction from

their tutors. (Benny learned German styles of music, and Teddy learned overtures,

Chopin, and Bach.)


- On the same page, read the last line of the first paragraph and the last line of
the second paragraph. (They are the same.)


- Ask students which style of music both men loved to play the most?

» “Black and blues, mellow and loose.”


- Ask students what kind of music that describes.

» jazz


- Continue reading and displaying illustrations for students. Pause after

the summertime to be like.


- Have students turn to page 17 of the book _Benny Goodman and Teddy Wilson:_
_Taking the Stage as the First Black and White Jazz Band in History_, which
portrays Gene Krupa on drums in a recording studio. Read aloud pages 17–
21. Give students opportunities to respond and reflect as they follow along.


- Pause after reading page 17, which shows Gene Krupa on drums in a
recording studio, and ask students what that page is about. What happens?

» Answers will vary but could include that Benny and Teddy meet and discover that

they play jazz really well together. They form a trio with a drummer, Gene Krupa,

and make records, together becoming the Benny Goodman Trio.


- Pause after reading page 19 and ask students who the members of the
original Benny Goodman Trio were.

» Benny Goodman, Teddy Wilson, and Gene Krupa


- What happened when Teddy started to play in front of audiences, too?

» Answers will vary but could include that the audiences grew and cheered for

the trio.

important facts and details to support key ideas about their topic.


 - Ask students what the difference is between a key idea and a detail. Give the
students an opportunity to respond, and then provide a clear example of the
difference between a key idea and a detail.


» For example, a key idea about Louis Armstrong is that he is well known for more

than his musical performances. Two details that support this key idea are that he

traveled the world as an ambassador and he wrote his own music.


 - Tell students that it is time for them to become researchers. Explain to
students that you will help them develop their Research Plan. Tell students
that they will use their research skills, which they have already been
practicing. Tell students that at the end of the unit, they will present their
research to the rest of the class.

they will gather information from reliable sources and use the information to
write a short informative essay about each musician.


 - Explain to students that they will ask questions before they research, while
they research, and after they research to reflect on how the musician
influenced or was influenced by jazz. When their research is complete, they
will create a fun presentation to share with the class.

Explain to students that they will do some initial research about the famous
jazz musician that interests them the most. Then they will decide on their
research topic.


 - Tell students that they may choose to learn more about a famous jazz
musician that has been introduced in the unit, or a different famous jazz
musician they would like to research, such as Count Basie or Dave Brubeck.


 - Have students create two sections in their Research Notebooks, a Notes
section and a Drafts section.


 - Explain to students that the Notes section of the Research Notebook is to
keep an organized record of all the information they gather as they research,
and ideas that develop.


 - Tell students to always put the date at the top of the page when they begin to
take notes, and to always write down the correct information for Works Cited.


 - Have students put the date at the top of a fresh page in the Notes section of
their Research Notebook. Tell students to make a chart. Have students write
“Famous Jazz Musician” at the top. Tell students to write down notes about
three or four musicians as they explore topics they find interesting.


 - Remind students to look for reliable sources of information for their research.
Tell students to identify reliable sources of biographical information, or
appropriate information about specific musical styles. Walk around the
research space to ensure that students are finding reliable and appropriate
sources of information.


 - Give students time to do some exploratory research about famous jazz
musicians that interest them. Tell them to take notes about the musicians’
lives and their music in the chart.


 - Ask students to review their notes and choose the musician they want
to learn more about. Have students write the musician’s name in their
individual Research Plans (Activity Page 5.1).


 - Tell students that if they already have some big questions about their topic,
they can write them in the Notes section of their Research Notebook for now.
They will complete the next part of their Research Plan in the next lesson.


**Note:** If students need more time to decide on their topic, they can explore
more in locally approved resources or at the library, and then make their final
decisions before the next lesson.

~~**PEER FEEDBACK (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Divide students into groups of three or four. Ask students to bring their
Research Plans with them to the group work space.


 - Have students take turns sharing their research topics with each other. Have
students give feedback about the musician each of their peers chose to
research. Provide the following questions to help guide their discussion:


   - _Can you think of anything that the musicians you and your peer chose to_
_research have in common?_


   - _Can you think of anything you know, or would like to know, about the_
_musician your peer chose to research? If so, share your ideas and_

**94**



~~**PARAPHRASING (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that there are a couple rules to paraphrasing.


 - Tell students that the first rule of paraphrasing is that you cannot use the
exact same words as the original author. When you use the same words as
the author, you must put those words in quotation marks. Quoting someone
is not paraphrasing. Both can be used when writing a research paper.


 - Tell students that the second rule is that you cannot leave out important
information when you are paraphrasing someone else’s words. That would be
giving incomplete or inaccurate information. You can, however, leave out the
less important details.


 - Have students take out a sheet of notebook paper and write their name
at the top. Tell students that they will hear two parts from the book again
and they will paraphrase each one. Have students number 1 and 2 on their
notebook paper, with several lines in between. Explain that after they hear
each paragraph, they will have 3 or 4 minutes to write down what happens in
the paragraph in their own words. Tell students that the paragraphs can be
paraphrased in one or two sentences.


1. Read the first 5 pages of _Tito Puente, Mambo King_ and give students time

to paraphrase them.


» Possible response: Tito Puente loved to play music even as a child, so his mother

started him in music lessons.


2. Read the section about Tito becoming King of the Stars. Ask students to

paraphrase the events that led to this.


» Possible response: Tito Puente danced and won King of the Stars at his church’s

festival. He ultimately won four times.


 - Collect student papers when they are finished.

~~**CAPITALIZATION AND PUNCTUATION (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Review the rules of capitalization with students. Remind students that we always
capitalize proper nouns, or the names of people, places, and things. We also
always capitalize the pronoun _I_ and the first letter of the first word in a sentence.


  - Remind students that we also finish sentences with correct punctuation,
like a period, a question mark, or an exclamation point, depending on the

**Primary Focus:** Students will identify primary and secondary sources to use for

their research about a famous jazz musician. ~~**TEKS 3.13.D**~~


~~**DEVELOPING QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students to take out their individual Research Notebooks and their
Research Plans (Activity Page 5.1).


  - Remind students that in the previous lesson they decided on which
historically famous jazz musician they are going to research and write about
for their final presentation.


  - In their Research Notebook, they should already have some basic
information written down about the famous jazz musician they chose.
Confirm this with students and explain that they will have an opportunity to
gather more information in this lesson.


  - Remind students that good researchers know how to ask big questions
based on what they already know. A big question will turn into a central idea.
Questions about specific information help provide supporting details.


  - Remind students of the Read-Aloud in Lesson 4 where they learned about
Billie Holiday’s childhood and how she came to New York, was embraced by
the jazz community, and became famous. Based on what we already know,
we could ask the big question: _How did Billie Holiday inspire people?_


  - Tell students that in this lesson they will think about what they want to know
about the jazz musician they chose and develop questions to guide their
research. Remind students that as they gather more information, they may
have more questions about what they learn.


~~**FINDING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RESOURCES (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that during their time for independent research, they will
identify one or two primary sources for their research. Explain that a primary
source is where the researcher gathers most of their key information.


  - Explain to students that secondary sources of information are used to
confirm and expand on the information they find in the primary source or

sources. Explain that secondary sources often contain interesting details
or unique perspectives, or points of view, on the information found in a
primary source. Tell students they will find one or two secondary sources of
information for their research.


- Explain that for their informative research papers, they will need at least
two sources, but could use up to four: one or two primary sources, and one
or two secondary sources. Ask students what would make a good primary
source for researching a famous jazz musician.


» a biography about that musician, which could be a book or an article


- Remind students that their sources must be reliable. Tell students that
during their independent research time, they can ask for help to determine
whether or not a source is reliable.


- How should we record which sources we use to gather information?


» Answers should indicate listing their sources in the Works Cited format they

learned and practiced in Lesson 3.


- Show Digital Projection DP.U10.L3.1. With the students, review the
information they need for each source that will be listed on their Works
Cited page. Tell students that when they are researching, they will write their
sources down in this format in the notes section of their Research Notebook.
Explain that they will need this information to complete a Works Cited page
for their research paper.

Check for Understanding


Ask students why a biography about the person they are researching
would be a good primary source of information. _(Biographies are_
_nonfiction texts that tell true stories about people.)_


Unit 10 All That Jazz


~~**INDEPENDENT RESEARCH (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students go to the Notes section of their Research Notebook and
review the information they wrote down about the jazz musician they chose
to research. Give students about 5 or 6 minutes to generate one or two
questions they have about their topic. Tell students to ask a question that
requires more than one detail to answer. Tell students to write down their
questions on a fresh page in their notebooks.


 - Walk around the room and help students as needed. Verify that students’
questions are appropriate for their topics.


 - Tell students to record their questions in their Research Plan (Activity
Page 5.1) in the space provided.


**Note:** If students do not have enough information to develop questions,
direct them to their research stations and explain that they may write their
questions once they have more information about their topic.


 - Have students go to their research stations. Tell students that they will use
this time for independent research. Tell students to use the questions they
just wrote down to guide their research.


 - Tell students that today they will identify at least one primary source and
one secondary source for their research. They will also take notes on the key
information and details they find about their topic.


 - Tell students to record the name of the primary source of information on
a page in the Notes section of their Research Notebook. Tell students to
record it as it should appear on their Works Cited page. Tell students to write
down the key information they find directly below the name of the source of
information.


 - Explain to students that they may write down quotes or paraphrase the
information they find. Remind students to evaluate details to determine
key ideas.


 - Tell students that once they have identified a primary source and gathered
some key information, they can search for a secondary source to confirm
and expand on what they found.


 - Walk around the room and visit students’ research stations to support

**Primary Focus:** Students will synthesize information to create new understanding

by comparing and contrasting the stories of Millo Castro Zaldarriaga and



Tito Puente.



~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.6.H**~~



~~**INTRODUCING THE READING (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ensure that each student is able to read the text and view the illustrations
in the book _Dream Drum Girl, How One Girl’s Courage Changed Music_ by
Margarita Engle. Tell students that they will listen and follow along as you read.


  - Explain to students that this book is written in a poetic form, like others they
have read in the unit. Explain to students that this book tells the story of
Millo Castro Zaldarriaga, a woman of Cuban, Chinese, and African descent,
who became a famous drummer. She was raised on the island of Cuba in the
1920s and 1930s, during the height of the Harlem Renaissance in the United
States. Jazz sounds were alive on her island home, too.


  - Display Digital Projection DP.U10.L1.2.

) **Map of the World**


  - Point to Cuba on the map. Then point to Havana, Cuba, and explain to
students that this is where Millo Castro Zaldarriaga and her ten sisters
started their famous all-girl orchestra, Anacaona.


  - Remind students that jazz music has influenced many other forms of music
in the United States and in other parts of the world. Jazz music has also been
influenced by other cultures and forms of music, like Afro-Cuban music.
Afro-Cuban musical traditions include rhythms on bongó drums, the conga
drums, and the timbales. Musicians have blended Afro-Cuban styles with
American blues and jazz to create new sounds. Millo Castro Zaldarriaga and
her sisters were some of the first musicians to do this. Tito Puente was, as well.


  - Ask for a student volunteer to point to the region of West Africa on the map.
Ask students what they remember about West Africa and jazz music.


» Jazz evolved from West African music.


  - Point to Havana, Cuba again, and explain to students that West African music
also evolved into both Afro-Cuban music and the music of Millo Castro
Zaldarriaga and her sisters.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thougts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words;
**TEKS 3.6.H** Synthesize information to create new understanding.


Lesson 7 Dreaming with Music
**105**


**106**




 - Ask students if it makes sense that jazz and Afro-Cuban music connect
through West African sounds.


» Yes, because slaves from West Africa were brought to the Caribbean islands,
including Cuba, so it makes sense that the musical tradition from Africa would
influence Caribbean music like it would Jazz in America.


 - Pause and ask students if they can remember a time when they knew they
could do something, but were told they couldn’t. After acknowledging
student responses, explain that Millo Castro Zaldarriaga was told that she
couldn’t play drums because she was a girl. But Millo knew that not only
could she play the drums, she could play them well.


 - Ask students to imagine what it was like for Millo to dream of playing the
drums, as they listen to the story.


~~**PRESENTING THE READING (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Read the trade book _Drum Dream Girl: How One Girl’s Courage Changed_
_Music_ by Margarita Engle aloud to the class.


 - Pause at certain points during the reading to clarify key ideas and core
vocabulary. Give students opportunities to respond and reflect as they
follow along.


 - Pause after reading page 4, which has a smiling moon in the illustration, and
ask students which island is the “island of music” in the story.


» Cuba


 - Pause after reading page 10, which has a big green parrot in the illustration,
and ask students what the author means when she says that the little girl
could hear her own music.


» Answers may vary but could include that the little girl heard the sounds of drums

in her imagination, as though she was making music too.


 - Pause after reading page 16, which has a red dragon in the illustration, and
ask students if they think that drums and drummers played a big part in
the carnival.


» Yes, because the book talks about dancers and drummers in costumes.


 - Pause after reading page 21, which shows the girl playing drums with the
moon, and ask students why they think the author compares the timbales to
the moon.


» Answers may vary but could include that timbales are round and white like the

moon, or that the moon comes out at night when the little girl is dreaming of

playing drums.


 - Pause after reading page 26 and ask students how they think Millo felt when
she was asked to join her sister’s band.


» Answers may vary.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


  - Pause after reading page 28, which shows the girl and her sister looking
disappointed, and ask students how they think Millo felt when her father said
she couldn’t play, even though she’d been practicing on her own and her
sisters wanted her to join the band.


» Answers may vary but could include students’ thoughts and feelings about it

being unfair for her father to say she couldn’t play because she was a girl.


  - Give students time to look through the illustrations and the photos in the book.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READING (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** What would it be like to be a drummer in a carnival parade?


» Answers may vary but should include students’ thoughts about what a carnival is

like and what performing at a carnival would be like.


  - Tell students that the Latin jazz band Anacaona became world famous and
Millo and her sisters performed in many countries.


2. **Evaluative.** Do you think Millo inspired people? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary but should include students’ thoughts about how Millo inspired

people, perhaps especially women and girls, and other drummers, in general.


Check for Understanding


Did Millo practice drums on her own even though she was a girl?

» thumbs up/thumbs down


~~**MAKING CONNECTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Have a copy of the book _Drum Dream Girl_ and a copy of the book _Tito Puente,_
_Mambo King_ on hand.


  - Explain to students that one way to identify connections between two people,
their stories, or their music, is to think about what they have in common. We
know that Tito Puente and Millo Castro Zaldarriaga connect in a way because
they were both Latin jazz drummers. What else did they have in common?


  - Open _Drum Dream Girl_ and turn to page 2. Read the last two lines of text.


  - From the text, we know that Millo dreamed of playing the drums.


  - Open _Tito Puente, Mambo King_, turn to the page that begins with “After the
war . . .” and read the last line of the text.

  - From the text, we know that Tito dreamed of leading his own band.


  - Explain to students that both of the musicians had dreams. So they were
both dreamers and drummers.


  - Explain to students that Millo and Tito’s stories are different in many ways as
well. Understanding how these musicians are different, or how their music is
different, helps us understand more about their stories. For example, when
Tito was young he could play the drums if he wanted to, but Millo was told
she could not.

~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.3.B; TEKS 3.6.E**~~


~~**INTRODUCING THE READING (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ensure that each student can read the text and view the illustrations in the trade
book _Duke Ellington: The Prince and His Orchestra_ by Andrea Davis Pinkney.


  - Tell students that they will listen and follow along as you read the book _Duke_
_Ellington: The Prince and His Orchestra_ by Andrea Davis Pinkney.


  - Explain to students that in this lesson they will learn about Duke Ellington,
another jazz great.


  - Tell students that Duke Ellington was born in 1899. As we have learned in
this unit, the Jazz Age and the time of the Harlem Renaissance were not
easy times for folks, especially not for the Black community. A Black author
named Ralph Ellison wrote a book called _Living with Music_, which talks a lot
about the importance of jazz during those years. Ralph Ellison loved Duke
Ellington’s music because it was lively and kept people going.


  - Explain to students that there is lively language in the book that they might
not understand right away. Affirm for students that they may raise their
hands if they have questions about words or phrases in the text.


~~**PRESENTING THE READING (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Read pages 1–6 of the book _Duke Ellington: The Prince and His Orchestra_
aloud to the class.


  - If options for audio or video presentation are available, you may play the
Read-Aloud by the PBS Learning Media clip called “Duke,” found on their
website. If not, read pages 1–6 aloud to students, then pause and ask the
following questions:


    - _What made Duke Ellington change his mind about learning to play the piano?_


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words; **TEKS**
**3.3.B** Use context within and beyond sentences to determine meaning of unfamiliar words and multiple-meaning words;

mind about something they thought they didn’t like.


 - Read pages 7–22 of the book _Duke Ellington: The Prince and His Orchestra_
aloud to the class.


 - Read with expression and pause at certain points during the reading to
clarify key ideas and core vocabulary. Give students opportunities to respond
and reflect as they follow along.


 - Pause after reading page 11, and ask students why Duke and the
Washingtonians were so lucky to be asked to play at the Cotton Club.


» Answers may vary but could include that the Cotton Club was very popular and

the music played there was also played on the radio for everyone to hear.


 - Pause after reading page 14, and ask students what the author means by
“each cat took the floor.”


» Each jazz musician in the group played in their own way.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READING (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students if they have any questions about the vocabulary in the text or
about the story in general. Pause to acknowledge and respond to students.


 - Closing questions:


1. **Literal.** _Did Duke Ellington and his orchestra play the same way every_

_night?_


» No. They often improvised.


2. **Inferential.** _Why does the author describe the individual styles of some of_

_the musicians who played for Duke Ellington and his orchestra?_


» Answers may vary but could include that the descriptions of the different

styles give the reader a sense of how the music at the Cotton Club sounded.


3. **Evaluative.** _Do you think dancing was important during the Jazz Age?_ Use

evidence from the text to support your answer.


» Answers may vary but should include students’ opinions about why people

loved to dance at the jazz clubs.

page 10, which begins “Then, on an autumn . . .” and take turns
reading paragraphs.


  - When students are done reading, have them discuss the following questions:


  - _Which other jazz musicians that you have learned about in the unit needed_
_important opportunities to become great in the world of jazz?_


» Answers may vary but could include that all of them needed opportunities and

help from others, including Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, and Millo

Castro Zaldarriaga.


  - _Can you think of a time when your favorite music lifted your spirits, or made_
_your day better? Describe it._

reading paragraphs or sentences.


 - Have student pairs identify details in the passage. Tell students to write down
what they learned about Scott Joplin from the text in the third column of the
KWL chart.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READING (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students return to their individual seats or places in the classroom.


 - Ask students what they learned about Scott Joplin from the text.


 - Have students refer to their KWL charts. Pause to acknowledge and respond
to student answers.


» Answers may vary but could include details from the text, such as: He was born in

Texarkana, Arkansas; he was 17 when he moved to St. Louis; he organized a band

in 1893; etc.


 - Ask students to imagine what Scott Joplin did, based on evidence from the
text, to make ragtime music popular and kick off the Jazz Age. Then ask
them to think about how jazz evolved from ragtime, based on the texts and
stories they have read in the unit.


 - Tell students to think about what they have learned about jazz in this unit.
Ask them how jazz evolved after Scott Joplin wrote the first popular ragtime
songs.


 - Explain that Scott Joplin played ragtime on the piano and wrote songs. Other
musicians, like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, learned how to play
ragtime, too, and then added their own style to the music. Soon, there were
many jazz musicians, and each had their own style. Ragtime became jazz,
and the jazz sound reached places like New York City and Cuba.

**Primary Focus:** Students will share their research and multimedia presentations

with their classmates. ~~**TEKS 3.1.C; TEKS 3.13.H**~~


~~**STUDENT PRESENTATIONS (90 MIN.)**~~


  - Depending on the class size and the needs of the group, there are different
options for how to run the student presentations.


  - The first option is to have students present one by one, in front of the entire
group. This option can work in smaller classes.


  - The second option is to divide the class into groups of presenters. Create
different presentation spaces around the classroom. Assign each member
of the presenting group to a space. Then have the rest of the class rotate
to listen to each presenter. Depending on the number of students, each
presenter would present two or three times to smaller groups of students.
This option allows every student to hear every presentation, and is slightly
less intimidating for presenters.


  - The third option is to divide the class into smaller groups and have each
presenter give their presentation to the other members of their group,
without rotation. Depending on the needs of the class, this can be a less
intimidating option for student presenters.


  - Before students take the stage, ensure that they have what they need to
successfully share their work. Ensure that adequate space is available for
presenting. Ensure that any necessary equipment is in place.


  - Each student presentation should have a 3–5 minute duration. Though
presentation times can vary widely, plan for each presentation to last
5 minutes, which should allow for some flexibility as presentation
time progresses.


  - Remind students to employ eye contact, appropriate speaking rate, volume
and enunciation when they make their presentations.


  - Ensure that positive feedback is happening throughout the presentation
session. Give time for audience questions after each presentation. Prompt
student questions if necessary, and ask teacher questions intermittently
during the presentations. Put the question-words on display for students to
inspire deep thinking and curiosity as they listen to the presentations.


**TEKS 3.1.C** Speak coherently about the topic under discussion, employing eye contact, speaking rate, volume, enunciation,
and the conventions of language to communicate ideas effectively; **TEKS 3.13.H** Use an appropriate mode of delivery,
whether written, oral, or multimodal, to present results.

Have students give a thumbs up if they know how to be respectful
audience members and attentive listeners. Have students give a thumbs
up if they remember how to employ eye contact, speaking rate, volume,
and enunciation when they present on a topic.


~~**MAKING CONNECTIONS (15 MIN.)**~~


 - After students have finished presenting their work, divide the class into
smaller groups for discussion. Each group will need one place to write down
their collective thoughts. Board space or a large sheet of butcher paper both
work well.


 - Have students discuss the following post-presentation questions in their small
groups. Ensure that each student has an opportunity to respond to each question.


 - Post-presentation questions:


How did you feel while presenting your research?


What was the most challenging, employing eye contact, maintaining speaking rate
or enunciating your words clearly?


What did you like the most about giving a presentation? What did you like
the least?


What was the most challenging part of putting together a presentation?


What did you like the most about listening to other student presentations?

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Assessment**

  - Prepare for **End-of-Year Silent Reading Assessment** (Activity Page A.1).


  - The written assessment of silent reading comprehension is meant to be
completed in one 50-minute block of time. This should help approximate the
extended end-of-year assessments that Grade 3 students may take. There
are two passages for students to read and 10 questions after each passage
for students to answer.


  - Students should remain seated and be encouraged to work diligently
throughout the time allotted for the assessment. You should circulate
throughout the room, giving encouragement to students; you should not,
however, provide any assistance in reading or explaining any part of the
assessment. If students ask for help, simply say in a kind and encouraging
voice, “I just want you to do your very best. If you can’t figure something out,
then come back to it later.”


  - After administering the End-of-Year Silent Reading Comprehension
Assessment, you will complete an analysis summary of individual student
performance using the EOY Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2), found
in the Activity Book. This summary should be passed on, along with the
completed assessments, to students’ teachers for the following school year.
If reading folders are kept for each student, this would be an ideal place to
file the assessment and EOY Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2).


  - Record the results of the assessment on the EOY Assessment Summary
(Activity Page A.2) and staple student assessment sheets to it.


**TEKS 3.2.A** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (v) decoding words using knowledge of prefixes; (vi) decoding

and adverbs that convey manner; (viii) coordinating conjunctions to form compound subjects, predicates, and sentences; (x)
punctuation marks including apostrophes in contractions and possessives and commas in compound sentences and items in
a series; (xi) correct spelling of words with grade-appropriate orthographic patterns and rules and high-frequency words.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


  - Prepare for **End-of-Year Grammar Assessment** (Activity Page A.3).


  - The written assessment of grammar is meant to be completed in one
30-minute block of time. This should help approximate the extended end-of­
year assessments that Grade 3 students may take.


  - Prepare for students to complete Activity Page A.6.


  - The written assessment of morphology is meant to be completed in one
30-minute block of time. This should help approximate the extended end-of­
year assessments that Grade 3 students may take.


~~**SILENT READING ASSESSMENT (50 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students take out Activity Page A.1. Remind students of the format for
the assessment.


  - Point out that some questions ask students to answer with information
or evidence that is in the text. Other questions ask students to answer by
thinking about the information provided in text and using it to arrive at their
own ideas. Explain that an inference is an assumption you can make with
the help of what you read in the text. Inferences help us move beyond simple
facts and think about bigger meanings.


  - Tell students that if they feel tired, it’s a good idea to take a short, personal
break. Explain to students that they need to respect the others in the
classroom and stay seated, while quietly looking up to the ceiling, stretching
their shoulders, and taking a deep breath or two.


  - Tell students they should go right on to the next selection once they finish
a selection.


  - Encourage students to do their best.


  - Once students finish the assessment, encourage them to review their papers,
rereading and looking over their answers carefully.


  - Again, explain the necessity of respecting that not all classmates will finish at
the same time, and, if they finish and have checked their papers, they should
remain quiet for others to finish.

Students who answered less than 6 questions correctly on “The Cat” and/
or less than 6 questions correctly on “Invasive Species” combined have
**minimal preparation** for Grade 4. Administer the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment and the Fluency Assessment found in Lesson 3 to these
students. These students likely have fairly significant skills deficits and may
not be ready for Grade 4. They will likely need to be regrouped to an earlier
point of instruction in the grade level materials.


Students who answered 7-8 questions correctly on “The Cat” and/or
7-8 questions correctly on “Invasive Species” combined have **adequate**
**preparation** for Grade 4. Administer the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment and the Fluency Assessment found in Lesson 3 to these
students. Use results from the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment to
identify gaps in the mastery of specific letter-sound spellings to provide
information to Grade 4 teachers.


Students who answered 9-10 questions correctly on “The Cat” and/or 9-10
questions correctly on “Invasive Species” combined have **outstanding**
**preparation** for Grade 4. You do not need to administer the Word Reading in
Isolation Assessment or the Fluency Assessment to these students.

**Borderline Scores**


It is most **challenging to analyze results for students** with ambiguous or
borderline scores. In particular, you may have some students who are right
on the border between being strong enough readers to benefit from Grade 4
instruction and not having adequate preparation.


This might include students who read the first story on the **Silent Reading**
**Comprehension Assessment** and answered most of the questions
correctly but struggled with the second and third story, or this might include
students whose performance was uneven on the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment or Fluency Assessment.


In analyzing results from the **Silent Reading Comprehension Assessment**,
be aware that some students may not be strong test-takers. They
may struggle to answer the questions even if they read the selection
and understood it. You may wish to have borderline students read the
selection(s) aloud to you and then discuss it with you so that you can better
determine if their struggles are a result of comprehension difficulties or
other factors.


In analyzing results from the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment,
remember that not all poor scores are the same.


Students who have difficulty reading one-syllable words may have a major
problem reading the words or spellings in question and need intensive
remediation beyond what can likely be provided in a Grade 4 classroom.


Students who have difficulty reading multi-syllable words may have trouble
with a small set of letter-sound correspondences or a less-than-adequate
knowledge of syllabication. This sort of problem can often be remediated in
supplemental, small group sessions and may not require flagging a student
for a lack of readiness for Grade 4.


Remember that one possibility is to suggest to Grade 4 teachers that
students need to be placed back at an earlier point in grade level materials,
but a second possibility is to place them in Grade 4 and suggest they receive
remedial tutoring to correct specific problems. For example, identifying
specific letter-sound correspondences causing difficulty can signal to the
Grade 4 teacher that the student may be able to practice these in extra
sessions while getting Grade 4 instruction with the rest of the class.

**End-of-Year Assessment**
#### Optional Assessments


~~**OPTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF WORD READING IN ISOLATION**~~


There are two optional assessments for the end of the year. You will find
directions for administering a word reading assessment as well as a fluency
assessment. You may decide to administer one, both, or neither, depending
on the needs of students. Each of the assessments should be administered
one-on-one with a student.


  - Prepare a copy of the following page for use during the Word Reading
in Isolation Assessment to use in administering the assessment. This
assessment is also printed in the Activity Book, Activity Page A.5

  - Have students take out all of the pages for Activity Page A.5 and collect them
before beginning. These Activity Pages will be used in conjunction with the
Word Reading in Isolation Assessment (for you to mark students’ answers on,
and for analysis of the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment; as a Scoring
Sheet; as an analysis sheet; and as a Remediation Guide).


**TEKS 3.2.A** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (i) decoding multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling
patterns such as eigh, ough, and en; (ii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables;
vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables; (iii) decoding compound
words, contractions, and abbreviations; (v) decoding words using knowledge of prefixes; (vi) decoding words using knowledge
of suffixes, including how they can change base words such as dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling final consonants;
(vii) identifying and reading high-frequency words from a research-based list.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


**Directions for Optional Word Reading in Isolation Assessment**

 - Turn to the copy of the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment that you
prepared in advance. Students will read to you from this copy of the Word
Reading in Isolation Assessment.


 - Cover all of the words before working with a student.


 - Tell the student you are assessing that today he or she will read words aloud
to you.


 - Tell the student that it is important to do his or her very best reading.


 - Uncover the first row of words by moving the paper down one space.


 - As the student reads a word, mark any incorrect letter-sound
correspondences above the word on the first page of the Word Reading in
Isolation Activity Page A.4 that students brought to you earlier. (You will use
the rest of Activity Page A.4 to analyze scores at a later time.) Also, note
whether the student incorrectly chunks letters into syllables, leading to
mispronunciation. If the student reads the word correctly, simply place a
check mark above the word.


 - If, after 10 seconds, the student is unable to read the word at all, simply
tell the student the word and move on. Mark an X above the word on the
recording sheet.


 - Continue to call students to read as time permits. Refer to the end of this
lesson for analysis direction.


 - When the student has finished reading the list, you may send the student
back to his or her desk or administer the fluency assessment.


 - At a later time, you will want to examine the scoring sheet for patterns of
errors using the guidelines provided on Activity Page A.4.


 - Record the results on the EOY Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2) and
staple the assessment recording sheets to it.

**Word Reading in Isolation Analysis**

  - The more words a student is able to read and the farther the student is able
to progress in the assessment, the stronger his or her preparation is for
Grade 4.


  - The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


  - Students who score 30 or fewer words out of 45 correctly have **minimal**
**preparation** for Grade 4.


  - Students who score 31–35 out of 45 words correctly have **adequate**
**preparation** for Grade 4.


  - Students show score 36–45 out of 45 words correctly have **outstanding**
**preparation** for Grade 4.


  - After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to determine which
phonemes students missed that caused them to score below the benchmark
for word recognition. Note that one-syllable words are not included in the
Syllabication Analysis.

~~**OPTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF FLUENCY**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.4; TEKS 3.6.F; TEKS 3.6.G**~~


  - Turn to the selection, “The Elephant and the Ape,” found at the end of this
lesson. The student will read from this copy of the selection.


  - Ask the student to take out Activity Page A.5 from his/her Activity Book. You
will use Activity Page A.5 to mark as a running record as you listen to the
student read orally. Record the results on the EOY Assessment Summary
(Activity Page A.2) and staple the running record to the EOY Assessment
Summary (Activity Page A.2).


  - Tell the student that you are going to ask him or her to read the selection
aloud. Explain that you are going to keep a record of the amount of time it
takes for the student to read the chapter. Please also explain that the student
shouldn’t rush but rather read at his or her own regular pace.


  - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page. If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the
start time since the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time. As the student
reads the chapter, make a running record on the copy with the student’s
name using the following guidelines:


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text; **TEKS 3.6.F** Make inferences
and use evidence to support understanding; **TEKS 3.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas.

 - When the student finishes reading the selection, write the exact Finish Time
in minutes and seconds on your record sheet. Alternatively, if you are using
a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. If
the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical line on the record sheet
to indicate how far the student read before you stopped him or her. Also write
down either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


 - After the student finishes reading orally, you may direct the student to
finish reading the remainder of the selection silently; you may also assess
comprehension by having the student complete the comprehension
questions orally.


~~**ORAL COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS**~~


1. **Literal.** What were the two animals in the story?


» elephant and ape


2. **Literal.** What did they disagree about?


» whether it was better to be big and strong or quick and clever


3. **Literal.** Who did they visit to decide the matter?


» Sage, the wise old owl


4. **Literal.** What task did the owl give them?


» cross the river and pick some mangoes for him


5. **Inference.** What lesson did they learn in the end?


» Sometimes it is better to be big and strong and sometimes it is better to be quick

and clever. Each thing in its place is best.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


  - Repeat this process for additional students. Scoring can be done later,
provided you have kept running records and jotted down either the Elapsed
Time or the Start Time and the Finish Time.


~~**GUIDELINES FOR CALCULATING W.C.P.M. SCORES**~~


  - If the reading was fairly accurate (10 uncorrected errors), you can get
a rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s Words Correct Per Minute
(W.C.P.M.) score simply by noting the time and looking at the chart on
Activity Page A.2.


  - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote
down on the recording sheet and follow the steps described below. The steps
are also shown in graphic form on Activity Page A.2. You will probably find it
helpful to have a calculator available.


1. First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


2. Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student read
or attempted to read, up to the point where he or she stopped. It includes
words that the student read correctly as well as words that the student
read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the whole
selection, use 464 words total.


3. If the student did not finish the selection, you will need to count the number
of words that the student actually attempted to read. Write the count for
Words Read in the matching box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Activity Page.


4. Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This includes
words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that you had
to supply.


5. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes. (A mistake that
is corrected by the student is not counted as a mistake; the student is
penalized for the time he or she lost making the correction, but not for the
initial mistake.)


6. Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


7. Next, complete the Time section of the Activity Page.


8. Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,
this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a
watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the Start
Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract seconds
from seconds and then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in Seconds.
Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to seconds, and
then add the number of seconds.


End of Year Assessment



**177**



Activity Page A.2


**178**



9. Next, complete the W.C.P.M. section of the Activity Page.


10. Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get
W.C.P.M.


11. As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


12. It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with sufficient
fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of school
assignments in subsequent grades.


13. A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other students
in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national fluency norms
for Spring of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal. Students whose
scores are below the 25th percentile are experiencing serious problems in
reading fluently.


Unit 10 All That Jazz


**The Elephant and the Ape**


“Look at me!” cried Tusk the elephant. “See how big and strong I am!”


“Look at me!” cried his friend Nim the ape. “See how quick and clever I am!”


“It is better to be big and strong than quick and clever!” said Tusk.


“Not so,” answered Nim. “It is better to be quick and clever than big
and strong.”


So the two friends began to argue.


“Let’s not argue,” said Nim. “Let’s go to Sage and ask him to settle the
matter.”


“Agreed!” said Tusk and off they ran.


Sage was a wise old owl who lived in the darkest corner of an old tower.


Sage listened to what Tusk and Nim had to say.


“I see,” he said. “There is way to settle this. You must do just as I say. Then, I
shall tell you which is better.”


“Agreed!” said Tusk.


“Agreed!” said Nim.


“Cross the river,” said Sage, “and pick me some of the mangoes that grow on
the great tree.”


Tusk and Nim set off on their mission.


Soon, they came to the river, which was very wide and deep. Nim was afraid.


“I can’t cross that river!” he cried. “Let’s go back.”


Tusk laughed. “Didn’t I tell you it is better to be big and strong than to be
quick and clever? It is an easy thing for me to cross the river.”


Tusk lifted Nim up with his trunk and put him on his broad back. Then, he
swam across the river.

Soon, they came to the mango tree. It was so tall that Tusk could not reach
the mangoes, even with his long trunk. He tried to knock the tree over but
could not do it.


“I can’t reach the mangoes,” he said. “The tree is too high. We shall have to go
back without the mangoes.”


Nim laughed. “Didn’t I tell you it is better to be quick and clever than big and
strong? It is an easy thing for me to climb this tree.”


Nim scampered up the tree and tossed down a whole basketful of ripe
mangoes. Tusk picked them up. Then, the two of them the crossed the river
as before.


When they came again to Sage’s tower, Tusk said, “Here are your mangoes.
Now tell us which is better—to be big and strong or to be quick and clever?”


Sage answered, “I should think you would know that yourself. You crossed
the river, and Nim gathered the fruit. Sometimes it is better to be big and
strong and sometimes it is better to be quick and clever. Each thing in its
place is best.”


“That is true,” answered Tusk.


“Indeed it is,” said Nim.


Then, away they went, and from that day on, they were better friends than
ever before.
