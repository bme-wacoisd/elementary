**Grade 3 | Unit 9**
Introduction


~~**COLONIAL AMERICA**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the Colonial America
unit. This unit contains 17 daily lessons, plus three Pausing Point days that may be used for
differentiated instruction. Each lesson will require a total of 120 minutes. Lesson 17 contains the unit
assessment.


As noted, three days are intended to be used as Pausing Point days. These Pausing Points are
embedded into the instruction at appropriate points, with the first one after Lesson 10, and the
second and third after Lesson 17. You may choose to continue to the next lesson and schedule the
first Pausing Point day for another day in the unit sequence. Pausing Points can be used to focus on
content understanding, writing, spelling, grammar, morphology skills, or fluency.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS**~~


**Reading**
The Reader for Unit 9, _Colonial America_, is a collection of stories and informational texts about
different colonies in early America. The story selections are historical fiction, and each is told from
a child’s point of view, just as the selections were in _Native American Stories_ . How each colony
was started and what life was like when people first arrived are described in the chapters, as well
as progress made in the few years after the land was initially settled. Students will notice the
similarities and differences among the colonies. Colonies in North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are described. Students will be given opportunities
throughout the unit to demonstrate read-aloud fluency.


**Spelling**



During Lessons 1–5, students will review words with spelling patterns for /



During Lessons 1–5, students will review words with spelling patterns for / /, / / + /l/, /sh/ + / /

+ /n/, /ue/, /oo/, and /f/. For Lessons 6–11, students will review words with spelling patterns of /oi/
spelled ‘oi’ and ‘oy’. Finally, in Lessons 12–16, students will review words with spelling patterns of /
ou/ spelled ‘ou’ and ‘ow’.



/, /



/ + /l/, /sh/ + /



On the weekly spelling assessment, students will be asked to write the spelling words, Challenge
Words, a Content Word, and two dictated sentences. You should explicitly address your expectations
with regard to the use of appropriate capitalization and punctuation when students write each
dictated sentence.


Introduction Colonial America

**2**



Students will also practice dictionary skills. Using dictionaries or copies of simulated dictionary
pages, students will identify entry words and their definitions, parts of speech, and affixed root
words. Then, students will select the correct form of the word to use in a sentence.


**Grammar**


In grammar, students will practice comparative and superlative adjectives using the suffixes – _er_
and – _est_ as well as _more_ and _most_ and be introduced to comparative and superlative adverbs using
the suffixes – _er_ and – _est_ as well as _more_ and _most_ . Students will also be introduced to subject
pronouns and their antecedents and object pronouns and their antecedents.


**Morphology**


Throughout Grade 3, students have studied word parts, such as prefixes, suffixes, and root words,
during the morphology portion of the lessons. In this unit, students will learn the common prefixes
_uni_ –, _bi_ –, _tri_ –, and _multi_ - as well as the common prefixes _over_ –, _mid_ –, and _under_ –. Students will
continue to practice their knowledge of how these affixes change the meaning and part of speech of
words. Students have done sufficient word work to be able to apply what they have learned as they
encounter unfamiliar words in text and content.


Unit 9 Colonial America


~~**WHY COLONIAL AMERICA IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit builds upon what students have learned about Native Americans who were the first to
inhabit North America and the Europeans who later explored and settled there. In addition, it
reviews what students may have already learned about the English colonies in North America.
Students will learn more about the ways in which the English colonies were established and how
each developed a unique culture. Furthermore, students will learn details about the way in which the
climate, geography, and motivations of the settlers influenced life in each of the thirteen colonies
and changed the lives of the Native peoples who originally lived there. Students will learn about our
country’s first Thanksgiving and the Thanksgiving Day speech made by Governor William Bradford.
Students will learn about the religions practiced in the English colonies, and the relatively common
desire across the colonies for religious freedom. Students will also learn about slavery in the early
colonies. Finally, students will hear a brief overview of the events leading to the signing of the
Declaration of Independence, the Revolutionary War, and the establishment of the United States as
its own nation.


The content students learn in this grade will serve as the basis for more in-depth study in the later
grades of Colonial America, the French and Indian War, and the Revolutionary War.


You may build on class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to
strands of Geography, Government, History, and Social Studies Skills from the Social Studies TEKS.
This content is not a replacement for grade-level social studies instruction. For more information on
religious source material in reading/language arts, consult the program guide. For more information
about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see
the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


**Prior Knowledge**
Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades K, 1, and 2 will have background
knowledge that is particularly relevant to the text students will read and listen to during this unit.

~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students have many opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for different purposes. During
the unit, students will be learning about and doing narrative writing, both formally and informally.
Students will learn about and apply characteristics of narratives to their own stories including
building a plot, developing characters, using dialogue, and creating an ending. Students will write a
narrative using the writing process by planning, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing.


Everyday writing opportunities come in many forms, including short and extended responses
requiring evidence from the text. Students will write reflections about what they’ve learned and
give opinions. Students will also use graphic organizers to gather and categorize information from
reading or from the Read-Aloud, or to plan for writing. Many lessons provide opportunities for
students to collaborate, share ideas, and give feedback on their writing.


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving
appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete
activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**PERFORMANCE TASKS AND ASSESSMENTS**~~


The Primary Focus objectives in each lesson are carefully structured and sequenced throughout the
unit to help build student understanding. Additionally, formative assessments are provided to help
keep track of their progress toward objectives and standards. These can be found in the Student
Activity Book and are referenced in every lesson.


There is a Unit Assessment for Colonial America that takes place in Lesson 17. Students will be
asked to read an informational passage and a literary passage and answer comprehension and
vocabulary questions about the text. In addition, students will be assessed on the grammar and
morphology skills they have studied throughout the unit.


Fluency may be assessed informally throughout the unit, but an optional Fluency Assessment is
provided in Lesson 17.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Unit 9 Colonial America


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL COMPONENTS**~~

**Core Connections**

                  - Identify an individual to play the role of a colonial American guest speaker.
You may wish to ask a parent or another teacher to play this role. If possible,
ask the individual to dress in colonial American clothing. You may wish to
create a colonial style hat or buckles for shoes from construction paper.
Please note that colonial American clothing is not required for this activity.

                 - Print a copy of the Guest Speaker script and provide it to the guest speaker.

                - Prepare Image Cards C.U9.L1.1 and C.U9.L1.2.

**Speaking and Listening**

                  - Prepare to project the following Digital Images during the Read-Aloud: U9.L1.1–
U9.L1.8

**Language**

                 - Create the following Spelling Table on chart paper or the board, or prepare to
display Digital Projection DP.U9.L1.1:

|/ә/|/ә/ + /l/|/sh/ +/ә/ +/n/|/ue/|/oo/|/f/|

|||||||
|||||||
|||||||
|||||||



                 - The decodable passage for this lesson, "Life on Roanoke Island," can be
found in the Teacher Resources section. You will use the passage to practice
the decoding skills taught in this lesson during small-group instruction,
partner work, or independent reading.

**Universal Access**

                - Pre-teach terms _prioritize_, _rate, climate,_ and _geography_ .

                 - Use a timeline for students to track events throughout the unit.

                - Project Images U9.L1.1–U9.L1.8 throughout the Read-Aloud, and discuss
prior to Read-Aloud.

                  - Create a chart that will be used to track information learned about important
people throughout this unit. This can be titled "Colonial America: Important
Persons." The blank chart should have the following two columns labeled
at the top: "Name" and "Important information." Keep this posted, and add
information to it as students learn about important figures in colonial America
throughout the unit. Students may have their own individual copies of the
chart as well. Make sure to leave plenty of room, or prepare to make additional
pages.

**Primary Focus:** Students will ask and answer questions about colonial America

from a speaker. ~~**TEKS 3.1.A; TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.6.B; TEKS 3.6.G**~~


~~**INTRODUCTION TO COLONIAL AMERICA: GUEST SPEAKER (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students what they remember learning about the terms _geography_ and
_climate_ in previous lessons or grades. Share the definition of _geography_ : “The
word _geography_ describes where a place is located and the type of _climate_,
or weather and temperatures, it experiences.” Tell students that today’s
guest speaker, Mary from colonial America, will mention how geography and
climate are relevant to the next unit.

  - Ask students: “Why do you think geography matters?” Ask students to
describe the geography and climate of where they live. Are there four
seasons? Is the land flat or hilly? Does the land have woods and rivers, or do
they live in a desert?

  - You can ask students what they do to survive the climate and geography of
where they live. They might mention the clothes they wear or their homes
that protect them from the hot sun or cold wind. You can mention that the
settlers of colonial America could not go to the store to buy a coat or find a
house that was already built. They had to make what they needed or bring it
with them. Students can brainstorm what the settlers might need and how
they could get it. Ask students to think about if they would like to go on an
adventure like the colonial settlers.

  - Tell students that over the course of the next few weeks, they will hear and
learn about the colonial period in American history.

  - Ask: “What do you know about the colonial period?“

  - Explain that an individual from the colonial period will be joining our class
today.

  - Have students turn to Activity Page 1.1. Explain that the guest speaker will
talk about the history of the time period. Students will use Activity Page 1.1 to
write down questions they have for the speaker. They will also use the activity
page to record information they learn from the guest speaker.


**TEKS 3.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write
complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words; **TEKS 3.6.B** Generate

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** In this unit, students will focus on four academic vocabulary words, two

of which are _prioritize_ and _rate_ . By academic vocabulary, we mean words that

support reading comprehension and may appear across a variety of materials,

in language arts and in other content areas. These words can be found in

textbooks, assignment directions, and assessments. Understanding academic

vocabulary may contribute to improved performance on assignments and

assessments, as these words appear often in directions to students. These

words may appear on end-of-year assessments that third graders might take.

Where applicable, we use the words throughout the unit, not just as they

might refer to reading selections but also with regard to spelling, grammar,

morphology, and comprehension. They may also appear in directions,

assessments, spelling lists, and discussion questions, among other places.


We define _prioritize_ to mean to put things in order from most important to

least important.


To _rate_ refers to judging the value or worth of something.


We encourage you to define these words for students and use both of these

words throughout the school day so that students may experience multiple

uses of them.

Map of European Exploration of
the Americas


By 1542, Spanish explorers had

occupied a large part of South

America, all of Central America, and

parts of North America and had claimed these territories as their

land. This did not go unnoticed by the kings and queens of England,

France, Portugal, and the Netherlands (Dutch). ~~_The adjective Dutch_~~

~~_is used to refer to the people from the Netherlands._~~ They, too, sent

their explorers off to the place they called the "New World" to take

land and riches for their own empires. Spain had already conquered

much of Central and South America, so other European empires

concentrated on taking over parts of North America. Before long,

there was a race to claim land, which Native Americans already

inhabited, for these European kings and queens. The settlement and

eventual colonization of these territories had begun.



Unit 9 Colonial America
**18**


Soon, European countries realized that not only could they explore

the land for riches, but they could also trade with the people who

were already living there. European traders traveled to North America

to exchange goods with Native Americans. As a result, some Native

Americans learned to speak a little French or English. In turn, many

Europeans learned to speak Native languages, such as Algonquian,

as well.

Sir Walter Raleigh Persuading
Queen Elizabeth


In the late 1500s, England was

becoming more and more **alarmed**,

or shocked and disturbed, at how

much land the Spanish colonists were claiming in what is now called

Central and South America. The Spaniards were not only gaining

land—they were becoming wealthier, too. It was time for the English

to take action.


In the 1580s, an English explorer named Sir Walter Raleigh set off to

explore parts of North America. During this expedition, he landed on

an island called Roanoke Island off the coast of what is now the state

of North Carolina. Raleigh returned home, eager to claim this land

for England. In 1585, he persuaded Queen Elizabeth I to allow him to

send a group of settlers to Roanoke Island.


Queen Elizabeth agreed. However, when the settlers got there, they

found it difficult to survive in this land that was new to them. This was

especially true in the winter because they weren’t able to plant crops.

When the settlers ran out of food, many people starved to death. As

soon as they could, the demoralized settlers returned to England.

John White at the Birth of
Virginia Dare


In April 1587, the English made a

second attempt to settle on Roanoke

Island. This time, a man named

John White led more than one hundred men, women, and children—

including his own daughter, Eleanor Dare, and her husband—to

establish a **colony** in this territory.


Once again, the settlers faced the same challenges, and their

supplies ran low. However, this time, only John White and a small

crew sailed back to England for supplies, while the others remained

in the colony. Just nine days before he returned to England,

his daughter had a baby and named her Virginia Dare. White’s

granddaughter was the first English baby born in the Americas.


**Show Image U9.L1.4**
John White and the Abandoned
Roanoke Settlement


When White and his crew arrived

back in England, he learned that the

country was at war with Spain, and

he would not be allowed to return to

Roanoke Island. It was not until 1590 that he was able to take a ship

and return to the colony. When White finally arrived back on Roanoke

Island, what do you think he found? Sadly, he found nothing. Well,

the island was still there, along with some abandoned dwellings, but

the colonists were nowhere to be found. White’s only clue to where

the colonists might have gone was the word _CROATOAN_ carved into

one tree trunk and the letters _CRO_ carved into another. _Croatoan_

was believed to be the name of an island about fifty miles south of

Roanoke Island. John White thought the carving might have been a

message that the settlers relocated to that island.



Unit 9 Colonial America
**20**


John White tried to go to Croatoan Island to find the colony, but

a huge storm damaged his ship and forced the crew to return to

England. White was never able to return to the colony again. The

mystery of what happened to these English settlers remains unsolved

today. Roanoke Island has become known as the Lost Colony.


**Teacher Note:** Students may have questions about the fate of the

settlers of Roanoke. It will be important to explain that there is still no

clear answer as to what happened to the settlers.


**Show Image U9.L1.5**
English Gentleman Trying to Adjust to
Life in the Colonies


One reason many early English

settlers struggled to survive was

because they weren’t prepared for

how different their lives would be in this land. It took several attempts

before they figured out how to survive in a place where the **climate**,

soil, landscape, plants, animals, and people were quite different from

anything they had known before. Eventually, the colonists learned how

to use the natural resources that were available to them, and they

became less **reliant** on supplies from England.


**Show Image U9.L1.6**
Regional map of Colonial America


And so, after a number of difficult

years and **false starts**, English

settlers eventually **established**

small settlements up and down

the east coast of North America. Initially, these settlements were

nothing more than tiny villages. Over time, the villages became

towns. By the 1700s, many of the towns had grown into cities that

were centers of trade and industry. In the end, thirteen successful


Lesson 1 Introduction to Living in Colonial America
**21**


English colonies were established in North America. Here you see a

map of the thirteen English colonies. You will see other maps like this

throughout the unit. The green areas on the map represent other

lands that Native Americans inhabited and areas where the Spanish

had established settlements.


**Show Image U9.L1.7**
Regional Map with Industry Icons


As the thirteen English colonies

began to take shape, they were

naturally divided into three distinct

regions: the New England, Middle

Atlantic, and Southern regions. These regions were different from

each other in many ways.


In New England, because of the colder climate, rocky terrain, and

poor soil, it was difficult for the colonists to farm many crops.

Instead, New England became known as a center for fishing, furs,

timber, and shipbuilding. In the Middle Atlantic region, a wide variety

of crops could be grown because of the milder climate and rich soil.

As a result, agriculture—including cattle and wheat farming—became

a successful way of life for many. In the warm, sprawling, Southern

region, people created large farms called **plantations**, where they

could grow large amounts of different crops, such as rice and

tobacco.

People came to North America

at different times and for many

different reasons. Some came to

religious reasons. Some hoped to escape poverty, and some were

simply curious or adventurous.


English monarchs played an important role in the establishment

of the colonies, particularly Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles

II, and George II. As we travel on our journey, we will refer to the

Regional Map of Colonial America, the Royal Portrait Gallery, and a

timeline we will create together.


So are you ready to go on a journey? Good! We are going to begin

next time in Jamestown, Virginia.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Were your predictions correct about why Roanoke Island is

called the Lost Colony today? Why or why not? Use the predictions on the

chart paper from the beginning of the lesson, and determine if predictions

are correct or incorrect.


» Answers will vary.


2. **Evaluative.** How would you compare and contrast the three colonial

regions, including their geography, climate, and main industries?


» Similarities—All of the regions were colonized by England; the settlers in each

region struggled at first to develop a new life in a new place; all of the regions were

initially reliant upon England.

Differences—In the New England region, the climate is cold for much of the year,

the terrain is rocky, and the soil is poor; fishing, lumber, and shipbuilding were the

main industries, along with fur trade. In the Middle Atlantic region, the climate is

milder, and the soil is richer; the main industry was agriculture. In the Southern

region, the climate is very hot in the summer and somewhat mild in the winter;

large plantations were developed on which many types of crops were grown.

~~**WORD WORK: ESTABLISHED (5 MIN.)**~~


                 - Write the word _established_ on the board in cursive to give students an
opportunity to practice decoding the word before discussion. Review syllable
division patterns at this time as well.

                 - In the Read-Aloud you heard, “And so, after a number of difficult years and
false starts, English settlers eventually _established_ small settlements up and
down the east coast of North America.”

                 - Say the word _established_ with me.

                      - _Established_ means set up or stabilized and often describes something
that has been around for quite some time and that will continue to be in
existence. You can establish something concrete, such as a building, or you
can establish something abstract, such as an idea or a plan.

                 - The Smithsonian Institution was established in Washington, D.C., in 1846.

                - Have you ever heard about something being established? Have you ever
established something? Be sure to use the word _established_ when you tell
about it. (Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
students’ responses to make complete sentences: “established when . . .” or
“I established a plan to . . .”)

                 - What is the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _established?_

                 - Use a _Synonyms and Antonyms_ activity for follow-up. Ask students, “What
does _established_ mean? What are some synonyms, or words that have a
similar meaning?” Prompt students to provide words and phrases such as
_founded, started, created, set up, organized, stabilized, made permanent or_
_long-term_, etc. Then ask, “What are some words or phrases you know that
are antonyms, or opposites, of _established_ ?” Prompt students to provide
words and phrases such as _destroyed_, _canceled, tore down, destabilized,_
_dismantled, abolished,_ etc. As students share synonyms and antonyms,
make sure they use the word _established_ in a complete sentence.


~~**TIMELINE OF THE AMERICAS (10 MIN.)**~~


                 - Write the following topics on the board: Maya, Aztec, and Inca; European
Explorers; Native American Groups Across North America. Guide students to
number them in chronological order:


3. Maya, Aztec, and Inca


4. Native American Groups Across North America


5. European Explorers


                - Emphasize to students that many other civilizations developed and many
other events occurred before, during, and between the events represented

**24**


by these images, but you are going to focus on those directly related to the
Timeline of the Americas for the historical context of this unit. Tell students
that some of the events on the timeline also slightly overlap with each other.
For example, Spanish, French, and other European explorers continued
to roam the Americas at the same time English settlers were establishing
colonies in North America.

  - Ask: “What event did we just learn about from the Read-Aloud?” (Roanoke
Island Colony) Remind students that this was the first attempt by English
settlers to form a colony in North America. Say, “If Sir Walter Raleigh
and John White tried to establish a colony at Roanoke Island after Native
Americans and European explorers had already explored and settled in the
Americas, what should this event be numbered on the board?”

  - Have students take out Activity Page 1.3. Explain that the events have been
filled in on the timeline.

  - Have students read the events and descriptions from the boxes in the middle.
Then number the events so that they are in chronological order. When you
are done, draw an illustration of the event.

  - Point to the Challenge Words on the board. Explain to students that
the Challenge Words, _beautiful_ and _definite_, are also part of the spelling
list and are words used very often. The Challenge Words do follow the
spelling patterns for this week, as the ‘f’ in _beautiful_ and the ‘f’ in _definite_
are pronounced /f/. Write on the board to model cursive handwriting for
students, using the Challenge Words in sentences as examples:

1. The flowers bloomed in many beautiful colors this spring.


2. Seth gave me a definite answer, saying that he would come to my birthday
party.


  - Remind students that this week, they again have a Content Word. Review
with them that the Content Word is a little harder than the other words. (If
students try to spell the Content Word on the assessment and do not get it
right, they will not be penalized. Simply correct it as you do the other words,
and applaud their effort. There should not be a penalty for not trying or
misspelling the Content Word. The important thing is they tried something
that was a stretch for them academically.)

  - Tell students that the Content Word, _Powhatan_, does follow the spelling
pattern for this week as the first ‘a’ in _Powhatan_ has the sound of _/ /_ .
_Powhatan_ is a content-related word as they are reading about the Powhatan
tribe and its role in colonial America.

- Practice the words as follows during the remaining time. Call on a student
to read any word on the table. Then have the student use the word in a
meaningful sentence. After the student says the sentence, have them ask
the class: “Does the sentence make sense?” If the class says, “Yes,” then the
student puts a check mark in front of the word and calls another student to
come to the front and take a turn. If the class says, “No,” have the student try
again or call on another student to come to the front and use the word in a
meaningful sentence. This continues until all of the words are used or time has
run out.

~~**GUEST SPEAKER SPEECH**~~


Hello students. My name is Mary. You will be reading about me in your

Reader later in the unit. Today I am here to tell you a little about the colonial

time period. Of course, you will be learning a lot more in the coming days

and weeks. I will just give you a brief overview.


You have learned a lot already this year! I talked to your teacher and heard

that you have learned about the various groups of people that explored

and settled in North, Central, and South America. I heard you learned

about Native American people who lived in the Americas and built vast

empires that existed for several hundred to thousands of years, long before

European explorers arrived, like the Aztecs, Maya, and Incas. You also

learned about European explorers like Columbus, Ponce de Leon, de Soto,

Coronado, Cabot, Hudson, Champlain, and other Europeans that traveled

to and settled in this land. Explorers were still traveling to and settling in

parts of the Americas during the time of colonial America, which is the time

period I lived in and that you will be learning about in the unit. My family

were settlers that came from Europe. You'll hear from my perspective, but

remember to consider the perspectives of other people or groups of people

as well (such as the perspective of the people that were Native to the

Americas)!


I lived during the colonial time period, between the late 1500s and the

middle 1700s when English settlers began attempting to establish, or set

up, colonies in the “New World.” That was a long time ago! During the time

of the colonial settlement, the Americas were indeed a “New World” to the

Europeans, because the Europeans had not known the land existed. Does

anyone know what a colony is? A colony is an area settled by a group of

people from another country that remains connected to the newly settled

areas and its people. Spanish, English, and other European people moved

to places where Native Americans already lived and built colonies in those

places that were connected to their home countries in Europe. Don’t worry

if it sounds confusing right now. By the end of the unit, you will be a pro at

colony talk.


Today, I brought with me a few posters. These might help you understand

the colonial period a little better. (Image Card C.U9.L1.1) English settlers

eventually established, or set up, these thirteen English colonies along

the east coast of North America—between the Spanish settlements to

the south and the French settlements to the north. Here are the thirteen

colonies. Why do you think these colonies were settled on the east coast

of North America? Right, they were easy to get to by boat. (Image Card

C.U9.L1.2) Over the course of the next few weeks, your teacher will also tell

you about some of England’s monarchs, or kings and queens, who ruled

during the time period the colonies were established. Your teacher won’t

tell you about every monarch, but you will learn about Queen Elizabeth I.


Hmmmm . . . What else do you need to know? Oh, look at my first card

again. The thirteen English colonies were divided into three regions: the

New England region in the north; the Middle Atlantic region in the middle;

and the Southern region in the south.


Your teacher will probably talk a lot about _geography_ and _climate_ throughout

this unit. Be sure to write these two words on your paper! The word

_geography_ describes where a place is located and the type of climate, or

weather and temperatures, it experiences. For instance, the climate at the

North Pole is cold and icy year-round, but in Florida, the climate is very

hot in the summer and mild in the winter. Geography also describes the

terrain, or type of physical features found in a specific region. For example,

the geography of a region includes whether it is flat, hilly, or mountainous;

whether it has trees, marshes, or desert; and whether it is near rivers, lakes,

or an ocean. Geography and climate of a region affect what types of plants

and animals live in that area.


Here is another heads-up. During the unit, you will hear about the colonies

by region rather than according to the dates the colonies were established.

This might get a little tricky. However, you will get to list to Read-Alouds and

read stories from the Reader that took places hundreds of years ago. Don’t

worry, your teacher told me you will be putting together a timeline to help

you keep track of the events in the colonies. That sounds like fun!



Unit 9 Colonial America

Well, kids. I better get back to colonial life. Who is ready to learn about the

colonial time period? All of you? Great! Maybe I’ll come back at the end of

the unit to hear about everything you learned. Until then, take good notes,

be good listeners, and learn a lot!

Unit 9 Colonial America


In the 1500s, Spain conquered large areas of Central
and South America� Spanish colonists built towns and
cities there, claiming the land as their own� Spanish
galleons sailed across the Atlantic Ocean laden with gold
and other natural resources taken from these regions�
Spain was becoming very rich� The Queen of England,
Elizabeth I, and her favorite knight, Sir Walter Raleigh,
wanted England to become as rich and powerful as
Spain� They wanted English people to go to this place
they called the “New World” too�


In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh **persuaded** Queen
Elizabeth to let him try to create an English **colony** in
the Americas� It was decided that the English would stay
away from the powerful Spanish conquistadors� Instead
of sailing to Central or South America, they would sail
north, to North America� With that decided, a group of
explorers set off to find a suitable place to settle�

**Pages 10–11**


 - Explain to students that on the next few pages the chapter is going to go back

in time to the 1500s. This information will be a review and a support to what

was read earlier in the lesson. Remind students that to _conquer_ means to take

control of a place and claim it as your own. _Conquistadors_ is a term used to

describe conquerors (or people that conquered), particularly from Spain.


 - Ask students to read **pages 10** and **11** to themselves to find out why the Queen

of England and Sir Walter Raleigh wanted the English people to go to what they

called the "New World."


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have students answer.


» Spain was becoming very rich by conquering large areas of Central and South

America and bringing gold and other natural resources home. The Queen of England

and Sir Walter Raleigh wanted England to become as rich and powerful as Spain.


 - Ask, “Why did Sir Walter Raleigh decide to avoid Central or South America and

sail north to North America?”

» to create an English colony in the Americas; to stay away from the Spanish conquistadors

The explorers who went on this expedition in 1584
reported back to Sir Walter Raleigh and told him about
Roanoke Island� Speaking highly of the land they
encountered, they believed this island was a perfect
place for the first English **colony**   - Sir Walter Raleigh's
explorers managed to build a fort on the island to protect
themselves from possible attacks from outsiders, but they
failed to create a **colony**   - They abandoned their mission,
leaving only fifteen men behind to guard the fort�
However, Sir Walter Raleigh was determined to succeed�
In 1587, more ships set out for this territory�


Robert and George were members of this second
group of would-be English colonists� They had been very
excited to set off on this great adventure� This time, the
colonists planned to land north of Roanoke Island, in
the Chesapeake Bay area� There, they hoped to establish
the first successful English **colony**

Unit 9 Colonial America


Unfortunately, during the trip, there was a
disagreement between their leader John White and
members of the ship’s crew� As a result, members of the
ship’s crew refused to take the English travelers to the
Chesapeake Bay area� So, Robert, George, and the other
passengers were forced to land on Roanoke Island in late
July� Robert and George had not minded this change
of plan� They had simply been happy to be on solid
ground once more�


However, this was not the end of the travelers’
troubles� After landing, John White led a group of
men to Fort Raleigh, the fort that had been built by
the previous group� Robert and George had not been
allowed to go with the men� At the fort, John White
and the other men expected to find the fifteen English
soldiers who had been left behind to guard it� When
they arrived at the fort, the soldiers were nowhere to be
found� The fort was **overgrown** with weeds�

When John White and the men returned to the
beach with this news, Robert and George had felt scared�
The boys wondered what had happened to the soldiers�
The only good news was that it was possible to repair the
homes in Fort Raleigh�


The settlers got to work� Robert, George, and
more than one hundred men, women, and children
worked from sunrise to sunset to reconstruct these
homes� However, the boys and the other settlers found
it **alarming** that, when winter came, they did not have
enough food to survive until spring� They had arrived at
a time when it was too late to plant crops�

**Pages 16–17**


**• Note:** Students may have questions about what happened to the English

soldiers that were left behind on Roanoke Island. It is important to explain that,

even today, there is no clear answer as to what happened to them.

1. **Evaluative.** Do you think the settlers survived? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary but could include that Sir Walter Raleigh was very determined

to succeed so he would likely do everything possible to help the settlers survive.

Students may also remember that this was a second attempt to set up a colony

as the first was not successful. Students may wonder what happened to the rest

of the first settlers. Finally, students may wonder if John White would return in

time with food since the settlers had arrived too late to plant crops.

**Comparative and Superlative Adjectives**


**Comparative adjectives** compare two nouns to show that one is greater

or more. The suffix – _er_ is added to adjectives.


**Superlative adjectives** compare more than two nouns to show that one is

greatest or most. The suffix – _est_ is added to adjectives.


Instead of the suffixes – _er_ and – _est_, use the words _more_ and _most_ when

forming comparative and superlative adjectives that end with the suffixes

_–ful, –less, –ing, –ed, –ous_ or that have three or more syllables.


**Note:** Note for students that their ability to use these adjectives correctly

is more important than knowing the names of the adjectives.




 - Remind students that the pattern of adding _–er_ and _–est_ to adjectives is

as follows.

- Ask, “Why did you add the word _more to unusual?_ ” (Two paintings are being

compared, which calls for the comparative form.)


- Ask, “Why didn’t you add the suffix – _er_ instead?” (The adjective _unusual_ has

four syllables so it needs the word _more_ instead of the suffix – _er_ .)


- Uncover sentence 4, and ask a student to fill in the form of the adjective

_beautiful_ that fits in the sentence. ( _most beautiful_ )


That is the sunset I’ve ever seen! ( _beautiful_ )


- Ask, “Why did you add the word _most_ to _beautiful_ ?” (More than two sunsets

are being compared, which calls for the superlative form.)


- Ask, “Why didn’t you add the suffix – _est_ instead?” (The adjective _beautiful_ ends

with the suffix – _ful_ so it needs the word most instead of the suffix – _est_ .)


- Uncover sentence 5, and ask a student to fill in the form of the adjective _good_

that fits in the sentence. ( _best_ )


Mom makes the pizza in the whole world! ( _good_ )


- Ask, “Why didn’t you add the suffix – _est_ or the word _most_ ?” (The adjective

_good_ is irregular so a new word is formed.)


- Uncover sentence 6, and ask a student to fill in the form of the adjective _much_

that fits in the sentence. ( _more_ )


I can eat popcorn than you can. ( _much_ )


- Ask, “Why didn’t you add the suffix _–est_ or the word _most_ ?” (The adjective

_much_ is irregular so a new word is formed.)

they see in parenthesis as either a comparative or a superlative adjective in

She and her husband Daniel Tucker were now in
charge of Tom and his sister, Jane� They were good
children, but they had arrived with very few skills�
Fortunately, Tom was proving to be a good hunter�


Like the Tuckers, Tom and Jane were from London,
England� Both children had arrived in Jamestown,
Virginia, five months earlier, in April, 1618� When they
first arrived, it was clear that they didn’t want to be
there� For days, they refused to speak� They cried all the
time� Their clothes were **tattered** and grimy, and they
were very thin�


Tom, Jane, and one hundred other children had
sailed to Jamestown on an English trading ship� Sailing
across the ocean is never a good experience� But that was
not the only reason why they looked so raggedy when
they first arrived� Tom and Jane had been street children�
In England, their parents had died, and they had been
found trying to survive on the streets of London� In fact,
all of the children who were sent to Jamestown had been
living that way�

Times were hard in England� There were hundreds
of children begging on the streets of London� The king
of England, James I, thought that so many homeless
children would lead to trouble� He had the children
rounded up and shipped 3,000 miles across the Atlantic
Ocean to Jamestown�


Families in the **colony** had agreed to take the
children in and put them to work� After all, there was
certainly a lot to be done� People were needed in the
fields� The colonists grew corn, squash, pumpkins, and
tobacco� They had to hunt and fish as well� In addition,
children were needed to cook, sew, make candles, and
make soap� Boys and girls were needed to look after
the cattle, goats, horses, and pigs that the colonists had
brought with them� Children also cared for fruit trees
and berry bushes�

Lesson 3 The Founding of Jamestown
**59**


The English colonists had first arrived in Jamestown,
Virginia, in 1607� Some of the first English colonists had
died of hunger and sickness� Others had not survived
the freezing cold temperatures� Some early colonists
even left their settlement and joined the Powhatan,
who could offer them a better life with more food
than in Jamestown� However, none of these things had
stopped more colonists from coming to Jamestown to
start a new life�


One of the first colonists, a man named John Smith,
had helped to save the **colony** from collapse� Another
colonist named John Rolfe had introduced a new kind of
tobacco into this area� This crop was important because
the colonists earned money selling it� Tobacco had
become popular in Europe� With John Rolfe’s help, the
colonists learned how to grow lots of tobacco� By 1618,
they were able to send more than two thousand pounds
of tobacco to England each year� Tobacco made lots of
money for the **colony**

**Pages 26–31**

- Have students read **pages 26–31** to themselves to find the answer to the question:

“What crop did John Rolfe introduce to the colony, and why was it important?”

- When students have finished reading, restate the question, and have students answer.


» John Rolfe introduced a new type of tobacco. Tobacco was popular in Europe. With

John Rolfe’s help, colonists were able to ship more than 2,000 pounds of tobacco

each year, which made lots of money for the colony.


Unit 9 Colonial America


“Where have you been, boy?” said a tall man with
brown hair� “I’ve harvested several pounds of tobacco
leaves already�”


Tom did not reply� Instead, he grabbed a basket and
got to work� He had already figured out that the wellbeing of the colonists depended upon this plant� Much
care and attention was paid to it� When he first arrived,
Tom saw that the colonists had already planted tobacco
seeds in tiny beds� They had covered the seeds with
branches to protect them from the snow� When the seeds
became seedlings, they were then **transplanted** into the
fields� Moving the seedlings happened in April and was
the hardest job of all� Finally, the colonists had to harvest
the crop before the first frost�

1. **Evaluative.** Do you think Tom and his sister Jane will have a better life in

Jamestown? If you do, explain why. If you do not, explain why not.


» Answers may vary but could include: In Jamestown, they will live with parents in

a house, where they will be cared for, fed, and kept warm. In England, they were

street children and did not have a home or food provided for them. They had to

beg for food. Students may notice that Tom and Jane cried all the time and both

children refused to speak when they first arrived. Students may also feel that

Ann Tucker appeared to be mean when she fussed at Tom for being late to get to

the tobacco fields. Children were required to work all day, and it was hard work.

The images of the children working on **page 25** show the unsmiling faces of Tom

and Jane. However, at the end of the chapter, Tom was looking forward to the

celebration when the crops were harvested.

European Explorers: Columbus,
Ponce de León, de Soto, Coronado,
Cabot, Hudson, and Champlain


Once word got out about Christopher

Columbus’s successful voyages across

the Atlantic, many other adventurers and explorers sailed off in search

of this wondrous place. They were all motivated by the excitement of

exploration, the possibility of becoming rich, and the thrill of discovery

including the potential of new trade routes to the East Indies. Before long,

the explorers were replaced in part by conquerors, who intended to take

charge of this “New World,” and its wealth, and more so by settlers, who

intended to try to establish a life in the New World.


For a while, Spain focused most of its energies on getting as much gold

and silver from Central and South America as it could, though some

Spanish scouting parties even ventured into southern parts of North

America and beyond. This left the seemingly less-appealing North

America wide open to the **ambition** of the French, English, Dutch, and

other empires.


The people of these countries had heard stories of the vast amounts of

gold and silver the Spanish conquistadors had found in Central and South

America. These new explorers and adventurers intended to become rich,

too. They not only hoped to claim land, but to bring back ships laden with

valuable gold and silver for their proud kings and queens.


In the early 1600s, French explorers, such as Samuel de Champlain,

ventured onto land in North America and set up fur-trading stations

along the St. Lawrence River in what is present-day Canada. Dutch

explorers sailed up what is now known as the Hudson River through

present-day New York State. The English set sail for Virginia. At this time,

all lands and treasures that were new to the Europeans were usually

claimed for the nation that the ship and crew sailed under. In other

words, the lands were claimed for the kings and queens of Europe.


Lesson 3 The Founding of Jamestown
**65**


**66**



However, these three nations soon discovered that, although there was

plenty of land, there was very little gold and silver to be found. This certainly

was the case for those who set off to explore and possibly settle in Virginia.


**Show Image U9.L3.2**

Would-be Settlers on Ship


In 1606, on a cold wintry day in

December, three English ships set sail

for Virginia. More than one hundred

men and a handful of boys were on

board the _Discovery_, the _Susan_ _Constant_, and the _Godspeed_, under the

command of Captain Christopher Newport. Some of the men were well
known, daring adventurers. Others were **seasoned**, or very experienced,

sailors. There were farmers and skilled craftsmen on the journey, too.


- Picture Pause: (Teacher Model: The text says, this reminds me of . . . format)

Explain to students that when we make connections, we will follow the “I made

a connection. The text says, this reminds me of  ” format. Model

an example for the students: I made a text-to-self connection. In the text, it

says “on a cold wintery day in December.” I used to live in Michigan, where they

have very cold and wintery days in December. I can imagine how cold it was on

the ship.


Imagine agreeing to set sail across a vast ocean in a small, not-so
sturdy ship. More than likely, you are not a trained sailor, and, like

hundreds of others on board, you’re hoping to find a land that very

few Europeans have been to before. Perhaps, during the voyage,

you suffer from seasickness or become fearful of encountering sea

monsters.


Investors in a company that came to be known as the Virginia

Company of London paid for the voyage. The main purpose of

this expedition was to make money from natural resources in the

Americas, including precious metals. Everyone involved, especially


Unit 9 Colonial America


the investors, expected to get a generous share of the profits. They

hoped to find and bring these valuable resources back to Europe.


In addition, King James I of England had given the men a charter, or

official document, that allowed them to claim a very large area of land

in what would be the Americas. This area of land stretched from what

is now the state of South Carolina all the way up the east coast to

Canada.


**Show Image U9.L3.3**

Settlers on Ship Approaching Land


Because the party of English settlers

had set off in December, strong

winter storms made their journey

even more difficult. They also ran

**perilously** low on food and water. However, the passengers and

crew survived, and five months later, in May 1607, they finally caught

a glimpse of land. They sailed closer to the shoreline into what is

now called the Chesapeake Bay area. As they approached this land,

they decided to sail up a wide river they had spotted. Because King

James was eager to claim everything the English saw, this river was

promptly named the James River in honor of his royal highness.


This would be the final part of their journey. As the men sailed up the

newly named James River, they were on the lookout for a **safe haven**,

a protected place where they could **moor**, or dock, their ships. About

sixty miles upriver, they found an area of land with deep water near

the shoreline. The land appeared to be unoccupied. It was time to

drop anchor.


This land, however, was not unoccupied. Native Americans had already

lived there for thousands of years. By the time the settlers arrived

in what is now Virginia, the Powhatan had already established their

own government with over 30 Algonquian-speaking Native American

tribes and over 25,000 people. The Powhatan had a thriving economy

and a political system that did not rely on identifying who owned what

land. They had a collaborative way of harvesting and distributing the

food supply amongst all the tribes. So the Powhatan system focused

less on who controlled what and more on appreciating what the land

could provide for everyone. Under their leader, Wahunsenacawh,

commonly known as Chief Powhatan, each tribe had their own chief

that could be male or female. Women were often leaders and were

generally treated as equals.


Now let’s return back to the Englishmen that were just arriving by

ship, looking to settle in these lands.

Settlers Stepping onto Land with Pomp
and Circumstance


The next day, the would-be settlers

ventured ashore. With much pomp

and circumstance, they stepped onto

Virginia soil. Trumpets were sounded, prayers were said, and it was

proclaimed that this land was now the property of—can you guess?

Let me give you a clue: he wore a crown, and his name was James. Yes,

that’s right—his majesty, King James I. As you can see, there were many

advantages to being a king in those days.

Jamestown Construction


As it was late spring, it was warm, and

there was an abundance of plants and

wildlife. The settlers set to work. They

began to construct a small settlement

containing basic homes, a storehouse, and a chapel. To protect their

settlement, they built high walls made of logs around it and placed a

cannon nearby. The settlers named this settlement Jamestown, after

the King of England. Jamestown became England’s first permanent

settlement in America.


It wasn’t long before a group of Powhatan, led by a chief of the same

name, came to watch what these people were up to. As the days

went by, the Powhatan became angry at the sight of what appeared

to be the construction of a permanent settlement. Eventually, the

Powhatan took action and tried to eject the settlers from their land.


The settlers had not chosen the site of their settlement wisely.

Besides the fact that this land was already occupied by thousands of

Powhatan people, the land they chose for their settlement provided

other challenges. So close to the water, the land turned out to be

marshy and full of mosquitoes. When they dug down into the earth

to find drinking water, they found the water was virtually undrinkable

because it was brackish, or salty. To add to the problems, some of

the settlers wanted to focus on searching for gold and silver instead

of planting seeds for much-needed crops. Away from the safety and

familiarity of England, the group began to disagree. It was clear that

the settlers of Jamestown needed a leader.

Settlers Seeing Captain Newport and
Men Off


At some point during the summer, it

was decided that Captain Newport

and a small group of men would take

the _Godspeed_ and the _Susan Constant_ back to England. Once there,

they would spread the news about this new land that King James and

England had acquired, and they would load up the ships with much
needed supplies to return to Jamestown.


With this decision made, someone needed to take charge of those

staying behind. For a while, several of the men argued about who

knew best what to do and how to survive. Then as the weather

became warmer—much warmer than they were used to in chilly

England—various members of the party became sick with fever and

disease that could not be cured. People began to die.

~~**GRAMMAR: ADVERBS THAT COMPARE ACTIONS (15 MIN.)**~~


- Display the Comparative and Superlative Adverbs Poster, or display Digital

Projection DP.U9.L3.2.

) **Comparative and Superlative Adverbs**
**(Digital Projection DP.U9.L3.2)**


**Comparative and Superlative Adverbs**


**Comparative adverbs** compare two actions to show that one is greater or

more. The suffix – _er_ is added to adverbs.


**Superlative adverbs** compare more than two actions to show that one is

greatest or most. The suffix – _est_ is added to adverbs.


Instead of the suffixes _–er_ and _–est,_ use the words _more_ and _most_ when

forming comparative and superlative adverbs that end with the suffixes _–_

_ful, –less, –ing, –ed,_    - _ous_ or that have three or more syllables.


- Review that adverbs describe verbs. Adverbs that tell _how_ usually end with – _ly._

There are adverbs that tell _when_ and _where_ also.


- Ask students to provide examples of adverbs that end with – _ly_ that tell how

and adverbs that tell _when_ and _where_ . Examples could be _carefully, nicely,_

_yesterday, soon, there_, and _here_ .


- Tell students that this week, they will learn about adverbs that compare

actions. Adverbs compare actions, and they may tell _how, when_, or _where_ .


- When comparing two actions, use adverbs that end with – _er_ . These are

adjectives that have – _er_ added to them to make adverbs. Examples could be

_clearer, nicer, higher._


- Uncover sentences 1 and 2 that you prepared in advance.


1. My brother left for school. (late)


2. My mom left for work than my dad. (later)


- Ask students what the adverb is in sentence 1. Students should respond _late._

Draw a triangle around _late,_ and arrow it to the verb it describes _(left)_ . Tell

students that _late_ describes one action, _how_ my brother left for school.


- Then, ask students what the adverb is in sentence 2. Students should respond

_later_ . Draw a triangle around _later,_ and arrow it to the verb it describes. _(left)_

Tell students that in this second sentence, _–er_ has been added to the word _late_

to make _later_ . The adverb _later_ is comparing two actions, those of my mom

and my dad.


Unit 9 Colonial America


- Uncover sentence 3 that you prepared in advance.


3. My sister left the of us all to get to school. (late)


- Ask students what the adverb is in sentence 3. Students should respond

latest. Draw a triangle around _latest,_ and arrow it to the verb it describes. ( _left_ )


- Tell students that in this sentence _, –est_ had been added to the word _late_ to

make latest. Tell students that when adverbs end with _–est,_ that means more

than two actions are being compared. The adverb _latest_ is comparing more

than two actions, in this case the actions of all of us. In many cases, when an

adverb ends with _–est_, the sentence will contain the words _of all_, which is an

indication that more than two actions are being compared.






- Uncover sentence 4 that you prepared in advance.


4. The package with books arrived than the package with the DVDs.

(soon)


- Tell students that in sentence 4 the comparison is between when the two

packages arrived. One package arrived _sooner_ than another one arrived. Two

things are being compared here, so using the word _sooner_ is appropriate to

describe how the packages arrived. Draw a triangle around the adverb _sooner_

and arrow it to the verb it describes. ( _arrived_ )






 - Uncover sentence 5 that you prepared in advance.


5. The package of shoes arrived the of all. (soon)


 - Ask students what they notice that is different about the adverb in sentence 5.

(They should respond that instead of the word soon ending with – _er_ it ends

with – _est_ .)


Lesson 3 The Founding of Jamestown
**77**


- Tell students that in sentence 5, the comparison is for when many packages

arrived so using an adverb that ends with – _est_ is appropriate. Draw a triangle

around the adverb _soonest,_ and arrow it to the verb it describes. _(arrived)_






- Uncover sentence 6 that you prepared in advance.


6. She reached on the bookshelf to grab books about ancient Greece

than to grab books about ancient Rome. (high)


- Tell students that they will use the word _high_ to fill in the blank with either – _er_

or _–est_ added to it.


- Read sentence 6, including the blank, to students. Ask students what the verb

is in the sentence. ( _reached_ )


- Tell students that they need to change the word _high_ to make it describe _how_

she reached the books about ancient Greece.


- Ask students how many actions/things are being compared. ( _two_ )


- Then, ask students which kind of adverb is used when comparing two actions.

( _adverbs that end with –er_ )


- Read sentence 6, inserting the word _higher,_ and ask students whether that

makes sense. Model how you check to be sure the word _highest_ does not fit

by reading the sentence with that word inserted.


- Then, write the word _higher_ in the blank. Draw a triangle around it, and arrow

it to the verb it describes. (reached)





**78**




- Ask students where she reached to get the books about ancient Greece

compared to those about ancient Rome. They should respond _higher_ .


- Follow these procedures for sentences 7, 8, and 9. Use the following key for

filling in the blank:


   - Sentence 7: _fast (fastest)_


   - Sentence 8: _bright (brightest)_


   - Sentence 9: _quick (quickest)_


Unit 9 Colonial America


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 3.4. Complete this as a teacher-guided

activity. Provide feedback to students on pronunciation. Have students reread

if necessary to increase fluency. Consider using the following procedure:


    - Select a student to read aloud the first sentence.


    - Ask students to identify the verb in the sentence.


    - Ask students to read the adjective that will be changed to an adverb for this

sentence. (The adjective is listed in parentheses at the end of each sentence.)

    - Ask students how many actions/things are being compared in the sentence.


    - Ask students how the adjective should be changed to an adverb to fit

in the sentence. (either adding – _er_ or _–est_ )


    - Ask students to write the adverb in the blank and answer the question

under the sentence.


 - Continue until students have completed the activity page.


~~**SPELLING: BLANK BUSTERS (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they will practice writing their spelling words for this week.


 - Tell students to turn to Activity Page 3.5. Note for students that one sentence

has two blanks.


 - Point out to students that the spelling words are listed in the box on the

activity page and on the board. Students may also have to add an appropriate

suffix to have the sentence make sense: – _s_, – _ed_, _–ing_, _– er, –ly_, and – _est_ .


 - Ask students to read the statement in number 1 silently and fill in the blank.

When students have completed number 1, call on one student to read number 1

aloud with the spelling word in the blank.


 - Ask students whether anyone had a different answer. Discuss the correct

answer to be sure students understand why it is correct.


 - Discuss the proper spelling of the word in the blank, referencing the table

of this week’s spelling words. Have students compare their spelling with the

spelling in the table.


 - Have students move to number 2 and fill in the blank on their own.


 - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all

assignments in this unit. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

Lesson 4 “ Jamestown and the Powhatan”
**87**


**Student Reader page 32**

John Smith Talking to the Colonists


Captain John Smith was hardworking

and organized. Many historians

believe that without him, Jamestown

would not have survived. When John





Smith finally took charge of the settlement, he did not “beat around

the bush.” Smith introduced a very direct rule: only those who worked

would eat.


As you can imagine, Smith was not very popular with everyone,

especially the wealthy, young adventurers who had never worked

a day in their lives.


John Smith knew it would be a huge challenge for the settlers to

survive the cold winter months. As the weeks went by, Smith urged

everyone to work on the construction of Jamestown, to gather fruits

and berries, to fish and hunt, and to use **sparingly,** or very carefully,

the little food they had stored.


- Picture Pause (Teacher Modeling): Say, “What question(s) do I have about the

text? How did John Smith’s plan for using food sparingly, or carefully, work



during the winter?”



~~**TEKS 3.6.B**~~



**Student Reader pages 33–35**

John Smith Among the Powhatan


There are several different accounts

of what happened during this time.

One well-known version of the story,

which you may have heard, tells how









**88**



when the cold winter months came, many of Smith’s fellow settlers

were sick and starving to death. John Smith set off to hunt and to

persuade the Powhatan to give them food.


**TEKS 3.6.B** Generate questions about text before, during, and after reading to deepen understanding and gain information.


Unit 9 Colonial America


According to this account, which some might call a legend, Smith was

captured by Powhatan warriors and taken to their chief, Wahunsenacawh

(also known as Chief Powhatan), because they wanted to harm the man

who was leading the foreigners. Then, as the story goes, just moments

away from Smith’s death, Chief Powhatan’s young daughter Matoaka

( _mah_ -toe- _ah_ -kah) begged her father to spare Smith. Matoaka’s nickname

was Pocahontas (which some say means playful), which is the name

she has been famously called. Chief Powhatan agreed to his daughter’s

request, and Smith was released.


However, many historians today believe that this is not what actually

happened. They think that Chief Powhatan ordered the capture of

John Smith in order to adopt him into the Powhatan community and

make him a chief to strengthen their alliance. These historians believe

that Chief Powhatan hoped that John Smith would help him defend the

Powhatan against enemy tribes and Spanish settlers. The Powhatan

ritual of honoring someone with chiefdom, involved figuratively (not

really) “destroying” their old identity, in order for them to be “reborn”

and take on their new identity as chief. So John Smith and the settlers

could have misunderstood the Powhatan’s intentions and incorrectly

believed they wanted to harm John Smith.


When Smith returned to the Jamestown settlement, the colonists

had abandoned their work schedule. They were **squabbling,** or

arguing, among themselves again. Snow was on the ground, and

their food supply was very low. Some were even spending their time

foolishly, searching for gold. Smith was not pleased. He immediately

set to work hunting and fishing, and doing what he could to **persuade**

his cold, hungry, disheartened companions that all was not lost.



**Student Reader pages 35–36**

Pocahontas Bringing Food to Colonists


Then, one day, a small band of

Powhatan, led by Pocahontas, appeared

out of the forest. The Powhatan brought

with them much-needed food to trade

with the colonists. Under the guidance of Chief Powhatan, they also

taught the English new hunting and farming techniques, in exchange for

goods and an alliance.


The food the Powhatan provided was enough to keep the English alive

until help from Britain arrived. That help came in January 1608, when

Captain Newport’s ship, the _Susan Constant_, arrived laden with food

and more than one hundred new settlers. The English colonists were

concerned that the Powhatan might object to even more strangers

trying to settle in their territory. So they invited Chief Powhatan to

Jamestown offering him gifts and proposing to crown him (and have

him swear allegiance to King James I). Chief Powhatan refused to come.

John Smith said that Powhatan’s response was: “I also am a king, and

this is my land...” Chief Powhatan did not want to bow to another ruler

and wanted to continue to govern his own people.

Activity Page 4.1.



**Student Reader pages 37–38**

Jamestown on Fire


For a while, the situation for Smith

and his men improved. With more

food to eat, they had energy to work.

With more men, they had more hands









to help construct the much-needed homes. Then, tragedy struck.

Somehow—and it is not certain how—a fire broke out. The fierce

flames quickly **devoured** many of the buildings, as well as some of

the food supply and clothes. You can imagine how devastating, or

upsetting, this was for the settlers.


The English had no choice but to start again. Fortunately, by this time,

the weather was getting warmer. The Powhatan had taught them

how to grow corn, which they called maize, now that the weather was

better. Native Americans helped them once again by bringing more


Unit 9 Colonial America


food to trade with the English. Under John Smith’s supervision, the

men set to work rebuilding their homes, planting corn, and learning

how to live in this land that was new to them.


When spring came, Captain Newport set sail again for England. Some

historians have written that the colonists who had been wasting their

time searching for gold **persuaded** Captain Newport to load his ship

with a large amount of red-colored dirt and bring it with him. The

gold-hungry colonists were certain that tiny pieces of gold would be

found once the dirt was properly examined in England. However, no

gold was found. It seems that Captain Newport **transported** nothing

more than a shipload of dirt across the Atlantic Ocean!







**Student Reader pages 38–41**

New Settler Arrivals with the First Women


Captain Newport returned to

Jamestown again in the fall. The

English colonists were happy to see

him again. This time, Newport brought





more supplies, as well as seventy men, and two women. One woman,

Margaret Foxe Forrest, was the wife of one of the men on board, and

the other was her maid, Ann Burras. They were the first two female

settlers to live in Jamestown! Some of the other new settlers were

from Poland and Germany, and they brought the skill of glassmaking

to the **colony** .


By this time, John Smith had been elected president of the colony,

and he had consistently enforced his rule: all must work if they

wanted to eat. In fact, these are Captain John Smith’s exact words:

“He that gathereth not every day as much as I do, the next day shall

be set beyond the river and be banished from the fort as a drone till

he **amend** his conditions or starve.”


Under John Smith’s leadership, the colony began to prosper. ~~_Prosper_~~

and the settlers. The two communities began to trade with each

other. Powhatan people provided food and taught important skills to

settlers in exchange for beads and copper.


However, two years after Jamestown was established, John Smith

was injured in a gunpowder explosion. Without medical assistance,

his wounds would not heal. Smith was forced to return to England.


The man chosen to lead the **colony** in Smith’s absence was George

Percy. Unfortunately, Percy was not as good a leader as Smith had

been. After Smith left, the Powhatan’s mistrust grew of the increasing

crowd of settlers encroaching upon their land and food supply.


Without John Smith there to actively promote friendship and trade

between the Powhatan and the colonists, relations began to suffer.

In addition, Chief Powhatan had passed away, and his successor, his

brother, did not agree with the alliance he had made with the settlers.

The Powhatan no longer had someone they felt they could trust

within the **colony** . Without John Smith there to enforce his rules,

the settlers did not manage their food supplies as carefully as they

should have. The settlers and the Powhatan battled, and then, once

again, part of the settlement caught fire.


- Picture Pause: Independently, write down one question about the text on

Activity Page 4.1.



**Student Reader pages 41–42**

Great Distress in Jamestown


After the battle and the fire, the

Powhatan blocked trade with the

settlers. They could not find enough

food to support the community.

Activity Page 4.1.



The settlers waited **anxiously** for a ship that was due to arrive with

supplies. But no ship appeared on the horizon. The winter of 1609 to

1610 became known as the **“starving time”** because the colonists

ran out of food and many of them died.


Unit 9 Colonial America



**92**


Finally, one spring day, two ships were spotted. They were the

_Patience_ and the _Deliverance_ . The settlers who had survived ran to

the banks of the James River in eager anticipation. Both ships had

been badly damaged at sea and had just barely made it to Virginia.

The ships were low on supplies. The settlers begged to be taken back

to England, and the two captains agreed.


Perhaps the most incredible part of this story is what happened next.

Just as the surviving settlers had turned their backs on Jamestown

and set sail for England, they spotted an advance party of Englishmen

sailing toward them. The retreating settlers were immediately informed

that Lord De la Warr was close behind. Lord De la Warr was appointed

by King James to serve as governor, or leader, of Jamestown. Lord

De la Warr, it seems, had saved the day—well, the entire settlement,

actually. He had led three ships across the Atlantic filled to the brim

with Englishmen and supplies **destined** for Jamestown.



Challenge


Have students record the
answer on Activity Page 4.1
and specific details from
the text that support the
answer.







**Student Reader pages 42–43**

Lord De la Warr Takes Charge


The Powhatan were probably angered

and frustrated to see the settlers

return. Even worse, there were more of

them! Lord De la Warr turned out to be





a better leader for the settlers than their previous one. He restored a

sense of order in Jamestown. Under his leadership, the buildings were

repaired, and the food and supplies were efficiently managed. However,

Lord De la Warr did not reach out to the Powhatan as John Smith had.

Things in England were changing, and the instructions to Jamestown

from the Virginia Company of London were to stop trading with and

relying upon the nearby Native Americans.


Over the next several years, more and more skilled settlers made

their way to Virginia. Eventually, in 1619, the first shipload of women

arrived. Colonists began to raise families in this English **colony** .

In time, a settler named John Rolfe began to establish a relationship

House of Burgesses Assembly


There were other important

developments that took place in 1619.

Now that things were going better

in the English colonies, the English









government felt comfortable allowing the colonists to make certain

rules of their own. That was, as long as the colonists remembered

who was really in charge. On July 30, 1619, the first lawmaking

assembly gathered in the Virginia House of Burgesses. Members of

the House of Burgesses were chosen to represent areas of the **colony**

of Virginia. In those days, only men could be chosen, but the House

of Burgesses would eventually pave the way for self-government and,

ultimately, independence.

John Rolfe and Pocahontas
Meet King James I


Conflict continued between the

Powhatan and the colonists because

each group believed they were the









**94**



most dominant power in the region. During another period of conflict,


Unit 9 Colonial America


each group tried to take things of high value from the other. The

Powhatan kidnapped some of the settlers and took several firearms, or

guns, and the settlers kidnapped Pocahontas. Pocahontas’s father was

willing to return the kidnapped settlers in exchange for his daughter,

but he refused to return such valuable supplies. In response, the

settlers refused to let Pocahontas go. **Consequently**, or as a result,

Pocahontas was held captive in the English settlement for many years.


During this time, Pocahontas and John Rolfe were married and

later had a child named Thomas. Pocahontas was converted to

Christianity and took the name Rebecca, an English name. It was

not uncommon for Native Americans to be expected to change their

name and customs when engaging with European colonists. She and

John Rolfe traveled together to England, where they were guests

at the court of King James. ~~How might Pochahontas’ life have been~~

~~different in England versus in America? (Answers may vary but may~~

~~include that England had a very different culture, which included a~~

~~different language, fashion, and religion than what she had grown up~~

~~with.)~~ Sadly, just as Pocahontas and John Rolfe were preparing to

return to Virginia, she became very ill. Pocahontas died on March 21,

1617, at the age of 22, and was buried in England.


Later, in the last years of his life, John Smith spoke of Pocahontas and

said that without her help and the help of the Powhatan, Jamestown

would never have survived.

syllable division patterns at this time as well.


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “ _Consequently_, Pocahontas spent quite a bit

of time in the English settlement—several years, in fact.”


2. _Consequently_ means “as a result of or happening as a result of something else.”


3. Bradley did not study for his test; consequently, he received a bad grade.


4. Have you ever seen something happen consequently? Have you ever

done something consequently? Has something ever happened to you

consequently? What caused the consequence? Try to use the word

_consequently_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If

necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to make

complete sentences: “I consequently . . .” or “consequently happened

because . . . ”)

Do you remember in Chapter 3
you met Tom and his sister Jane?
Today, you will find out more about
Tom and his life in Jamestown�





Tom was glad it was Sunday� This
was the only day of the week that many people didn’t
work in the fields or in their workshops� This made Tom
very happy� On Sunday, Tom was also allowed to hunt
or fish� Before chapel, Tom and his friend William often
set off to catch a rabbit or a fish for the pot� Today was
no exception, and William had arrived at Tom’s house
bright and early�


Tom and William had been hunting and fishing
together ever since Tom first arrived in Jamestown�
William had taught Tom how to use a bow and arrow
and how to catch fish�



_William taught Tom how to use a bow and arrow._

~~**GUIDED READING SUPPORTS**~~


**Pages 46–47**


 - Have students read **pages 46–47** to themselves to find out why Tom liked

Sundays so much.


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question, and have

students answer.


» Sunday was the only day of the week that Tom didn’t work in the fields or

workshops. He and his friend William would go hunting and fishing instead.


Lesson 4 “ Jamestown and the Powhatan”
**99**


**100**



Although Tom had been a city boy, he had taken to
hunting and fishing right away, or, as Mrs� Tucker had
said, “like a duck to water�”


William had learned to hunt, fish, and find food
from a group of Powhatan boys� They had been
welcoming and friendly to him� They taught him that
everything they needed they could get from the land
around them� They were expert hunters and could catch
more fish than William could catch in a week! They
knew what berries and nuts were safe to eat� They also
had yummy food made from corn and beans and squash
that had been grown by their mothers� William told Tom
that without their help, the settlers would never have
survived in the colony�

              - Have students read **pages 48–49** to themselves.


               - Ask, “How did Tom and William, who were city boys, learn to hunt and fish?”


» William learned from the Powhatan boys and he taught Tom.


               - Ask, “Why did William say that the English settlers wouldn’t have survived

without the help of the Powhatan people?”


» Answers may vary but could include that the Powhatan people taught them how

to find food and how live off of the land.


               - Direct students’ attention to the image and caption on **page 49** .


Unit 9 Colonial America


As time went on, however, the Powhatan boys
didn’t visit Jamestown too much anymore� Tension
began to grow between the Powhatan and Jamestown
colonists� The two groups became engaged in conflict�
The Powhatan wanted the colonists to leave their land�
However, the colonists weren’t going away� Quite the
opposite was happening� More and more colonists
were arriving�


_conflict began to grow between them and the Jamestown colonists._

**Pages 50–51**


 - Have students look at the image on **page 51** and read **page 50** to themselves

to fill the blank in the sentence, “Some of the talents the Powhatan have

are  .”


 - Ask, “How has the relationship between the Powhatan and colonists

changed?”


» Answers may vary but could include that both the Powhatan and colonists are no

longer friendly with each other. They don’t visit each other as often.


 - Ask “How did the Powhatan people feel about the English settlers?”


» Answers may vary but could conclude that the Powhatan people felt betrayed

because they welcomed the settlers and helped to teach them skills to survive,

but in return, the English took away their land to grow tobacco.


Lesson 4 “ Jamestown and the Powhatan”
**101**


**102**



On this particular day, the boys were going hunting�


“Come on, Tom� Let’s go and catch our dinner,” he
yelled as he stood in the Tuckers’ open doorway�


“Don’t be out there all day,” exclaimed Mrs� Tucker�


“We won’t be,” Tom replied� With that, the two boys
ran off toward the woodland some distance away�


The boys loved to be in the forest� At this time of the
year, the sights, smells, and sounds were almost magical�
As they crept forward, they **trod** upon a carpet of pine
needles� The sunlight broke through the tall treetops and
shafts of light **illuminated** their path� All around them
they could hear the **scurrying** of forest creatures� They
walked for a while, enjoying the gift of freedom� They
crossed a stream and bent down to drink the water from
their cupped hands� As they did, they both heard the
sudden, sharp sound of a branch breaking�


_William and Tom loved to be in the forest._


52 53


**Pages 52–57**


              - Have students read **pages 52–57** to themselves to find out how Tom and

William’s hunting trip went.


              - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have

students answer.


» Ahanu intended to teach Tom and William how to hunt deer instead of rabbit.


              - Ask, “How might the boys feel upon seeing each other in the forest?”


» Answers may vary but could include they were scared and nervous.


               - Direct students’ attention to the images and captions on **pages 53, 55,**

and **57** .


Unit 9 Colonial America


The branch fell to the ground a few feet away from
them� Both boys looked up instantly� High up in a tree,
about twenty feet above the ground, was a Powhatan
boy, named Ahanu, about the same age as William and
Tom� He was sitting on a wide branch and staring at
them� His bow and arrow were pointed directly at Tom�
Ahanu had heard someone coming� Not knowing who it
was, he raised his bow and arrow, because he felt scared
and nervous about what could happen to him�


William began to speak in a language that Tom did
not recognize� Ahanu replied using words that Tom did
not understand� Then, Ahanu, recognizing his old friend
and deciding to trust him, smiled and climbed down the
tree, landing right beside the boys�

**Instead of the suffixes**    - _er_ and – _est_, use the words _more_ and _most_

when forming comparative and superlative adverbs that end with the

suffixes _–ful, –less, –ing, –ed, –ous_ or that have three or more syllables.


- Tell students to turn to a partner and share words that they know that have

the suffixes _-er_ and _-est_ . Call on several students to share the words they

discussed with the class.


- Remind students that they are learning about adverbs that compare actions.

When comparing two actions, adverbs end with – _er_ . When comparing more

than two actions, adverbs end with – _est_ .


- Remind students that – _er_ and _–est_ are added to adjectives, making them

adverbs that describe verbs.


- Write the prepared sentence on the board in cursive to model handwriting.


   - The curtains on the window by the sink hang lower than the other curtains

in the kitchen.


- Ask students to name the adverb ( _lower_ ) and the verb ( _hang_ ). Draw a triangle

around _lower,_ and arrow it to _hang_ .

- Then, ask students to change this sentence so that the adverb _lowest_ fits.


- Using cursive to model handwriting, write students’ ideas on the board.

Underline the word _lowest_ in the sentences they create.


- Point out how and why the sentence you placed on the board and the

sentences students created differ. Sentences containing adverbs that

end with – _er_ compare two actions. Sentences containing adverbs that end

with – _est_ compare more than two actions and often include the word _all_ .

**112**



~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Universal Access**


- Today, during the writing portion of class, students will develop characters

using description and actions and learn about interaction and dialogue and

their role in characterization.


- With the whole class, develop a character as an example. Write a sample

description of the character on the board using a concept map. The character

could be a colonist in Jamestown, so that students must use historical details

they have learned in the unit to create the character.


- For example, you could create a character named Elizabeth: hard working,

likes to sew, blond-haired, green-eyed, athletic, likes to visit animals at the

swamp, likes to play in the woods with friends.


- Suggest details if students do not have ideas. You could also use Elizabeth as

an example and ask the class to create a friend for Elizabeth. Tell students that

later in class, they will develop individual characters for their narrative pieces.

name was Matoaka [ _mah_ -toe- _ah_ -kah]—and for making Jamestown

(and therefore Virginia) an important economic center. John Rolfe did

this by growing and exporting tobacco and then shipping it out of the

area to places that wanted to buy it. Because of this, tobacco became

a huge part of the Southern colonies’ economy.


The Spanish merchants were the first to bring tobacco to Europe

from the Americas. They had discovered that Native Americans in

various parts of Central and South America used tobacco in a variety

of ways: it was used as medicine and considered an important part of

many ceremonies. In fact, when Christopher Columbus first set foot

in what he called the “New World”, he was greeted by local Natives

carrying gifts of fruit, spears, and dried leaves that had a strong

fragrance. Those leaves were tobacco.


When the English arrived in North America, they, too, found that

many Native Americans grew tobacco. The English settlers’ plan had

not succeeded when they failed to find gold. Some settlers had also

experimented with growing crops such as rice and grapes, but they,

too, were unsuccessful. However, John Rolfe, with the guidance of the

Powhatan, made a **pivotal** contribution to the doomed Jamestown

economy.

Busy Port Scene with Trade Ships
and Tobacco


Tobacco was beginning to become

popular among wealthy Europeans.

However, much of the tobacco









being shipped to Europe was too bitter. John Rolfe introduced a

new tobacco plant to the fields around Jamestown. He brought in a


Unit 9 Colonial America


different plant from the West Indies. Well, actually, he brought in the

seeds to see if they would grow. It was an experiment, but it worked.

The new tobacco plants grew and **flourished** in the red Virginia soil.

And so, the milder Virginia tobacco became much sought after. The

increased demand **transformed** the **colony’s** economy. Jamestown

became a place of wealth and enterprise. Shiploads of Englishmen

and women eagerly set off to make their fortune there.


The gold that the early settlers had sought turned out to be in

the form of an odorous plant. Many people became wealthy as a

result of growing this **cash crop.** No doubt, if you had been there in

Jamestown, you might have heard the sound of gold coins jingling

in the colonists’ pockets. Tobacco was so popular that by the

early 1600s, it had become Virginia’s main crop. Within 50 years,

the colony exported about fifteen million pounds of it to Europe.

Eventually, tobacco was such a widespread cash crop that the

governor had to remind the settlers to grow food crops as well! With

the success of the tobacco industry, the future of Jamestown was

finally secured.


- Read-Aloud pause: Ask students: What is a cash crop? ( _A large crop grown_

_to make money rather than to be eaten by those growing it._ ) Which cash crop

became very successful in Virginia? ( _tobacco_ )



**Student Reader pages 61–63**
Indentured Servants Working
on Tobacco Plantation


However, there was one major drawback

to growing tobacco. During this time, a lot

of people were needed who could to work









very, very hard to **tend** the large **plantations** . People were needed who

could work in harsh conditions, day and night, in all kinds of weather, for

little pay. And finding people willing to do that wasn’t easy.


Lesson 5 “Plantations”
**119**


In the beginning, the new tobacco farmers had mostly **indentured**

**servants** working for them. Indentured servants were people who

had agreed to travel to Virginia (and eventually to other parts of North

America) to work for a period of time for a specific person. The agreed
upon period of time was usually seven years. Often these indentured

servants were poor people from England or other parts of Europe whose

ship passage was purchased for them by their employer. Then, as soon

as they arrived at their new homes, the indentured servants were put to

work. These indentured servants labored long and hard in the tobacco

fields. After the agreed-upon time of service was up, they were free to

venture out on their own.


However, as the **colony** developed, there became a serious shortage of

workers. Some began to think indentured servants would not be enough,

and they started looking for ways to force people to work without having

any freedom. At this point in history, the practice of **slavery** had been

common in the world for several thousand years. A hundred years before

Jamestown was settled, in the Spanish colonies of the Caribbean and

the Portuguese colonies of South America, ships had begun bringing

enslaved Africans to work on **plantations** to the Americas. The practice

unfortunately spread to the English colonies. English colonists, like the

Spanish and Portuguese before them, began to believe that the use of

African slaves was the most efficient way to manage plantations. Before

long, thousands of Africans were captured, brought to the colonies, and

forced to work on plantations. Why did this transition take place?



**Student Reader pages 63–65**
Charles II Showing Land to His Friends


Remember, various European countries

were laying claim to different regions

in the Americas. The Spaniards were

claiming land in most of Central and









**120**



South America and parts of southern North America. French settlers had

claimed land in much of northern North America. Having started to lay


Unit 9 Colonial America


claim to large areas of North America, the British empire sought to claim

huge chunks of land as well. As you recall, England’s very first attempt to

colonize North America on Roanoke Island, off the coast of present-day

North Carolina, failed and became known as the Lost **Colony** .


But in 1663, Charles II, the son of Charles I and grandson of King James

I, decided to try again near the same area. Charles II eagerly gave a

charter, or official document, to eight of his friends that stated that the

land between Virginia and the Spanish colony of Florida now belonged to

him—well, to England, to be precise. Today, this land is North Carolina,

South Carolina, and Georgia—although Georgia was not officially

colonized until much later. Charles II also named part of this land after

himself. This charter was extended in 1665, and more land was divided

up among his friends to manage.


Charles II was particularly generous to those who had helped his family

when his father, Charles I, was killed. At that time, Charles II had been

forced to flee to another country. When Charles II was eventually allowed

to return to England and take the throne, he owed a great deal of money

to a great many people. His way out of debt was to “give” them North

America—well, parts of it, anyway.


Having heard how successful Jamestown was, hundreds and then

thousands of English flocked to the South, and to the Carolinas in

particular. In 1670, a busy seaport was established called Charles

Town. I’m sure you can guess who Charles Town was named after.

**Student Reader pages 65–66**
Tobacco, Rice, and Indigo


In the beginning, many colonists in the

Carolinas established small farms. Before long,



Lesson 5 “Plantations”
**121**


large **plantations** replaced small farms for the purpose of growing cash

crops. The top three cash crops in this area during this time were rice,

tobacco, and **indigo. Indigo** is a tropical plant that is a member of the

pea family that is grown to create blue dye.


The warm climate and marshy stretches of land with fewer trees in the

Carolinas were perfect for growing rice and **indigo**, whereas tobacco

thrived in certain parts of North Carolina. With drier land and more trees,

the geography and climate of Virginia was not conducive to growing rice

and **indigo** ; tobacco was the only cash crop in Jamestown.


As in Virginia, it soon became clear that there was a lot of money to

be made in the Carolinas by growing crops. Many more workers were

needed. The solution the colonists chose to fix this problem was

**slavery** . Unlike indentured servants, enslaved Africans did not come to

North America of their own free will as part of an exchange agreement.


Throughout history, many civilizations have enslaved people. Although

England began trading enslaved Africans later than some other European

countries, it soon became heavily involved in the trading of enslaved

people due to the widespread use of slavery in the English colonies.

**Student Reader pages 67-68**
Triangular Slave Trade


For England, Spain, and Portugal,

the trading of enslaved Africans was

part of a larger trade network among

Europe, West Africa, and the Americas



**122**



(including English colonies in North America, Spanish colonies in the

West Indies, and Portuguese colonies in South America). Some of these


Unit 9 Colonial America


trade routes became known as “triangular trade routes.” If you look at

the map, you will see why. Through these triangular trade networks,

certain goods were traded for other much-needed items and slaves.



**Student Reader pages 67–69**
English Ship Arriving in West African Port


The first side of the triangle was from

Europe to Africa. Portuguese, Spanish, and

English ships laden with manufactured iron

products arrived in the West African ports











to trade their goods for enslaved people and gold. Europeans set up slave

trading centers at these ports. They would purchase people who had been

kidnapped who previously lived freely in Africa. The Europeans would use

their manufactured iron products as payment.


Enslaved Africans were loaded onto ships destined for colonies in

South America, the Caribbean, and North America. The second side

of the triangle, the trade route from West Africa to the Americas,

became known as the Middle Passage.


In the Americas, the slaves were then traded for goods that would

go back to Europe – sugar, tobacco, and other cash crops grown by

plantations run by the Portuguese, Spanish, or English colonists.

This was the third side of the triangular slave trade. Back in Europe,

these cash crops could be traded for European manufactured iron

products, and the trade would continue.


Most enslaved Africans ended up in the Spanish or Portuguese

colonies in the Caribbean and in South America. In the English

colonies in North America, most enslaved Africans were sent to the

colonies in the South. While there were also some slaves in the North,

most farms in the Middle Atlantic and New England regions were

smaller and more easily maintained by families without the need

for additional labor. But the large plantations in the English colonies

in the South were similar to the large plantations of the Caribbean


Lesson 5 “Plantations”
**123**


**124**



and South America and used large amounts of slave labor. But the

large plantations in the English colonies in the South were similar to

the large plantations of the Caribbean and South America, and used

large amounts of slave labor. But even as the use of slave labor grew,

opposition to slavery also grew, driven by colonists morally opposed

to the practice, often based on their beliefs as Christians.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** How do you think the Native Americans felt as more and more

settlers arrived and began building communities? Explain what you think

and why you think so.


» Answers may vary.


2. **Inferential.** How did indentured servitude work? Why did both parties

agree to it?


» Employers and plantation owners in the Americas would pay for people (often poor)

to travel from Europe (and some from Africa), in exchange to agree to work for them

for free for seven years. Both parties agreed to it because employers and plantation

workers needed workers, and indentured servants were provided free travel to the

Americas and a set time period of work. They could then start over in America.


3. **Inferential.** What was the difference between indentured servitude and

enslavement?


» Indentured servants agreed to have free travel to the Americas in exchange

for labor that often lasted seven years. After this time period, they were free. In

contrast, enslaved persons were made to work with no pay for their entire lives.


4. **Inferential.** Why did settlers begin to use enslavement instead of

indentured servitude?


» Settlers began to use enslavement instead of indentured servitude because

plantation owners found it more efficient and cheaper to have free labor to

produce their cash crops with no promise of freedom.

~~**WORD WORK: TRANSFORMED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _transformed_ on the board in cursive to give students an

opportunity to practice decoding the word before discussion. Review syllable

division patterns at this time as well.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The increased demand _transformed_ the

colony’s economy.”


3. _Transformed_ means profoundly changed in form, shape, size, appearance,

attitude, or in another way.


4. When the princess kissed the frog, it suddenly transformed into a prince.


5. Have you ever seen, or heard of, something that transformed? How did that

thing change? Have you ever transformed something? Try to use the word

_transformed_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If necessary,

guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to make complete sentences:

“transformed because . . . ” or “I transformed. . .”)


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the

word _transformed_ ?


7. Use a _Discussion_ activity for follow-up. Have students discuss different

ways that things can transform. Discuss different types of transformations

in humans and animals as they grow. For example, students can discuss

metamorphosis, or how habitats, like forests, can transform. For example, a

fire can burn down a forest and transform it. Make sure that students use the

word _transformed_ in a complete sentence as they talk about it.


8. You may wish to have students discuss how different abstract things within

a person or society may transform. For example, they could discuss how

the lives of many Native Americans transformed over time or how the

manufacturing of transportation (from ships, to horse-drawn carriages, to

trains, to cars, to airplanes) has transformed the way we travel over time!


~~**COLONIAL AMERICA ACROSTICS (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.12.A**~~


 - In three columns, write the letters of the names of the three colonial regions

vertically on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard: _SOUTHERN; NEW_

_ENGLAND; MIDDLE ATLANTIC._ As a class, use the letters of each word to

create an acrostic about each region, describing what has been learned thus

far about the geography, climate, industries, and/or culture. Each letter of the

Lesson 5 “Plantations”
**125**


**126**



region may be used to begin a word, phrase, or sentence. You may also wish

to list more than one word for each letter. Encourage use of vocabulary and

geography terms. For example, for _SOUTHERN,_ you might list the following

(and add other words later):


S—Settlements; (Savannah)

O—One crop was tobacco; (Oglethorpe)

U—Unprepared

T—Tobacco was a main crop in the South; (Tomochichi)

H—Humid climate

E—English colonies; (Europeans)

R—Roanoke Island; (Rolfe)

N—Native Americans


**Note:** You may wish to display these acrostics for the duration of the unit

and add to them as more information is relayed about each region. You may

also wish to create a new acrostic for each lesson if applicable. The acrostics

you create will be revisited as part of a review exercise in Pausing Point 1 and

Lesson 10.


 - Pass out lined paper to each student. Have students create their own acrostics

and keep them in their Colonial America notebook or folder to update and

_George told Seth about being forced to work on a tobacco_
_**plantation**_ _._



“On a tobacco **plantation**, slaves work from sunup
to sundown,” George had said� “You have no time off�
You have to **tend** to those tobacco leaves all the time�
When one task is done, another one comes along before
you know it�”


Seth didn’t like the sound of that one bit and he
hoped he didn’t end up growing tobacco� On a rice
**plantation**, enslaved people had certain tasks to do�
When they were finished, they could do the chores that
they needed to do for themselves� Although enslaved
people on a rice **plantation** spent less time in the fields,
it wasn’t true that life on a rice **plantation** was easier
than life on a tobacco **plantation** - Growing rice was a
dangerous business�


Rice grows in water� People who were enslaved had
to spend hours in swamp-like fields **tending** to the rice
crops� The rice crops and the enslaved people weren’t the
only ones in the water� There were snakes and alligators�
That’s how Seth’s mother had become sick with
swamp fever�

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Language**


- Prepare to display the Comparative and Superlative Adverbs Poster (Digital

Projection DP.U9.L3.2).


**Comparative and Superlative Adverbs**


**Comparative adverbs** compare two actions to show that one is greater or

more. The suffix – _er_ is added to adverbs.


**Superlative adverbs** compare more than two actions to show that one is

greatest or most. The suffix – _est_ is added to adverbs.


Instead of the suffixes – _er_ and – _est_, use the words _more_ and _most_ when

forming comparative and superlative adverbs that end with the suffixes –

_ful_, – _less_, – _ing_, – _ed_, – _ous_ or that have three or more syllables.


- Write the following sentence in cursive on the board, and cover it or write it on

sentence strips to be displayed during the Grammar lesson:


She arrived at our house than I thought she would. (sooner, soonest)


- Create the following Spelling Table on chart paper, or prepare Digital

Projection DP.U9.L6.1.


- The decodable passage for this lesson, “A Day in Anna’s Life in Maryland,” can

be found in the Teacher Resources section. You will use the passage to practice

the decoding skills taught in this lesson during small-group instruction,

partner work, or independent reading.


Unit 9 Colonial America


**Reading**


 - Prepare to add to the Colonial America: Important Persons anchor chart after

the reading.


Note to Teacher


During this week, students will review spellings of /oi/ spelled ‘oi’ and ‘oy.’

Students should be familiar with these spellings, as they were reviewed in

Grade 2. The following chart is provided for your review.


 - Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


    - ‘oi’ is generally used before a consonant spelling ( _oil_, _coin_ ) or a

consonant cluster.


    - ‘oy’ is just the opposite. It tends to fall at the end of a word or syllable ( _boy_,

_toy_, _destroy_, _boyish_ ). It is only rarely followed by a consonant spelling.


Note to Teacher


In this unit, students will focus on four academic vocabulary words, two

of which are _create_ and _design_ . By academic vocabulary, we mean words

that support reading comprehension and may appear across a variety of

materials, in language arts and in content areas. These words can be found

in textbooks, assignment directions, and assessments. Understanding

academic vocabulary may contribute to improved performance on

assignments and assessments, as these words appear often in directions to

students. These words may appear on end-of-year assessments that third

graders may take. Where applicable, use the words throughout the unit,

not just as they might refer to reading selections but also with regard to

spelling, grammar, morphology, and comprehension. They may also appear

in directions, assessments, spelling lists, and discussion questions, among

other places.


Lesson 6 “The Founding of Maryland and Georgia”
**141**


**142**




   - To _create_ means to make something that has not been made.


   - To _design_ means to formulate or make plans to create something.


You are encouraged to define these words for students and use both of these

words throughout the school day so that students may experience multiple

uses of them.


**Universal Access**


- Make a timeline with student bodies. Use Activity Page 1.3. Assign a few students

with a specific event, and have each student hold a piece of paper that highlights

that event, including the name of the event, the year, and if possible, a related

image. For example, a student could write “1607, Jamestown was founded,” and

draw the shape of Virginia with a star where Jamestown is located.


- Some students will represent events, while others will help arrange the line

of students in the proper order. When students think they are finished, ask

a student leader to check that students are in the correct order using the

timeline students have added to during each lesson on Activity Page 1.3.


- Hand out the following questions as flashcards, with the question on one side,

answer on the other, and ask students to quiz each other in partners or small

groups. Or you can review these questions as a whole class, as discussed in

the lesson.


   - What cash crop saved Jamestown and helped other Southern colonies to

prosper? (tobacco)


   - What is the name given to the settlers whose passage to North America

was paid for by someone else and who, in return, agreed to work for that

person for a time, usually seven years? (indentured servants)


   - What group of people gradually became the largest work force on

plantations after indentured servants? (enslaved Africans)


   - What three crops were planted as cash crops in the Carolinas? (tobacco,

rice, and indigo)


   - What was the name given to the set of trade routes from Europe, Africa,

and North America ? (triangular trade route)


   - What was the name given to the part of that route from West Africa to

America? (the Middle Passage)

- Tell students that today they are going to hear about several lawmaking

groups. One they will hear about is called Parliament. Parliament is the

lawmaking group in the government of Great Britain (which is made up of

the countries of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland). Parliament

has many members, and the leading member is the British Prime Minister.

In today’s Read-Aloud, the words _assembly_ and _house_ are used to describe

lawmaking groups in the colonies. You have already heard of the House of

Burgesses, which was the governing group in the colony of Virginia. Keep in

mind that the groups in each colony were distinct and separate, but at the

same time, each group was influenced by the rules and laws of Parliament in

Great Britain. The colonists would consider these laws when they began to

make laws for themselves. If certain laws worked for them, they adopted them.


- Have students take out Activity Page 6.1. Explain that students will identify the

central idea and supporting details throughout the Read-Aloud.


~~**READ-ALOUD: “THE FOUNDING OF MARYLAND AND GEORGIA” (20 MIN.)**~~

Pirates Taking Over a Trading Ship


With so much trade going on, and the

abundance of ships laden with valuable

cargo, it was **inevitable,** or unavoidable,

that pirates would make an appearance





in this story. The English colonies, particularly those in the Southern

region and the West Indies, became well known as places where pirates

hid from the law. These pirates were known as buccaneers.


Buccaneers were a group of men from England, France, and Holland.

They terrorized sailors and captured trade ships in this region. Because

of the success of these infamous pirates, some countries were forced to

send naval ships to accompany their trade ships safely back across the

Atlantic to ports in Europe. The Americas were turning out to be a place

where many different groups of Europeans, including these different

gangs of pirates, felt they had the opportunity to become rich.


Lesson 6 “The Founding of Maryland and Georgia”
**145**


Back on land, the English colonies were expanding. Today you will

learn about two more colonies—Maryland and Georgia. Both of these

colonies have an interesting history. However, the development of

Maryland and Georgia was a little different from that of Virginia. Let’s

begin with Maryland.


You learned about the large **plantations** that were prevalent in the

South. Maryland was considered a Southern **colony**, though it was

geographically in the Middle Atlantic region. Although there were many

small farms in Maryland, there were a fair number of large **plantations**

in the southern portion. Like Virginia, Maryland’s economy was based

on tobacco agriculture as a cash crop.



**Student Reader pages 82–83**
Charles I and Queen Maria;
Lord Baltimore


Before he was killed, Charles I had given

a large section of land north of Virginia

to a friend. This time, the lucky recipient

of land was Sir George Calvert.









**146**



Sir Calvert, who was also known as Lord Baltimore, received this

generous gift in 1632. Sir Calvert was a Roman Catholic. In England

at that time, Roman Catholics were not very well-liked because

they were not part of the official Church of England. The Church of

England, also known as the Anglican Church, had split apart from

the Roman Catholic Church. Many people in England at that time

believed that Roman Catholics would be more loyal to the Catholic

pope than to the king—and they did not like that. However, because

King Charles’s wife, Queen Henrietta Maria, was Catholic, Charles

tried to be respectful of Catholics for her sake. Delighted by Charles’s

gift, Sir Calvert named his **colony** Maryland in honor of Queen Maria.


Maryland was different from Virginia because it was controlled by

Sir Calvert’s family. Sir Calvert’s son Cecil determined that Maryland

would be a safe haven for Catholics. In the beginning, it was. In fact,

in 1634, Cecil’s brother, Leonard Calvert, led the first group of


Unit 9 Colonial America


Catholics to this colony. Leonard Calvert later became the first

governor of Maryland.


The colonists and the Native Americans in Maryland established

peaceful relations. In addition, the colonists did not waste time

searching for gold but instead immediately established farms and

trading posts. They soon settled into organized communities with laws

that were clearly defined.


It wasn’t long before word got out that Maryland was quite a nice

place to live. Europeans searching for a better life free of poverty

and religious persecution journeyed to this **colony** . And it wasn’t

just Roman Catholics who came. Other Christians who belonged

to different churches came to settle in Maryland, too. Before

long, Maryland became known as a place that practiced religious

freedom—so much so that, in 1649, Lord Baltimore had the Maryland

General Assembly pass the Act of Toleration. This law stated that all

Christians in Maryland would be tolerated, or allowed the freedom

to worship. This law **confirmed** that Christians from different

churches—Protestants, Catholics, and others—could practice their

religion without **interference.**







**Student Reader pages 84–85**
Maryland General Assembly Passing Act
of Toleration / Debtor family in Georgia


The last Southern **colony** to be

founded was Georgia. One day, a

member of Parliament in London,





England, named James Oglethorpe had a brainstorm. Oglethorpe had

noticed that English jails were overflowing with **debtors** . In England

during this time, people were put in jail, called a **debtor’s** prison, if

they were unable to pay their **debts** . Sometimes these jailed **debtors**

owed a little amount of money, and sometimes they owed a lot.

Oglethorpe had noticed that these debtors—even those who owed a

relatively small amount of money—were often left in jail, without any

way of paying back the money they owed.


Lesson 6 “The Founding of Maryland and Georgia”
**147**


Oglethorpe’s unique idea was to set up a new **colony** in North

America where these **debtors** would be given a second chance.

They would be given land so they could begin a new life. They could

work to pay back the money they owed, and then their **debt** would

be forgiven.



**Student Reader pages 85–86**
Oglethorpe Receiving Charter from
King George II


In 1732, the then-king, George II, liked

this idea. He gave Oglethorpe a charter

saying that he could take a band of

**debtors** from England to the area of land









**148**



between South Carolina and Spanish Florida. The British Parliament

supported this venture by giving Oglethorpe money and ships to make

the journey. Upon reaching this land, Oglethorpe named it Georgia after

his royal majesty. (Kings just expected lands that were new to Europeans

to be named after them.) Georgia was even larger back then than the

state of Georgia is today. It included much of present-day Alabama and

Mississippi.


However, even though sending **debtors** to the colonies seemed like a

brilliant plan to Oglethorpe and the king, it was difficult to **persuade**

many **debtors** to leave their families and homes and sail three thousand

miles across the Atlantic Ocean to a place where they might not be

welcomed with open arms. Once they arrived, the **debtors** would have to

build their own homes, as well as gather, hunt, and grow their own food.

Many **debtors** preferred to serve their time in jail in England rather than

face the unknown in the Americas. In all, about one hundred **debtors**

agreed to go on the journey to North America. They began the **laborious**

task of helping to turn Georgia into a **colony** .


Unit 9 Colonial America


**Student Reader pages 86–87**
Oglethorpe Meeting with
Chief Tomochichi


As soon as he arrived in Georgia, the

leader of the Yamacraw, a group of

Native Americans in the region, met with









Oglethorpe. Chief Tomochichi [toh-moh chee-chee] and the Yamacraw

established trade with the British and gave them permission to settle

there. Chief Tomochichi and Oglethorpe worked hard to establish

alliances between their people. In appreciation, Oglethorpe invited

some of the Yamacraw to visit England. Oglethorpe and his band of

debtors developed the first European settlement in Georgia: Savannah.


**Student Reader pages 87–89**
Regional Map of Colonial America


Of course, King George had another

motive for sending settlers to Georgia

besides helping **debtors** start a

new life. As you can see on the map,

Georgia is located between the Carolinas and what was then known

as Spanish Florida. At this point, the British had not established

any official colonies to the south of South Carolina, so this was the

perfect way to protect the colonies from the Spanish empire. ~~Remind~~

~~students that the green areas on the map represent other lands that~~

~~Native Americans inhabited but that had not yet been reached by~~

~~European settlers.~~


Georgia served as a **buffer** zone to separate English colonies from

the Spanish colonies. This would also allow colonists to keep an eye

on the Spanish monarchy’s ambitions for growth in North America.


But King George did not realize that the Spaniards had already claimed

the very area he had in mind. It wasn’t long before there was armed

confrontation between the Spaniards and the British. As time went by,

more and more settlers arrived in Georgia. Some of them did not get


Lesson 6 “The Founding of Maryland and Georgia”
**149**


**150**



along with the Yamacraw people as well as Oglethorpe and his followers

had. The Spaniards continued to stake their claim to the land, and

buccaneers often attacked vital trade ships. This new **colony**, the last

one to be created, suffered its fair share of problems in its early days.


Whereas few English **debtors** would agree to come and settle in

Georgia, many poor Europeans from other countries began to arrive

and establish farms in this **colony** . They came primarily from Ireland

and Germany. Georgian farmers liked the idea of **plantation** farming,

as it had proven successful in other Southern colonies. However, the

colonists soon found farming to be a backbreaking job and insisted that

they needed help. Under the leadership of James Oglethorpe, Georgia

banned slavery in 1735. However, it was legalized by royal decree in 1751,

at the urging of English investors in the colony. After that, colonists in

Georgia began to rely more and more on the labor of enslaved people

from Africa, especially to farm their rice plantations.


Before long, Georgia became a **colony** identified with **plantation** life

and the heavy use of enslaved laborers. Within one hundred years of

being established, the state of Georgia had more **plantations** than any

other state in the South.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What four new reasons did you hear about today that help explain

why people left their homes in Europe behind to take a perilous boat ride

across the Atlantic?


» Christians came to Maryland to escape persecution and to be in a safe haven

where they could worship freely; debtors came to Georgia to work to pay back

their debts; poor Europeans came to start a new life.


2. **Inferential.** What problem in the colonies seemed to be solved at the time,

but soon prompted a terrible new problem?


» Farmers needed help with their plantations, so they brought enslaved Africans

to the colonies. This seemed to solve the need for workers, but it also spread

the terrible practice of slavery from the Portuguese and Spanish colonies to the

English colonies.


3. **Literal.** Who had the unique idea to create the colony of Georgia?


» James Oglethorpe, a member of Parliament


Unit 9 Colonial America


4. **Literal.** How did Oglethorpe attempt to establish a positive relationship

with the Yamacraw people in this area?


» He talked with them and their chief about trading and sharing the land.


5. **Literal.** For whom was the colony of Georgia named?


» King George II of Great Britain

~~**WORD WORK: INEVITABLE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _inevitable_ on the board in cursive to give students an

opportunity to practice decoding the word before discussion. Review

syllable division patterns at this time as well.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “With so much trade going on, and the

abundance of ships laden with valuable cargo, it was _inevitable_ that pirates

would make an appearance in this story.”


3. _Inevitable_ means unavoidable or unstoppable, and describes something

that is going to happen whether you like it or not.


4. When Sherman ate his birthday cupcake, it was inevitable that the icing

would disappear before the cake.


5. Has something ever happened to you that you felt was inevitable? What

happened? Why do you think it was inevitable? Try to use the word

_inevitable_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If necessary,

guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to make complete

sentences: “I thought it was inevitable that . . . ” or “was inevitable

because . . . ”)


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the

word _inevitable_ ?

**Chapter**

**Early Days**
**in Georgia**
### **9**

Hello, my name is Sarah� My family
and I are from England� We have been in
Savannah, Georgia, for five years now� We
left England in November, 1737, onboard
a sailing ship called the _Anne_ - It took us
two months to get to these shores� I will never forget
how **bitterly** cold it was on the deck of the ship� The
wind felt worse than a stinging insect when it touched
my face� The waves were dark, gray, and frightening�
They tossed our ship about, here, there, and everywhere�
I feared that those giant waves would **devour** us�


Our first stop in North America was Charleston�
After that, we made our way to the town I now live in
called Savannah� Savannah is in the English **colony**
of Georgia� It’s not quite a town yet, like the ones
in England, but it will be� When we first arrived in
Savannah, my mother called it a wilderness� I was six
years old then� Now, I am eleven�

**Pages 90–97**


               - Tell students to read **pages 90–97** to themselves to find the answer to the

question: “How is the colony of Georgia different from other colonies you have

learned about?”


» Mr. Oglethorpe wanted to bring debtors, to give them a second chance rather than

have them stay in jail in England. He also wanted mostly skilled people to come to

Georgia, which would be the only way to survive in the colony.


Unit 9 Colonial America


Mr� James Oglethorpe and twenty-one other English
gentlemen had been granted a charter by King George II
of England� The charter gave them permission to create
an English **colony** under English law� The charter states
that they are the trustees, or governors, of this **colony**,
meaning they are in charge� However, everyone knows
that it is really Mr� Oglethorpe who is in charge because
he makes all of the decisions� I have also heard that Mr�
Oglethorpe wants this **colony** to succeed so much that
he sold some of his own property in England to earn
money for Georgia�



My parents aren’t **debtors**   - They were chosen by
Mr� Oglethorpe for their skills� My father is a carpenter
and my mother is a seamstress� Mr� Oglethorpe wanted
mostly skilled people to come to Savannah� He said
that would be the only way we would survive here� I
have heard the grownups talk about what happened to
the first settlers in Virginia� Some of them died because
they were not skilled enough to make their way� Many
others died because of cold and hunger though� So Mr�
Oglethorpe and the other trustees chose mostly farmers,
merchants, bakers, carpenters, and blacksmiths to be the



Lesson 6 “The Founding of Maryland and Georgia”

**156**



When we first arrived in Savannah, we lived in tents�
Altogether, there were forty families� We worked very
hard to build the wall that now surrounds us� Inside the
wall, we built our homes� Everyone worked, even the
children� Slowly, our town began to take shape� There is
still a lot of work to be done, though� It does not yet look
like the busy city of London that we left behind�


While some people are unhappy about how strict
Mr� Oglethorpe is being in the colony, my parents say
that Mr� Oglethorpe is a wise man� When we first arrived,
the chief of a local **tribe** called the Yamacraw offered to
make peace with him in exchange for trade� The chief’s
name is Tomochichi� Tomochichi even traveled back to
England with Mr� Oglethorpe when he went to get more
supplies for us�

1. **Evaluative.** How do you think it felt to know that you could be attacked at

any time?


» Answers may vary but could include that the colonists were afraid. The text

says that Sarah’s father says that it is only a matter of time before the colonists

will have to fight the Spaniards for the land south of their colony. This scares

Sarah. Students may say that being afraid all of the time would make a person

feel unsafe.


2. **Evaluative.** Do you think King George II sent soldiers to protect

the colonists?


» Answers may vary but could include that Mr. Oglethorpe was very determined to

have this colony be successful. He even sold some of his property in England

to earn money for Georgia. Students may feel that a man like Mr. Oglethorpe

would be very convincing when he spoke to King George II so that the king would

send soldiers.

**Superlative adverbs** compare more than two actions to show that one is

greatest or most. The suffix – _est_ is added to adverbs.


Instead of the suffixes – _er_ and – _est_, use the words _more_ and _most_ when

forming comparative and superlative adverbs that end with the suffixes –

_ful_, – _less_, – _ing_, – _ed_, – _ous_ or that have three or more syllables.


 - Uncover the sentence you placed on the board in advance, and have students

read it aloud while they fill in the blank and provide immediate corrective

feedback.


She arrived at our house than I thought she would. (sooner)


 - Remind students that the suffix – _er_ is added to an adverb when two actions

are being compared and the suffix – _est_ is added when more than two actions

are being compared.


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 6.4 and fill in the blanks of the first four

sentences. When students have finished, tell them that they will now write

three sentences as you dictate them. Read the following sentences aloud:


1. I ate my breakfast faster than my sister did so I could play.


2. It looked like the hawk was soaring the highest of all the birds in the sky.

- Point to the Challenge Words on the board. Explain to students that the

Challenge Words, _especially_ and _whole_ / _hole_, are also part of the spelling list

and are words used very often. The Challenge Words do not follow the spelling

pattern this week and need to be memorized.


- Explain to students that _whole_ and _hole_ are homophones. Homophones sound

alike but have different meanings. Homophones may or may not be spelled the

same. _Whole_ and _hole_ have the same sound /oe/.


- Tell students to turn and talk to a partner and explain the different meanings

of _whole_ and _hole_ . Ask: “How are these meanings distinct from each other

despite both words having the /oe/ sound?” Have students create their own

sentences using both words and share them with each other. Call on several

students to share their sentences with the class.


- Use the Challenge Words in sentences as examples for students: “Jeremy likes

chocolate ice cream, _especially_ double chocolate fudge ice cream.” “She just

bought a new skirt, and it already has a _hole_ in it.” “I was surprised that my

friend could eat a _whole_ pizza by himself!”


- Remind students that this week, they again have a Content Word. Review with

them that the Content Word is a little harder than the other words. (If students try

to spell the Content Word on the assessment and do not get it right, they will not

be penalized. Simply correct it as you do the other words and applaud their effort.

There should not be a penalty for not trying or misspelling the Content Word. The

important thing is they tried something that was a stretch for them academically.)


- Tell students that the Content Word, _Savannah_, does not follow the spelling

pattern for this week. _Savannah_ is a content-related word, as English

settlements were built in Savannah, Georgia.


- Display or project the following table (Digital Projection DP.U9.L6.1).

Unit 9 Colonial America


 - Ask students to refer to the spellings for /oi/ on **page 4** of the **Individual**

**Code Chart** . Point out that there are two spellings for /oi/.


 - Ask students which spelling is most frequently used. (‘oi’ > /oi/)


 - Ask students to tell you which words to list under the ‘oi’ > /oi/ header. Briefly

explain the meaning of each word.


 - Continue with ‘oy’ > /oi/ until all words have been listed under the appropriate

header. Briefly explain the meaning of each word.


 - Practice the words as follows during the remaining time. Call on a student

to read any word on the table. Then, have the student use the word in a

meaningful sentence. After the student says the sentence, have them ask

the class: “Does the sentence make sense?” If the class says, “Yes,” then the

student puts a check mark in front of the word and calls another student to

come to the front and take a turn. If the class says, “No,” have the student try

again or call on another student to come to the front and use the word in a

meaningful sentence. This continues until all of the words are used or time

has run out.


 - Tell students that this table will remain on display until the assessment so that

students may refer to it during the week.


 - Tell students they will take home Activity Page 6.5 with this week’s spelling

words to share with a family member.


**Note:** Have students read the decodable passage, “A Day in Anna’s Life in

Maryland,” that you prepared in advance to practice decoding words with

/oi/ spelled ‘oi’ and ‘oy’. Encourage students to practice reading this passage

multiple times to increase their fluency. Circulate while students read to

provide immediate, corrective feedback to students after decoding the

passage.

**Comparative and Superlative Adverbs**


**Comparative adverbs** compare two actions to show that one is greater or

more. The suffix – _er_ is added to adverbs.


**Superlative adverbs** compare more than two actions to show that one is

greatest or most. The suffix – _est_ is added to adverbs.


Instead of the suffixes – _er_ and – _est_, use the words _more_ and _most_

when forming comparative and superlative adverbs that end with the

suffixes – _ly_ or that have three or more syllables.


- Write the following words on the board or chart paper and cover them for use

during the Language lesson:


   - quietly

Pilgrims and others preparing to board
the Mayflower


On a September day in 1620, about

a hundred or so men, women, and

children **boarded** a small wooden ship


called the _Mayflower,_ was bound for North America. You really do have

to wonder why people would put their lives at risk to sail across a vast

ocean in an overcrowded ship. They must have had very good reasons.


I’m sure you remember King James; Jamestown was named after

him. Well, King James was not just the head of England at this time.

He was also the head of the Church of England. And King James took

his job as head of the church very seriously. He felt that the Church

of England was the only established church in the country, and

everyone should be part of it. The king also believed that if you didn’t

support the Church of England, you might not support the king. So

King James did not allow people to follow any other religion. Anyone

who broke this law could be severely punished. In fact, many people

were imprisoned, killed, or forced to leave the country.

As you can imagine, this law made a lot of people unhappy, especially

those people who wanted to be free to worship as they wished. Two

groups in particular were angry with the king. They were known as

the Puritans and the Separatists. The Puritans actually belonged

to the Church of England. However, the Puritans believed that the

Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church, had some

incorrect interpretations of the Christian Bible. They wanted a way

of life based on how they interpreted the Bible. The Puritans wanted

to stay in the church, but they wanted the Church to be more **pure,**

or free of beliefs they didn’t agree with. The Separatists, on the other

hand, wanted people to have the freedom to worship as they pleased,

even if it meant _separating_ from the Church of England. King James

refused to listen to either group and viewed them both as nothing

more than troublemakers.


- Read-Aloud Pause: Direct students to make a prediction on Activity Page 7.2.


Frustrated and unhappy with the king, a group of Separatists left

England in 1608 for the Netherlands. There they could practice their

religion without fear. However, about ten years later, a group of them

decided to return to England because they missed their homes. They

had a plan, though. They did not intend to live in England. Instead,

they planned to board a ship and move to a new land—a land that

would be their own. They had decided to go to Virginia. King James

was delighted!

Company to allow them to make the trip. He also persuaded the

company to give them a small piece of land to settle on when they

got there. If you recall, it was the Virginia Company that had paid for

the English settlers to travel to Virginia in 1606.


Before setting off, these Separatists became known as Pilgrims _._ The

word _pilgrim_ is used to describe a person who goes on a **pilgrimage,**

or a journey for religious reasons. It was thought that this word best

described what these people were doing.


**Show Image U9.L7.3**
Pilgrims and others preparing to board
the Mayflower


And so, this is where we begin, in

September 1620, as the Pilgrims

board the _Mayflower._ It is important

to note that not everyone on

board the _Mayflower_ was a Pilgrim. There were military officers,

adventurers, merchants, craftsmen, indentured servants, and would
be farmers, too. Because they were not part of their church, and the

Pilgrims were not familiar with them, the Pilgrims called the other

travelers on board the ship Strangers _._ Regardless of what they were

called, all of these people hoped for a better life and were willing to

put their lives at risk to get it.


**Show Image U9.L7.4**
Mayflower in stormy seas


The journey to Virginia did not start

out well. Very strong winds made

the voyage a difficult one. The winds

were so strong that they **battered**

the ship and blew it off course. It took

more than two months to complete the journey. When they finally

arrived, they were not in Virginia.

At the first sight of land, the captain instructed that they drop anchor.

Although those on board were happy to see land after two months

on board a ship, it soon became clear that they were not where they

were supposed to be. For one thing, the weather was much colder

than they were prepared for.

Signing the Mayflower Compact


Because they were far north of the

area granted to them by the Virginia

Company, the Pilgrim leaders on

board drew up a plan outlining how

their colony should be governed—even before landing their ship. That’s

right. Right there on the ship, they decided what the rules should be and

who would make them. The main objective, or goal, of the group—which

included both Pilgrims and so-called Strangers—was to work together in

peace and fairness to make their colony a success.


This document, written by William Bradford and the Pilgrims’

religious leader, William Brewster, became known as the **Mayflower**

**Compact.** Most of the men on board the _Mayflower_ signed the

agreement (forty-one of them to be exact). Women and children

did not sign the compact. Today, the Mayflower Compact is a very

important document because it was the first document in the English

colonies to guarantee **self-government.**


The group sent an exploratory party in a rowboat to investigate the

coastline while everyone else remained on board the ship. The men

in this party encountered Wampanoag Native Americans. The two

groups shot at each other with muskets, and bows and arrows. The

English party advanced and explored an area that became known as

Provincetown, on the very northern tip of Cape Cod, in what is now

the state of Massachusetts.

**Show Image U9.L7.6**
Arrival of the Pilgrims


Based on information provided to

them by the exploratory party, the

Pilgrims and others did not settle

the area that became known as

Provincetown. Instead, they sailed

farther to a rocky harbor area they named Plymouth, which was

fitting because the group had first departed England from the port

of Plymouth.


Some historians have recorded that the passengers on board the

_Mayflower_ took their first steps in North America when they alighted onto

a large, granite boulder on the shoreline. This boulder is now known as

Plymouth Rock. Though some believe the story of the Pilgrims landing on

this specific rock, it may be a legend. What we do know is that the date

was December 21, 1620. The Pilgrims had arrived in North America.


Sadly, the settlers were not prepared for how bitterly cold the winters

could be in New England. In addition, the journey had been so terrible

that many of the settlers were sick. Without warm clothing and

shelter, and with very little food, it was difficult to survive. Almost half

of them died during that first winter.

Arrival of the Pilgrims


Based on information provided to

them by the exploratory party, the

Pilgrims and others did not settle

the area that became known as

Provincetown. Instead, they sailed farther to a rocky harbor area

they named Plymouth, which was fitting because the group had first

departed England from the port of Plymouth.


Some historians have recorded that the passengers on board the

_Mayflower_ took their first steps in North America when they alighted

onto a large, granite boulder on the shoreline. This boulder is now

known as Plymouth Rock. Though some believe the story of the

Pilgrims landing on this specific rock, it may be a legend. What we

do know is that the date was December 21, 1620. The Pilgrims had

arrived in North America.


Sadly, the settlers were not prepared for how bitterly cold the winters

could be in New England. In addition, the journey had been so terrible

that many of the settlers were sick. Without warm clothing and

shelter, and with very little food, it was difficult to survive. Almost half

of them died during that first winter.

Squanto Helps the Pilgrims


Spring could not come quickly

enough. When it did arrive, the

settlers got to work experimenting

with planting seeds for crops and

building homes.


One day, a Native American named Samoset appeared in the colony.

Surprisingly, Samoset spoke some English. Samoset told the settlers

about a Native American named Tisquantum (also called Squanto),

who not only spoke English, but had been to England and Spain.


It was clear to Samoset that the English settlers needed help, and

he went to get it. Before long Squanto arrived with the Wampanoag

chief, Massasoit [mass-uh- _so_ -it]. It appeared the settlers had arrived

in an area inhabited by the Wampanoag. Squanto was not actually a

Wampanoag, but he joined the tribe when the people of his own tribe

had died from a disease epidemic.


Squanto believed the Wampanoag could trade with the settlers. He

advised Chief Massasoit to make peace with them. It is believed that

Squanto showed the settlers how to grow crops such as corn, squash,

and beans in the New England soil. Squanto also showed the settlers

where to hunt and fish, and which local plants were good to eat.

a previous prediction was correct on Activity Page 7.2.


**Show Image U9.L8.3**
Harvest Feast


As their crops grew in the warm New

England sunshine, and the men hunted

and fished in the woods and rivers,

the settlers became more **optimistic.**


Unit 9 Colonial America


And so, when the first fall came, the settlers had enough food to see

them safely through the next winter. They were very grateful. They were

grateful to God, and they were grateful for the Wampanoag people. It

was time to hold a celebration of thanksgiving.


One of the settlers wrote that Chief Massasoit came to the

thanksgiving celebration with ninety Wampanoag men. The occasion

lasted for several days as the settlers and their guests feasted on

deer, duck, lobster, fish, cornbread, pumpkin, squash, and berries.

They hunted, played games, and ran races. This celebration of the

Pilgrims and the Wampanoag is often called “the first Thanksgiving.”


The friendship and relative peace between the Wampanoag and the

settlers lasted for many years—even decades after Squanto’s death.

Eventually, however, as more and more new settlers poured into this

area of North America, the friendly relations broke down. But for now,

in this part of our story, this land and new life with religious freedom

were very much what the Pilgrims had hoped for.

the Pilgrim children Mary and
Remember Allerton and Love and
Wrestling Brewster? In the beginning of the
story, they were collecting firewood and playing in the
forest� Then, you traveled back in time and learned how
they had arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts� In this
chapter, we will continue to find out more about their
early experiences in Plymouth�


Years earlier, when the Pilgrims and their children
arrived in Plymouth in 1621, they had built shelters by
day and returned to their ship by night to sleep�

they arrived?”


- When students have finished reading, restate the question and have

students answer.


» The Pilgrims had a difficult experience. There were cold winters and they didn’t

have a lot of food. Many of them passed away.


- Ask, “What two things enabled the Pilgrims to survive?”


» People who were part of a Native tribe called the Patuxet had died and left fields

that were not in use, which meant the English colonists did not have to clear the

forests before planting. Also, a Native American named Squanto and his friend

Samoset came to the aid of the Pilgrims.


- Direct students’ attention to the images and captions on **pages 113** and **115.**


Unit 9 Colonial America


In the winter, the Pilgrims shivered in the cold
as they buried those that had not survived� Mary,
Remember, Love, and Wrestling had wondered if they
would survive�


While the settlers endured many hardships, the
Native Americans in this region faced them as well� One
tribe, the Patuxet, who had lived in the area, had created
fields for planting� Sadly, many members of this tribe
had already died from contagious diseases� Because of
this, their fields were not in use� This meant that the
hungry and weary English colonists did not have to
clear the forests before planting� In addition, there was
another key factor to the Pilgrims’ survival: the help of
the Wampanoag, the Native Americans living in the area�


Having experienced the loss of his own people, a
Native American called Squanto came to the aid of the
Pilgrims� Squanto’s friend Samoset agreed to help too�
Both of these Native Americans spoke English� Squanto
spoke English well� In 1605, he had been taken to
England by an English explorer�



_Squanto and Samoset helped the Pilgrims._

Squanto and Samoset showed the Pilgrims how to
plant corn, squash, and beans and how to make these
crops grow in the poor soil� Squanto also taught people
to recognize berries and fruits that could be eaten and
where the best places to fish were� Wrestling Brewster
often talked of how he had feared these people at
first� But when they helped the settlers, Wrestling had
changed his mind� Love and Wrestling had gone fishing
with Squanto� Squanto gave the Pilgrims hope�


The colonists had also made peace with a local

and protect each other� They agreed to trade with each
other, too�

and how to make these crops grow in poor soil. Squanto also taught the Pilgrims to

recognize berries and fruits that could be eaten and where the best places to fish were.

» They made peace with the Wampanoag tribe. Both sides agreed to help and

protect each other as well as trade.


Unit 9 Colonial America


Slowly, the days grew warmer and the Pilgrims
became happier� They were no longer cold and hungry�
The first fall was one of the most precious memories
Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had� The crops
had grown well and their harvest was abundant� Besides
farming, the colonists had also learned how to hunt and
fish to survive� As a result, they had produced more than
enough food to get them through the next winter� They
had also been able to build homes that would protect
them from the cold weather when it came again� While
they mourned the loss of so many, the surviving colonists
were thankful for what they now had� That is why they
decided to give thanks to God for the Native people who
had helped them�


_An abundant harvest_


116 117


 - Ask, “Why did the Pilgrims decide to give thanks to God for the Native people?”


» They gave him thanks for the people who helped them learn how to grow crops in

the poor soil of the region, where to hunt and fish, and helped them build homes

that would protect them from the coming winter.

 - Tell students to use information and specific details from the chapter to

 - Help students look back through the chapter to find sentences that support

their predictions.


 - Draw the two groups together again and use the following questions to

promote a discussion.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READING (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Why do you think Squanto and Samoset had decided to help

the struggling Pilgrims?


» Answers may vary but could include that Squanto and Samoset had
experienced the loss of many of their own people and felt sorry for the
Pilgrims or that they spoke English so they could communicate with the
Pilgrims. Squanto had been to England with an English explorer in 1605 and
perhaps developed a friendship with the English during that visit.


2. **Evaluative.** Do you think the Pilgrims would have survived if Squanto and

Samoset had not helped?


» Answers may vary but could include that the Pilgrims might not have survived
because they were not aware of foods that grew in North America but were
not safe to eat. They may not have been able to grow crops in the poor soil
because they did not know how to make plants grow in it. They may not have
known the best places to fish. The Pilgrims might have survived by figuring
out how to solve these problems on their own.

   - After that I never forgot to feed my cat. (Students may comment that this

ending ties up the story and predicts how the character is going to act in

the future.)


   - “That’s something to look forward to,” Tom thought to himself. He knew,

however, that between now and then there would be many more days

of working in the hot sun. (Students may comment that this ending

describes the character’s feelings at the end of the story.)


   - So there you go! Is Domino the best cat in the world? That’s why I call him

Super Domino! (Students may comment that this ending describes the

character’s feelings about their pet at the end of the story.)

)



**Comparative and Superlative Adverbs**
**(Digital Projection DP.U9.L7.1)**


**Comparative and Superlative Adverbs**


**Comparative adverbs** compare two actions to show that one is greater

or more. The suffix – _er_ is added to adverbs.


**Superlative adverbs** compare more than two actions to show that one is

greatest or most. The suffix – _est_ is added to adverbs.


Instead of the suffixes – _er_ and – _est_, use the words _more_ and _most_

when forming comparative and superlative adverbs that end with the

suffixes – _ly_ or that have three or more syllables.




- Remind students that adverbs can be used to compare actions by adding

suffixes or using the words _more_ or _most_ .


- Remind students that the word _more_ is added to adverbs to make them

comparative and the word _most_ is added to adverbs to make them superlative.


- Have students turn to a partner and discuss “What is the difference between

comparative and superlative adverbs?” Encourage them to present an

example. Be prepared to provide corrective feedback when necessary.


» Comparative adverbs compare only two actions, while superlative adverbs

compare more than two actions.


- Have students take out Activity Page 8.3.


- Tell students you will read a sentence twice. The second time you read it, hum

when the word _more_ or the word _most_ needs to be added. Students should

just listen the first time you read it.


- Read the following sentences, humming when you reach the blank on the

second time so students write the correct word in the blank using their best

cursive handwriting.


1. We will probably arrive by 2:00 than 3:00. (more)

a New England colony.


~~**TEKS 3.1.A; TEKS 3.3.B; TEKS 3.6.G; TEKS 3.6.F**~~


~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that today they will continue to learn about the first Thanksgiving

and the Pilgrims. However, today’s Read-Aloud focuses on a specific speech

that Governor William Bradford made at the first Thanksgiving. This speech

references several passages from the Christian Bible in the book of Psalms,

specifically Psalm 107.


 - Tell students that the book of Psalms is a collection of 150 psalms (songs/

poems/hymns) that are used in both Jewish and Christian worship. Many were

written by King David, an Israelite king (who famously killed the giant Goliath).

Psalm 107, where our text comes from, is a song of thanksgiving.


 - To activate background knowledge, ask students the following questions:


    - What do you remember about the Pilgrims and their pilgrimage to North

America?


» Answers may vary but should include that the Pilgrims came to North America on

the Mayflower in 1620. They had a difficult journey across the Atlantic Ocean, but

they eventually landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts.


    - Who helped the Pilgrims during their first spring in North America? How

did this person/these people help them?


» Squanto, Samoset, and the Wampanoag tribe helped the Pilgrims. They taught the

Pilgrims where to hunt and fish, and which local plants were good to eat. They also

taught the Pilgrims how to grow crops in the New England soil.

In the last lesson, you read about the

Pilgrims’ arrival at Plymouth Rock,

their struggle to survive their first

year in America, and the help they

received from the Native people.

Squanto, his friend Samoset, and the Wampanoag (/Wamp*ah*nog/)

tribe were all **instrumental**, or very important, in helping the Pilgrims

survive. Another person who was key to the success of the colonists

was their governor, William Bradford.

You might remember from Lesson

7 that William Bradford was one of

the original colonists who came over

on the _Mayflower_ and signed the

Mayflower Compact. The Mayflower

Compact outlined what the first

government in America should look

like. The colonists decided that they

would remain loyal to King James of

England, but they would make laws

for the good of the colony and follow

those laws. William Bradford was elected governor of Plymouth in

1621 and held the position for thirty years! Much of what we know

about daily Pilgrim life during this time comes from the journal he

If students have trouble
recalling information about
William Bradford, remind
them that he is the person
who persuaded the Virginia
Company to let the Pilgrims
make their trip on the
_Mayflower_ and convinced
the company to give them
land to settle on when they
arrived in America. You may
also wish to remind them
that he was one of the main
writers of the Mayflower
Compact.

Tell students that
_instrumental_ has multiple
meanings. They may be
familiar with the definition
of _instrumental_ that means

more like a king or a president? Why?


**Show Image U9.L9.3:**
**The first Thanksgiving**


Following the success of that first

harvest, Governor William Bradford

organized a feast to celebrate and give

thanks to God for all his **blessings** .

~~_Do you remember what this feast_~~

~~_was called?_~~ At the first Thanksgiving, the Pilgrims and their friends

from the Wampanoag tribe met to share a meal. Before they ate,

William Bradford said a prayer, which became an important part of the

Thanksgiving feast. His prayer was a song found in the Christian Bible

in the book of Psalms. The Pilgrims, and many early colonists, were

very familiar with the book of Psalms, which is composed of over one

hundred and fifty songs and poems. Bradford read from Psalm 107.

It begins, “Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love endures

forever.”


- Read-Aloud Pause: Why do you think William Bradford wanted to read a song

of thanks?


Unit 9 Colonial America

~~**ELPS 4.F**~~


**Show Image U9.L9.4:**
**Ships on Rough Water**


Bradford’s first prayer to establish

the Thanksgiving tradition recognized

the struggle of the early colonists and

has been used in many Thanksgiving

celebrations since then as a reminder of those struggles. Think about

the Pilgrims’ decision to leave their homes and travel across the Atlantic

Ocean to reach a totally unknown land. When they reached Plymouth,

they had to build their colony from the ground up. There were no houses

or stores. That was hard work! Another part of the Psalm that Bradford

read says, “Those He gathered from the lands, from east and west, from

north and south. Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way

to a city where they could settle. They were hungry and thirsty, and their

lives **ebbed** away. Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and He

delivered them from their **distress.** ” [1]


 - Read-Aloud Pause: What do you think William Bradford was thinking about

when he read this part of the prayer? Why would the Pilgrims feel distress?


**Show Image U9.L9.5:**
**A Safe Haven**


Another part of Bradford’s prayer from

the Psalm was, “Some went out on the

sea in ships; they were merchants on

the mighty waters. They saw the works

of the Lord, His wonderful deeds in the

deep. For He spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.

They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their

peril their courage melted away . . . Then they cried out to the Lord in

their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress. He stilled the

storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed. They were glad

when it grew calm, and He guided them to their desired **haven.** ” [2]


**1.** Psalm 107: 3–6
**2.** Psalm 107: 23–26, 28–31

a list of things they are
thankful for.

means to be very anxious or
sad.

**218**




- Read-Aloud Pause: Why do you think William Bradford shared these examples

with the Pilgrims?


**Show Image U9.L9.6: Bountiful Land**


Think about all that the Pilgrims

endured at Plymouth. Toward the end of

Bradford’s prayer, the Psalm said: “There

he brought the hungry to live, and they

founded a city where they could settle.

They **sowed** fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;

He blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and He did not

let their herds diminish.” This part of his prayer describes how people

were able to settle in a new place and live productive and happy lives.


- Read-Aloud Pause: What connections can you make between the Pilgrims and

this part of the psalm?


**Show Image U9.L9.7: President Lincoln**
**giving Thanksgiving Day proclamation**


Following the success of the first harvest

feast, the **tradition** was repeated each

year. Over two hundred years later,

in 1863, President Lincoln declared

Thanksgiving a national holiday. His

**proclamation** said, “I do, therefore, invite

my fellow-citizens in every part of the

United States . . . to set apart and observe

the last Thursday of November next as a

Day of Thanksgiving.” This proclamation,

or official announcement, was continued

by many presidents after Lincoln. When President Ronald Reagan made a

Thanksgiving Day proclamation in 1985, he even reminded everyone that

Governor William Bradford was responsible for the first Thanksgiving Day

celebration.


Unit 9 Colonial America


**Show Image U9.L9.8: Harry Truman**
**pardoning a turkey**


Every year on Thanksgiving, the

president of the United States holds

a ceremony at the White House. The

president reads the Thanksgiving Day

proclamation to remind citizens of the meaning and purpose of the

holiday. The ceremony ends with the annual Thanksgiving turkey

**pardon** . A pardon is when you forgive someone for an offense, and they

will no longer face consequences. The president chooses a big turkey,

pardons it, and promises the turkey it will not end up as Thanksgiving

dinner! The first president to pardon a turkey was President Harry

Truman in 1947. This is a fun tradition that all ages enjoy.


 - Read-Aloud Pause: How is Thanksgiving today different from the first

Thanksgiving celebration?


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Who were the two groups of people who celebrated together at the

first Thanksgiving?


» the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe


2. **Inferential.** Why was giving thanks so important to William Bradford and

the Pilgrims?


» Answers may vary but could include that their faith was important to them and

giving thanks was a way to honor God as they believed.


3. **Evaluative.** William Bradford wrote about daily life for the Pilgrims in his

journal, Of _Plimoth Plantation_ . Why would historians, or people who study

history, want to read this journal? What might it help them understand?


» Answers may vary but should include something about the journal being a

firsthand account, or primary source, of what life was like for the Pilgrims when

they first arrived in North America. Without it, we would not have as much

information or understanding about this time period.


4. **Inferential.** Why do you think the Pilgrims continued to celebrate

Thanksgiving year after year?


» Answers may vary but could include that they wanted to continue giving thanks to

God as they believed and to remember all that they had been through.

~~**WORD WORK: TRADITION (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _tradition_ on the board in cursive to give students an

opportunity to practice decoding the word before discussion. Review syllable

division patterns at this time as well.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard, “Following the success of the first harvest

feast, the _tradition_ was repeated each year.”


3. Say the word _tradition_ with me.


_4. Tradition_ means a custom passed down from generation to generation.

Traditions can be related to stories, foods, clothing, jewelry, etc. You can have

traditions with your family or your friends.


5. One tradition many families share is having turkey at Thanksgiving.


6. Listen to the sentence from the Read-Aloud again: “Following the success of

the first harvest feast, the _tradition_ was repeated each year.” What word(s) in

that sentence could help us understand the meaning of _tradition? (repeated_

_each year)_


7. Do you have any traditions? Has your family ever started any traditions?

Be sure to use the word tradition when you tell about it. (Ask two or three

students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make

complete sentences: “One tradition we have is . . .”).

~~**TEKS 3.11.D.iv**~~



Students will revise a draft of a narrative using a revision checklist.


~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.11.C**~~


~~**ADDING COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE ADJECTIVES (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Prepare to project DP.U9.L2.2 (Comparative and Superlative Adjectives chart)

or show the previously prepared chart paper.


**Comparative and Superlative Adjectives**


**Comparative adjectives** compare two nouns to show that one is greater

or more. The suffix _–er_ is added to adjectives.

**Superlative adjectives** compare more than two nouns to show that one is

greatest or most. The suffix _–est_ is added to adjectives.

Instead of the suffixes _–er_ and _–est_, use the words more and most when

forming comparative and superlative adjectives that end with the suffixes

_–ful, –less, –ing, –ed, –ous_ or that have three or more syllables.

 - Review comparative and superlative adjectives with students and tell

them that today they are going to reread their drafts and add one or two

comparative or superlative adjectives into their stories.


 - Tell students that as they revise their sentences to include comparative or

superlative adjectives, they should reread the sentences before and after to

ensure everything still makes sense and flows together.


 - As students work, circulate to provide support and answer questions.


 - As students finish, pair them up and have them read each other’s drafts. Have

students provide any feedback they feel is necessary.


**TEKS 3.11.D.iv** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including: adjectives, including their comparative and
superlative forms; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces
between words; **TEKS 3.11.C** Revise drafts to improve sentence structure and word choice by adding, deleting, combining,

**READ-ALOUD: "RELIGIOUS DISSENT AND**
~~**THE NEW ENGLAND COLONIES" (20 MIN.)**~~









**Student Reader Pages 132—133**
John Winthrop addressing the Puritans


The Pilgrims had solved some of their

problems, but the Puritans had not.

In England, the Puritans were still

struggling to worship the way they



wanted to. They wanted to change and purify the Church of England.

When the Puritans heard about the Pilgrims’ colony at Plymouth,

they decided that they should try to do a similar thing. They came up

with a plan to do just that.


- On Activity Page 10.1, direct the students to the first box on the page: Compare

or Contrast? Ask students to determine if the paragraph read aloud compared

or contrasted the Puritans and the Pilgrims. (contrast) Ask: What was different

about the two groups? (The Puritans wanted to stay with the church and have

a way of life based on the Christian Bible; the Pilgrims wanted to separate from

the church.)


In 1628, a number of Puritans, led by a man named John Winthrop,

decided that they would establish a colony in New England to the north of

Plymouth. The Puritans realized that they would have to be very organized.

They had heard about the hardships faced by those who had already gone

to the colonies. They knew that many had died due to lack of food and

shelter. The Puritans were determined to avoid these mistakes.


~~What kinds of hardships did the earliest colonists face?~~ ~~_(lack of_~~

~~_food, shelter, harsh weather, disease, etc.)_~~ ~~What does it mean to be~~

~~determined? (~~ ~~_to reach a decision_~~ ~~)~~


It was decided that a small group of Puritans would go ahead of the

others and begin to build a colony. Then, in 1629, a group of English

Puritans and merchants formed the Massachusetts Bay Company.



Support


Explain that _hardship_
means something that
causes pain or suffering.



Lesson 10 Pilgrims and Puritans
**231**


The aim of the company was to make money for the Puritan colony

by trading furs, as well as by fishing and shipbuilding. ( _There would be_

_some farming, too, but the settlers knew that the rocky New England_

_soil would never support a large farming economy_ .)


The company itself would be run according to Puritan principles, or

rules. It was also decided that this Puritan colony would be different

from other English colonies. In order to live in this colony, people would

have to live according to the how the leaders of the colony interpreted

the Christian Bible and their belief of Christian principles.



**Student Reader Pages 134–135**
Ship laden with supplies
Puritan town


John Winthrop believed that their

**colony** should be an example to

others in terms of how people should









**232**



live. He once said, “For we . . . shall be as a City upon a hill; the eyes of

all people are on us.”


~~What did Winthrop mean when he compared the colony to a city on a~~

~~hill?~~ ~~_(that it would be a good example of successful Puritan life_~~ ~~)~~


- On Activity Page 10.1, direct the student to the second box on the page:

Compare or Contrast? Ask students to determine if the paragraphs read

aloud compared or contrasted the Puritans and the Pilgrims. (contrast) Ask:

“What was different about the two groups?” (the Puritans were planning to

be more organized than the Pilgrims; they planned to trade furs, fish, and

build ships instead of relying on farming for their economy; they formed the

Massachusetts Bay Company that would be run according to Puritan rules,

according to how they interpreted the Christian Bible and their belief of

Christian principles.)


Finally, in 1630, John Winthrop set sail for New England with three ships

and about seven hundred colonists. They brought a good amount of


Unit 9 Colonial America


food with them, as well as cows, horses, and tools. They were more

prepared than any of the other English settlers so far. When they

arrived, there were already some small buildings in place from the

settlement of the first party they had sent. This settlement was called

Salem. Other settlements were established in Charlestown, Cambridge,

and Boston. This Puritan **colony** was named the Massachusetts Bay

**Colony**, and John Winthrop would become its governor.


As planned, the Massachusetts Bay **Colony** was different from the

colonies developing in the South. The careful laws that had been

drawn up in England were put in place in the **colony**, and people

had to follow them. For example, everyone had to go to church.

Those involved in the government of the colony were **senior** church

members, and only male church members could elect their leaders.

As you have heard, whereas the Pilgrims were happy to separate

from the Church of England, the Puritans wanted to remain a part of

it and were determined to change it. They hoped that by their precise

example of **pure** living, the Church of England would change religious

rules that the Puritans disagreed with.


The Massachusetts Bay **Colony** was very successful and grew quite

rapidly. Each Puritan town was carefully planned, with each family

being given enough land on which to build a home and farm. The

most important building in the town was the meetinghouse. This was

where religious services and town meetings were held. Puritans also

believed in the power of education. They wanted their children to be

able to read so they could read the Christian Bible.









**Student Reader Pages 136—137**
Roger Williams statue and Roger Williams


In 1631, Roger Williams, a minister

from London, arrived in the

Massachusetts Bay **Colony** in

Boston. Almost from the beginning,



Williams did not agree with some of the leaders. He believed that the


Lesson 10 Pilgrims and Puritans
**233**


leaders of the **colony** had too much control over people’s lives. He

especially disliked the close connection between the church and the

government. Williams felt that what was happening was too much

like the English system they had tried to escape. The leaders of the

Massachusetts Bay **Colony** felt **threatened** by his views.


As more and more people came to the colony, Williams saw more and

more land being taken from Native Americans. He strongly believed that

Native Americans should be paid for this land. Before long, the leaders

of the Massachusetts Bay **Colony** considered him to be a troublemaker.

Roger Williams was labeled a religious **dissenter** and was forced to leave

the colony. There were some who wanted to send him back to England!


~~What is a dissenter?~~ ~~_(A dissenter is someone who disagrees with the_~~

~~_majority, which is usually a government or church.)_~~


Before they could send him back, however, in 1636, Roger Williams left

the **colony** in the middle of the night in the dead of winter. A few of his

supporters left with him. It was **bitterly** cold, and he and his followers

had nowhere to go. With the help of some Native Americans, they

survived in the woods for three months. Eventually, Williams made his

way south to what would become Providence, Rhode Island. There he

purchased land from the Narragansett, a local Native American **tribe** .

This area became the **colony** of Rhode Island.







**Student Reader Pages 138—139**
Anne Hutchinson


Gradually, others who also found it

difficult to follow the Puritan way of

life followed Williams. Rhode Island

became a haven for people who





**234**



own way. Rhode Island became the first English **colony** to allow

people complete religious freedom and welcome not only Puritans,

but Quakers, Roman Catholics, Jews, and others, too.


Unit 9 Colonial America


- On Activity Page 10.1, direct the student to the third box on the page: Compare

or Contrast? Ask students to determine if the paragraphs read aloud

compared or contrasted the Puritans and the Pilgrims. (contrast) Ask: “What

was different about the two groups?” (the Puritans were more prepared than

any previous colonists)


Another Puritan who followed Roger Williams was a woman named

Anne Hutchinson. She and her husband and children had arrived in the

Massachusetts Bay **Colony** in 1634. As you have heard, women were not

part of the decision-making process in the church, or in **society** in general.

Women certainly weren’t allowed to **preach,** or deliver a religious speech

or message, in church. Because of these restrictions, Anne Hutchinson

organized weekly meetings in her home for women who wanted to discuss

these sermons, or religious speeches. In these meetings, women also

were free to discuss their religious views. These meetings became so

popular that men, and even some of the church leaders, began to attend.


Hutchinson openly expressed her view that a person’s individual faith

was more important than being a member of an organized church.

She also said that a person’s personal relationship with God was the

only thing that really mattered. This was considered by many to be

a very dangerous view because the Puritan church had rules that

were required to be followed. On top of this, Anne Hutchinson was

a woman. So, just like Roger Williams, Hutchinson was put on trial

for being a **dissenter** . During the trial, Hutchinson was ordered to

recant, or take back, her beliefs and say she changed her mind, but

she refused. Like Roger Williams, she, too, was banished.


~~Why were Anne Hutchinson’s beliefs about religion considered~~

~~“dangerous”? (~~ ~~_Puritans believed that the rules of their church needed_~~

~~_to be followed exactly._~~ ~~)~~


In 1638, Anne Hutchinson joined Roger Williams in Rhode Island.

After her husband died, she moved to New York with her younger

children to start a new life. At the time, New York was called New

Netherlands and was a Dutch **colony** . The governor there did not

have a good reputation with Native Americans and had caused many

disputes between the Native people and the colonists. He had also

created **tension** among various groups of Native Americans.


- On Activity Page 10.1, direct the student to the fourth box on the page:

Compare or Contrast? Ask students to determine if the paragraphs read aloud

compared or contrasted the Puritans and the Pilgrims. (compare) Ask: “What

was the same about the two groups?” (Women were not allowed in decision
making or allowed to preach in society in general.)


**Student Reader Pages 140—141**
Thomas Hooker with settlers in Connecticut



In 1636, a Puritan minister by the name of

Thomas Hooker also left the Massachusetts

Bay **Colony** with a group of supporters.

They made their way to an area that is

now Connecticut and founded the town of

Hartford near a wide river now known as the









**236**



Connecticut River. Soon, two more settlements, Windsor and Wethersfield,

were established in the **colony** of Connecticut.


One of the things that Thomas Hooker believed was that all men should

be allowed to vote, not just those who were members of a church

or those who were wealthy. In 1639, Thomas Hooker implemented a

system of government in Connecticut called the Fundamental Orders of

Connecticut. It was a form of democracy that later helped to inspire the

**creation** of the U.S. Constitution.


~~What is a democracy?~~ ~~_(a form of government in which people have a say_~~

~~_in the government)_~~


We’ve just talked about the **creation** of three of the four New England

colonies. The last New England **colony** is New Hampshire. You might be

surprised to hear that King James I helped to establish New Hampshire,

too! Remember how he "gave" an area of other land he had claimed to

his friends? Well, he "gave" this part of North America to two more of


Unit 9 Colonial America


his friends—John Mason and Ferdinando Gorges. ~~Note to students that~~

~~_gave_~~ ~~is in quotation marks, since Native Americans already inhabited~~

~~this land.~~ Later, the two men divided the land in half, and Mason got the

southern part that became the New Hampshire **colony** in 1679. Many

unhappy Puritan settlers also found their way to this colony. Gorges

received the northern half that would later become the state of Maine.



As you can see, back in the seventeenth



century, many English people



were willing to risk their lives to sail to a faraway land in the hope of a

better life. Do you think you would have been willing to do the same?


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** Give examples of how the Puritans were more prepared than

other English colonists who had come before them.


» Answers will vary, but may include that they brought plenty of food, cows, horses,

and tools; they already had buildings built by the small part that came ahead; they

knew about the rocky soil and cold winters; etc.)


2. **Inferential.** Which Puritan laws were the most important ones

to follow?


» Everyone had to go to church; only church members could elect leaders; senior

members of the church were the leaders in government.

and never return.


6. Have you ever heard of someone being called a dissenter? What are some

things that made that person a dissenter? Is being a dissenter a bad thing?

Why or why not? Try to use the word _dissenter_ when you tell about it. (Ask

two or three students. If necessary, guide and/ or rephrase the students’

responses to make complete sentences: “ was a dissenter because . .

. ”

or “Being a dissenter can be good/bad because. . . .”)

We came here from England in the year 1630� I was

the Pilgrims, we did not want to break away from the
Church of England� We wanted the church to be **purer**

King Charles I would listen to our requests for change�
In the end, we had no choice but to leave our homes and
start a new life somewhere else�


We chose to create our own Puritan **colony** on land
north of the Pilgrim **colony** of Plymouth� Guided by our
leader John Winthrop, we sent men ahead to prepare the
way for us� They began the construction of houses in an
area we call Salem� They cleared the land for planting�
We now have four settlements within our **colony**    Apart from Salem, we have Boston, Charlestown,
and Cambridge� The population within our **colony** is
growing rapidly� Each year, hundreds of people come to
live their lives with us� I have heard the grownups say
that even King Charles I cannot believe how successful
and strong we are becoming�

students answer.


» Answers may vary but could include that trade ships frequently moved in and out

of the harbors, bringing guns, tools, cloth, and news about life in England.

Lesson 10 Pilgrims and Puritans
**243**


**244**



Trade ships frequently move in and out of our
**harbors** . I love to watch the men unload items that have
been sent across the ocean. We need guns, tools, and
cloth. We hear news from home by talking to the sailors
and newly arrived colonists. It makes our hearts flutter
when the sailors and passengers talk of life in England.
Just two months ago, I sat on the snow-covered dock and
listened to stories from home. The sailors spoke of the
**glorious** sound of the London church bells ringing out
on Christmas Day. They also reminded us of the smell of
roasting pheasant and sweet plum pudding. As you can
tell, some of us are sometimes homesick but we know
our cause is just and good and worth the **sacrifice** .


People are welcome here, but all who come to live
with us must live according to how we interpret the rules
of the Christian Bible. That is the Puritan way. Thus,
I must surely **mend my ways** . I must not smile during
Elder Jones’s sermon, no matter how long it is. I can tell
you, Elder Jones does like to do a lot of **preaching** .

**Poetry Reading**


 - Tell students that they are going to hear a poem titled “Landing of the Pilgrim

Fathers” written by Felicia Hemans.


 - Tell students that Felicia Hemans lived from 1793-1835 and wrote historical

poems including this one.


 - Tell students to listen for describing words, or adjectives, as you read the

poem aloud. How does the poet describe the land that the Pilgrims have

discovered? How do the Pilgrims feel upon reaching land? ~~**[ TEKS 3.10.D ]**~~


 - Tell students you are going to slowly re-read the poem aloud. Ask students to

write down any rhyming words they hear. How many pairs of rhyming words

can they list? Do the poem’s rhyming words have a pattern? ~~**TEKS 3.9.B**~~


**Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers**


**By Felicia Hemans**


The breaking waves dashed high

On a stern and rock-bound coast,

And the woods against a stormy sky

Their giant branches tossed;


And the heavy night hung dark,

The hills and waters o’er,

When a band of exiles moored their bark

On the wild New England shore.


Not as the conqueror comes,

They, the true-hearted came;

Not with the roll of the stirring drums,

And the trumpet that sings of fame;


Not as the flying come,

In silence and in fear;


**TEKS 3.10.D** Describe how the author’s use of imagery, literal and figurative language such as simile, and sound devices such
as onomatopoeia achieves specific purposes; **TEKS 3.9.B** Explain rhyme scheme, sound devices, and structural elements
such as stanzas in a variety of poems.


Unit 9 Colonial America


They shook the depths of the desert gloom

With their hymns of lofty cheer.


Amidst the storm they sang,

And the stars heard, and the sea;

And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang

To the anthem of the free.


The ocean eagle soared

From his nest by the white wave’s foam;

And the rocking pines of the forest roared-
This was their welcome home.


There were men with hoary hair

Amidst the pilgrim band:

Why had they come to wither there,

Away from their childhood’s land?


There was woman’s fearless eye,

Lit by her deep love’s truth;

There was manhood’s brow, serenely high,

And the fiery heart of youth.


What sought they thus afar?

Bright jewels of the mine?

The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?

They sought a faith’s pure shrine!


Ay, call it holy ground,

The soil where first they trod;

They have left unstained what there they found -
Freedom to worship God.


 - After reading the poem, ask students to share a characteristic of the land or

weather that they heard in the poem. Ask them to remember the describing

words, or adjectives, that Felicia Hemans used to create an image of the

landing.


 - Ask students to identify and share what they notice about the rhyme scheme

(ABAB) and the stanzas (10 stanzas, 4 lines per stanza) in this poem. ~~**TEKS 3.9.B**~~


 - Reread the poem and ask students to think about how the poem’s imagery

this contrasts with the joy the pilgrims felt in reaching land and being free. As

time permits, you may wish to have students create drawings depicting the

event described in the poem. Have them share their drawings and discuss how

surviving difficult weather and terrain made this event even more joyous for

the Pilgrims. ~~**[ TEKS 3.8.D ]**~~


**Poetry Writing**


 - Using the poem “Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers” as a model, have students

create their own poems about the Pilgrims’ voyage.


**Multiple-Meaning Word Activity: Seasoned**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard; images depicting the

various meanings of the word season


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Some of the men were well-known, daring

adventurers. Others were seasoned sailors.” Here _seasoned_ is an adjective

that means “experienced.” The sailors who were seasoned had many years

of experience sailing on ships because they had been through many seasons

doing so. They knew better than the daring adventurers what to expect at

sea. [Write “A—experienced” on the board.]


2. Who can tell me what the noun _season_ means? (time of year; winter, spring,

summer, fall or autumn) This is the second meaning of the word _season_,

such as in this sentence: “My favorite season is fall because of the colorful

leaves.” [Write “B—time of year” on the board.] Ask students what the

differences are between the two words. (the _–ed_ suffix, or ending; the part of

speech) Remind students that the noun _season_ may also be plural, as in this

sentence: “We experience four seasons in New England.”


3. Another meaning of the word _season_ is to add flavor to food, such as when

you sprinkle salt or pepper on some of your dinner. Who can tell me what

part of speech _season_ is in the following example: “My dad likes to season

fish with lemon and garlic.” (verb) This verb can also have these forms:

_seasons_, _seasoned_, and _seasoning_ . Another example is “My sister is always

over-seasoning her food with tons of salt!” [Write “C—to flavor food” on the

board.]


4. I am going to read some sentences. After I finish each sentence, tell me if

the word _season_ has meaning A, B, or C. Use the key words on the board to

explain why. • In the season we call summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it

gets very hot outside. (B—time of year) • Darcy was a seasoned swimmer


**TEKS 3.8.D** Explain the influence of the setting on the plot.


Unit 9 Colonial America


after being on the swim team for five years. (A—experienced) • The soup

needed to be seasoned with some onion and celery. (C—to flavor food)


5. With your neighbor, take turns coming up with sentences that include the

word _season_ . You may also use the other forms you have heard: _seasons_,

_seasoned_, and _seasoning_ . For example your neighbor might say, “Winter is

my favorite season.” And you would respond, “Winter is a time of the year.

The word _season_ has meaning B.” I will call on some of you to share your

sentences. [You may wish to have some students also identify the part

of speech.]


6. [You may wish to show students images depicting the various meanings of

the word _season_ .]


**Riddles for Core Content**


Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content. Students

will answer follow-up questions after mastering the riddle in order to

practice other skills learned throughout the unit (including: synthesizing,

comparing/contrasting, supporting claims with text evidence, inferencing

and evaluating).


 - I am the location known as the “Lost Colony,” where the English settlers tried

to establish the first colony in North America, although both attempts failed.

What am I? (Roanoke Island) Why was I known as the “Lost Colony”? (When

the explorers returned to Roanoke Island, the soldiers they had left behind to

guard their fort had disappeared.)


 - We are two Englishmen who attempted to settle on Roanoke Island. Who are

we? (Sir Walter Raleigh and John White) Compare us: how are we similar and/

or different? (Answers may vary.)


 - We are the two colonial regions that each have unique geography, climate,

industries, and cultures. What are we? (New England and Southern) How would

you describe what is unique about each of us? You can use your Reader to help

you answer this question. (Answers may vary.)


 - We are the three ships on which the English sailed to America to start the first

permanent English colony. What are we? (the _Discovery_, _Susan Constant_, and

_Godspeed_ ) Which one of us means “Good Luck”? ( _Godspeed_ ) How do you

think we got our names? (Answers may vary.)


 - I am the king who chartered the colony of Jamestown. Who am I?

(King James I) What do you know about me? You can use your Reader to help

you. (Answers may vary.)

- We are the Native American chiefdom that was living in the area the English

called Jamestown. Who are we? (the Powhatan)


- I didn’t beat around the bush, but instead came up with a plan to help save

Jamestown. Who am I? (John Smith) Why did Jamestown need saving?

(Settlers were starving because they were unable to survive on their

own.) Did I save Jamestown on my own? If not, who helped me? (No—the

Powhatan people, including Chief Powhatan and Pocahontas, helped save the

settlers in Jamestown by providing them with food and teaching them how to

hunt/grow crops.)


- My passage to North America was paid for by someone else, and now I must

work for them for seven years. What am I? (an indentured servant) Why did

colonists in the Americas want to use people like me? (Answers will vary.)


- We are the three cash crops grown in the Southern colonies. What are

we? (rice, tobacco, indigo) How were cash crops connected to the use of

indentured servitude and eventually enslavement? (Settlers learned they

could make lots of money off of cash crops, but they needed lots manual labor

to grow and manage the crops.)


**Venn Diagram**


Materials: Activity Page PP.1; chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


- Tell students that together you are going to compare and contrast two things

or people they have learned about during the Colonial America unit by asking

how they are similar and how they are different.


   - Copy onto chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard the Venn diagram

from Activity Page PP.1. List two things at the top of the diagram, and then

capture information provided by students. Choose from the following list,

or create a pair of your own:


   - the Southern and New England regions


   - Roanoke and Jamestown


   - Virginia and the Carolinas


   - Maryland and Georgia


   - indentured servants and enslaved laborers


   - tobacco and indigo


   - Pilgrims and Puritans


Unit 9 Colonial America


    - the birth of Virginia Dare and the first Thanksgiving


    - Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson


    - the Powhatan and the Wampanoag


 - You may wish to prepare several copies of the Venn diagram to compare

and contrast several things. You may also wish to have students use these

diagrams as brainstorming information for further writing.


 - You may wish to have some students use Activity Page PP.1 to complete this

activity independently. You may also wish to have some students create a

three-way Venn diagram to compare and contrast three people or items, such

as three colonies or three colonists learned about thus far.


**Class Book: Colonial America**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools


 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book

to help them remember what they have learned thus far in this unit. Have

students brainstorm important information about the regions and colonies

they have studied thus far. Have each student choose one idea to draw a

picture of, and ask them to write a caption for the picture. Bind the pages to

make a book to put in the class library for students to read again and again.

You may choose to add more pages upon completion of the entire unit before

binding the book.


~~**WRITING PROMPTS**~~


Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


 - The most interesting thing I’ve learned thus far is because . . .


 - If I could choose to live in one of the Southern or New England colonies,

I would choose because . . .


 - The saying “beat around the bush” relates to John Smith and the Jamestown

colony because . . .


 - Some of the challenges the English settlers faced in the colonies were . . .

**Researching the Colonies**


Materials: Locally approved sources; trade books or other resources


- Have students complete research about the 13 colonies to expand upon

what they have heard in this unit. You may wish to specifically focus upon

the colonies which do not receive as much of an emphasis, such as North

Carolina, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Delaware. You may

also wish to have students research a colony which they would like to know

more about. Finally, you may wish to have students research information

about the present-day states of Maine and Vermont, and how these two

areas took a different path to statehood. Have students add to their Thirteen

Colonies graphic organizers, or write a separate paragraph in their Colonial

America notebook or folder. Ensure all research is monitored by the teacher.


**Classroom Compact**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard; parchment

paper (optional)


- Ask for a volunteer to describe the Mayflower Compact. After students have

shared, tell them that they are now going to make a “Classroom Compact”

together. Divide students into three groups. Each group will select a scribe to

write down what the group agrees are the two most important rules the class

needs to be able to get along with one another. (Take five minutes.)


- Once each group has its two rules written down, gather all students together

again, and have a speaker (not the scribe) from each group share the rules

with everyone. If there are repeated rules, point out that they have already

started in the spirit of agreement, similar to the Pilgrims and others on

the _Mayflower_ .


- Once the class has decided upon the necessary rules, write out the

“Classroom Compact” on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard. You may

also wish to write it on parchment paper, or have each student copy the rules

individually onto parchment paper and then roll up the document into a scroll.


**Colony Travel Brochure**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools


- Have students choose a colony and write a travel brochure to describe it. Have

students include information about the geography, climate, foliage, activities,

industries, sights to see, etc. Encourage students to be as descriptive as

possible, and to remember that the purpose of a travel brochure is to entice

visitors to come experience a place for themselves. Have students add a

descriptive illustration to their brochure.


Unit 9 Colonial America


**Re-Reading and Retelling the Read-Aloud**


Materials: Index cards


 - Reread excerpts from the Read-Aloud “Religious Dissent and the New England

Colonies.” Have students retell the Read-Aloud from the point of view of three

key people: John Winthrop, Roger Williams, and Anne Hutchinson. Remind

students of the 5 finger re-tell method introduced in the beginning of the unit.

Place students in three groups to discuss the following about each key person:


    - Why did this person come to the “colonies”?


    - To which colony did they go?


    - What happened in their life?


    - What contributions did they make?


    - What other facts do you know about them?


 - After discussion, have each student in the group write one different clue about

their key person on an index card, and then write the name of the key person

lightly on the bottom of the card. Collect and shuffle the cards. Then one at a

time, draw a card and read the clue to the class. You may wish to keep score

for each group as they guess the key person according to the clues. You may

wish to complete this exercise with other Read-Alouds.


**Additional Editing Practice: Capitalization of Holidays**


 - Warm-Up: Ask students to edit a sentence. Pose this prompt: What change

needs to be made in this sentence? Write the corrected sentence and then

share out.


    - _We went to my aunt’s house for thanksgiving day._


 - Remind students that in Lesson 9 they read that President Abraham Lincoln

declared Thanksgiving Day a national holiday. As students edit their narratives,

hold students accountable for capitalizing holidays.


 - Explain that holiday names are capitalized because they are proper nouns.

This rule applies to all holidays. If there is more than one word in a holiday

name, all of the words are capitalized.


 - If students have included a holiday in their narratives, have them review and

edit to ensure they have capitalized the holiday correctly. This can also be

done as a peer editing activity.


 - Use Activity Page 17.3 to have students practice editing for capitalization of all

proper nouns, including holidays.

Map of Henry Hudson’s route/
Henry Hudson


The English had now successfully

established a number of colonies in

North America. They were determined













**264**



to claim more land, which is why in 1664 a fleet of English warships

sailed into New Amsterdam **Harbor**, which is now New York **Harbor** in

New York City. England promptly claimed the **harbor** as its own. While

they were at it, the English claimed the city and all the land around

it, too. This was particularly bold because, not only were these areas

already Dutch colonies, but Native Americans were living there as well.

How and why did this happen? Let’s go back in time to find out.


~~Explain that the area was named after the capital city of Amsterdam~~

~~in the Netherlands. The adjective~~ ~~_Dutch_~~ ~~is used to refer to the people~~

~~from the Netherlands.~~


Unit 9 Colonial America


In 1609, Henry Hudson, an Englishman exploring for the Netherlands,

set sail across the Atlantic Ocean on behalf of the Dutch East India

Company. His destination was North America. Hudson, like many

other explorers of the time, was searching for a northwestern water

route to Asia, or what they called the Northwest Passage.


Although Hudson did not find that route, he did find an area that

is now part of the greater New York City area. When he arrived in

this **harbor**, Hudson claimed it for the Netherlands. The **harbor**

area was named New Amsterdam, and the **colony** was named New

Netherlands. Hudson did, however, name the Hudson River after

himself. And so, a Dutch **colony** in North America was established.


Before long, this Dutch **colony** began to develop as an important

fur-trading center. Beaver fur was very popular in Europe, and Henry

Hudson had noted that there was an abundance of beavers in the area.


~~Why did Henry Hudson think that he could get to Asia by sailing~~

~~to North America? (~~ ~~_Many explorers believed that there was a_~~

~~_northwestern water passage that would be a shortcut to the Pacific_~~

~~_Ocean and on to Asia.)_~~


~~Ask students whether they have a question so far and remind them to~~

~~write it on one of their sticky notes.~~



Support


Reread the following
sentences: “Rather than
create boundaries between
the Native Americans
and the colonists, these
exchanges were meant to
be the basis for continuing
social connections
between the groups.” Have
students explain what it
means in their own words.



**Student Reader Pages 154—155**
“Purchase” of Manhattan


It is believed by many historians that

in 1624, Peter Minuit, the governor

of this Dutch **colony**, purchased the

island of Manhattan from a group of









local Native Americans known as the Munsee in exchange for trade

goods worth 60 guilders at the time. A guilder was a unit of Dutch

money, and 60 guilders was very little compared to the value of the

land in Manhattan today. Because many Native Americans did not

share the Europeans’ concept of private land ownership, historians

are not sure whether the Munsee understood what the Dutch



Lesson 11 “The Middle Colonies”
**265**


settlers thought they were purchasing. Nor are historians sure that

the Dutch settlers realized that it was the **custom** of some Native

Americans to negotiate for trade goods in return for allowing others

to pass through or temporarily inhabit the land upon which Natives

were settled. Rather than create boundaries between the Native

Americans and the colonists, these exchanges were meant to be the

basis for continuing social connections between the groups.


So it seems likely that both parties misunderstood the nature of the

exchange. As a result, conflicts arose and continued between the

colonists and the Munsee people just as there had been between

colonists and Native Americans in other regions.


As the Dutch **colony** continued to expand, it began to attract more

Europeans. The **colony** allowed for certain religious freedom, so

people who were not very happy with the leaders of their churches

began to leave their homes and arrive in the colonies. This **colony**

had excellent land for farming and a growing fur trade. English

colonists had set their sights on this area, too. For quite some time

they had **concentrated**, or focused, on establishing colonies to the

north and south of what is now New York, but in 1664 they turned

their attention to this area.


~~What does~~ ~~_set their sights_~~ ~~mean?~~ ~~_(targeted or focused on)_~~







**Student Reader Pages 156—157**
Peter Stuyvesant surrenders to the English


At this time in England, Charles II was

king. His father, Charles I, had been

killed because he was not well liked by

the people, and Charles II had been





**266**



forced to leave England. Later, in 1660, Charles II was invited to return

and become king. If you remember, King Charles II had acquired, or

built up, a great deal of **debt** . This happened during the ten years that

he had been living in exile.


~~What context clues help you to understand what the word~~ ~~_exile_~~

~~means? (~~ ~~_forced to leave_~~ ~~)~~


Unit 9 Colonial America


During this time, Charles II had borrowed an enormous amount of

money from friends. It’s not easy to live like a king when you are not

actually recognized as one.


When Charles II reclaimed his throne, he looked to North America

to solve his **debt** problems. As you know, he had already given land

that did not belong to him in the South to several of his loyal friends.

You might ask: “Why didn’t he give away parts of England?” Well,

because that was against English law. There was no such law in place

to protect the land in North America, and Charles believed he was

entitled to claim this land.


Charles II based this belief on the fact that John Cabot had explored

North America for England back in the late 1400s, well before Henry

Hudson had done so for the Dutch in the early 1600s.


King Charles II put his brother James in charge of coming up with

a plan to take New Netherlands from the Dutch. In 1664, James,

also known as the Duke of York, sent a number of warships to New

Amsterdam **Harbor** . The Dutch had been taken by surprise. Not

only was New Amsterdam poorly defended, but the townspeople did

not particularly like their over-bearing governor at the time, Peter

Stuyvesant (stie-vuh-sant).


They were unwilling to risk their lives for him against the English, so

Peter Stuyvesant had no choice but to surrender.



Challenge


Have students explain why
they think New York City
and Philadelphia grew into
such big cities. (Answers
may vary but should
include: good harbors, wide
rivers, good farming, good
climate, etc.)



**Student Reader Pages 157—159**
New Jersey


And so, the Duke of York had carried out

his mission without firing a single shot.

King Charles II was very pleased indeed.

Although the Dutch did try to take their













**colony** back several times, they were **ultimately** unsuccessful, and by

1669, the area was officially deemed an English **colony** . In honor of the

Duke of York, New Amsterdam became known as New York City, and

New Netherlands was now the **colony** of New York.


Lesson 11 “The Middle Colonies”
**267**


~~Why didn’t the townspeople want to risk their lives to defend~~

~~New Amsterdam? (~~ ~~_They did not like their overbearing governor,_~~

~~_Peter Stuyvesant._~~ ~~)~~


~~Remind students to record any questions they have on their sticky note.~~


Not wanting to be too greedy, and ever grateful to loyal supporters of

the monarchy, the Duke of York gave the southern part of the **colony**

of New York to two of his good friends. These friends were George

Carteret and John Berkeley. This area later became known as New

Jersey, named after the Isle of Jersey in the English Channel.


Soon after, the English took an area, known as Delaware, away from

the Dutch, too. So, the English had now established colonies in three

**distinct** regions: the Southern colonies, which were made up of

Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia; the New

England colonies, made up of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode

Island, and New Hampshire; and the Middle colonies, made up of New

York, New Jersey, and the soon-to-be Pennsylvania, and Delaware.


The population in the Middle colonies grew rapidly. These colonies

attracted not only English people, but people from many other European

countries, too. In fact, the population in all of the English colonies grew,

and within one hundred years after King Charles II reclaimed his throne,

the population would grow to be two million! Two of the most populous

cities in North America at this time were located in the Middle Atlantic

region: New York City and Philadelphia. These cities grew into bustling

commercial centers with large populations.


~~Explain that if something is commercial, it is used to make money.~~





**Student Reader Pages 159—161**
Newly arriving settlers


People who moved to the Middle

colonies from another country

brought with them their own individual

languages, culture, and range of skills.



**268**



The people who settled in the Middle colonies were particularly


Unit 9 Colonial America


**diverse**, or varied. You can imagine hundreds of new arrivals

speaking different languages, wearing different kinds of clothing,

building different types of homes, and eating many different kinds

of food. Despite their differences, however, the people who moved to

North America all had one thing in common: they wanted a better life.


There were also many different reasons people chose to come to the

Middle colonies. One was that this region had good **harbor** areas and

long, wide rivers. The English knew that this region would be good

for trade. Another reason some people were drawn to the Middle

colonies was that the people in charge of governing those colonies

were generally tolerant of people’s religions. For the most part,

elected officials in town and county assemblies in the Middle colonies

made the day-to-day decisions; however, the Duke of York, George

Carteret, and John Berkeley were **ultimately** in charge.


**Student Reader pages 161—163**







Another reason people moved to the

Middle colonies was because it was a good

area in which to farm. The climate and soil

in the Middle colonies, compared to the

North and South, were perfect for farming.





In terms of climate, it was neither too hot nor too cold.


Wheat grew well in these conditions. As a result, these Middle colonies

earned the name “the breadbasket” because they could grow a lot of wheat

and supply large amounts of flour to England, as well as to other English

colonies—particularly in the West Indies. Many **mills** were built in this region

to grind the wheat into flour. The flour was packaged and exported. Other

crops, such as **rye**, potatoes, peas, and flax, also thrived. Farming became

the main **occupation**, or job. There were other **occupations**, too. There was

also a need for sailors, trappers, lumbermen, merchants, and craftsmen.

Shipbuilding became an important industry, too.


Check for Understanding


Have each student write three reasons why people moved to the Middle
colonies and then share with the class.


Lesson 11 “The Middle Colonies”
**269**


**270**



There were some enslaved Africans in the Middle colonies, just as

there were in the Southern colonies. Unlike the Southern colonies,

people in the Middle colonies used the rapidly growing population as

their main source of workers, and they paid them wages. As a result,

there was less dependence on **slavery** than in the South.


Builders were needed in the Middle colonies, too. People built houses of

different styles, often reflecting the cultures of the places in Europe from

where they had come. Networks of roads, though very basic, were slowly

developing. The Great Wagon Road became an important “highway,”

stretching from Pennsylvania, south through Maryland, Virginia, and

North Carolina. Workshops, stores, and coffee shops were opening.

Thanks to an English king who needed money, a vibrant new culture was

emerging three thousand miles away.

» In 1624, Peter Minuit thought he “purchased” the land from the Munsee

Native Americans.


3. **Inferential.** Were the Munsee in agreement about the nature of this

exchange?


» Historians believe that the Munsee may have been intending to build a long-term

exchange relationship with the Dutch, rather than handing over the land to them

for so few goods. Historians suspect that both groups misunderstood the nature

of the exchange.


4. **Inferential.** What were some of the reasons the Dutch, as well as the

English, wanted to establish colonies in North America?


» to exercise religious freedom; to take advantage of rich farmland; to pursue

commercial opportunities in the fur trade, etc.)


5. **Inferential.** Describe other factors that shaped life in the Middle Colonies.


» Fertile soil and a temperate climate allowed for plentiful agriculture; good harbors

and long, wide rivers facilitated immigration and trade; religious tolerance

attracted people from many countries and resulted in a diverse culture.

1. Write the word _dependence_ on the board in cursive to give students an

opportunity to practice decoding the word before discussion. Review syllable

division patterns at this time as well.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard that because of the rapidly growing population

in the Middle colonies, there were many available workers and, consequently,

much less dependence on slavery than in the South.


3. Say the word _dependence_ with me.


4. _Dependence_ means reliance on someone or something for support or help,

or a need for someone or something.


5. Children have a dependence on adults to take care of them. Human beings

have a dependence on food, water, and air in order to live. Crops have a

dependence on good soil, sunlight, and water in order to thrive. The colonies

had a dependence on goods imported from England. The English had a

dependence on timber and wheat from the colonies.


6. What are some examples of people or things you have dependence on? What

things in nature have a dependence on something else? What other things

that you can think of have a dependence on other things? Try to use the word

_dependence_ when you tell about it.


(Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’

responses to make complete sentences: “I have a dependence on . . .” or “A

puppy has dependence on . . . ” or “A plant has a dependence on . . . ” or “A

record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.

For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning consonants?


 - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?

Lesson 12 The Quakers
**281**


**282**



Unit 9 Colonial America


~~Point to the statue of William Penn, the son.~~


It wasn’t an unexpected gift. William Penn had actually asked for this

particular area of land. He had a plan for it, and fortunately for him, the

king had agreed. The king even named this gifted land Pennsylvania,

which means “Penn’s Woods,” in honor of William Penn’s father.


~~Explain that the word~~ ~~_sylvania_~~ ~~comes from the Latin word meaning~~

~~“forest land.”~~


The young William Penn was very happy indeed. Why did he want this

land? Well, he wanted this land for religious reasons.


Admiral Sir William Penn had been a Puritan, but his son was a

member of a Protestant group known as the Society of Friends, more

commonly known as **Quakers. Quakers** believe that all people are

equal in the eyes of God and should be treated equally under the law.

This meant that they treated people with respect and dignity, even

if they were of a different race or religion. They do not believe in war.

**Quakers** do think that everyone can have a direct relationship with

God; and therefore, do not need priests or pastors to help them do

this. And **Quakers** encouraged women to take leadership roles in

ways that were at the time typically held by men.


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Ask students to work with a partner to describe
just how different the Quakers’ beliefs were from other colonists. Have
students share their ideas with the whole class. If students have difficulty,
draw a T-chart on the board to compare and contrast the Quakers and
other colonists.


~~Ask students who else they learned about that believed that women should~~

~~be allowed to take leadership roles in the colony. (Anne Hutchinson).~~


Because of their religious views, **Quakers** refused to support the

Church of England, to swear oaths in court, or to fight in wars. These

beliefs not only challenged the Church of England, but some of the

laws of the land, too. As a result, the **Quakers** were seen as disloyal


Lesson 12 The Quakers
**283**


**284**



and troublesome, and they were persecuted, or treated unfairly, in

England. Many English people, including the king, thought it would be

better if **Quakers** would simply leave England, but even some of the

first English colonies in North America did not welcome **Quakers** .


~~What were some other groups in England who were persecuted for~~

~~their religious beliefs? (~~ ~~_Pilgrims, Puritans, Roman Catholics_~~ ~~)~~


**Show Image U9.L12.2**
Penn and Quakers in Jail


Over the years, William Penn was

arrested and placed in jail many

times for his religious views, as were

other **Quakers** . When he received the

gift of land from the king, he knew

exactly what he wanted to do with it—he planned to create a colony

that would be a “holy experiment.” As the sole owner of this land, like

Roger Williams of Rhode Island, Penn planned to welcome people

of all faiths and those from different countries. Prior to this, a small

group of Quakers had already settled in what is now New Jersey.

However, unlike some other colonists, William Penn intended to pay

for the land he had been given. He wrote to the Lenni Lenape

[len-ee-len-ah-pee] Native Americans of Pennsylvania and told them

he would do so. He also told them that he hoped they could be good

neighbors to each other.


**Show Image U9.L12.3**
Penn’s Plan for Philadelphia


William Penn had a clear idea of how

he wanted his colony to be governed.

He also had a clear idea of what the

main settlement in his colony should

look like. A plan for this future city

was drawn up before it was built. The main settlement would be on

a piece of land between two rivers, the Schuylkill [skoo-kull] and the


Unit 9 Colonial America


Delaware, near one of the largest freshwater harbors in the world.


The settlement would be called Philadelphia—the City of Brotherly

Love. Penn wanted Philadelphia to have a grid pattern of wide, tree
lined streets. He wanted there to be open areas where people could

walk. Philadelphia was the very first English settlement to be planned

before it was built.


~~Explain that the word~~ ~~_phile_~~ ~~means love and~~ ~~_adelphos_~~ ~~means brother.~~

~~Tell students that Philadelphia’s nickname today is still the City of~~

~~Brotherly Love.~~


**Show Image U9.L12.4**
Penn at His Desk


In April 1681, Penn asked his cousin

William Markham to be the deputy

governor of Pennsylvania. His cousin

accepted the position and set off right

away. William Penn stayed behind in

England to create a document that would outline the laws of this new

colony. This document was called the First Frame of Government.


William Penn had decided that his colony would be governed

by elected leaders, not purely by the rich and powerful, as was

the case in England. However, these elected leaders did have to

be Protestants. Although Pennsylvania was governed by elected

leaders, the Penn family was still involved in Pennsylvania’s colonial

government and politics.


People of other religions could settle in this colony and practice their

faith, but they could not vote or hold office. Public education would

be available to all children. There would be the right to trial by jury.


In addition, William Penn believed that the purpose of jail was to

reform, or change, prisoners rather than punish them. And so, in

William Penn’s jails, rather than being locked inside tiny cells, many

prisoners were held in large workhouses where they could spend

their time doing something useful.



Challenge


Ask students to explain
why it might be that
Philadelphia was the first
English settlement to be
planned before it was
built. (Most settlements
started by first making sure
there were shelters for the
colonists and then building
new buildings as needed.)

Penn Speaking with the Lenni Lenape


In October, 1682, William Penn sailed

across the Atlantic Ocean to his new

home on a ship called the _Welcome_ .

As soon as he arrived, he met with the

Native people, the Lenni Lenape, who

are known today as the Delaware Native Americans, and together

they drew up a treaty. Penn also arranged to buy the land he had

been given by King Charles II, rather than just take it.


Before long, Philadelphia became an important center of commerce.

Many people of different religions and nationalities made their homes

there. In the early days, people came to this colony from England,

Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Later, they came from other parts of

Europe, including Germany, France, Poland, and the Netherlands.


~~Ask students whether they remember hearing the word~~ ~~_commercial_~~

~~in a previous lesson and what the definition is. Based on that, what~~

~~does the word~~ ~~_commerce_~~ ~~mean? (~~ ~~_activity that makes money, like_~~

~~_buying and selling_~~ ~~)~~


People even moved to Philadelphia from other English colonies for

multiple reasons, including the many employment opportunities,

the spirit of religious tolerance, and the available farmland and

accessible harbor. As a matter of fact, a few years after Philadelphia’s

**founding,** or establishment, the young Benjamin Franklin moved to

the city to become an apprentice printer. Like New York, Philadelphia

grew into an important city and center of commerce.


~~Ask students to brainstorm everything they know about Benjamin~~

~~Franklin. (~~ ~~_Answers may vary but could include U.S. Founding Father,_~~

~~_author, scientist, or inventor._~~ ~~)~~


Because **Quakers** were strongly opposed to slavery, they established

small farms that could be more easily managed, or controlled, by

fewer people. This is not to say that there weren’t any enslaved


Unit 9 Colonial America


Africans in Pennsylvania—there were. In fact, by 1730, there were four

thousand enslaved Africans in this colony. But that was much fewer

than in the Southern colonies. Ultimately, because **Quakers** felt that

slavery was wrong, they actively fought to abolish, or end, slavery.


**Show Image U9.L12.6**
William Penn Being Arrested


William Penn worked hard in the first

two years to establish this Middle

Colony. Then, in 1684, for a number

of reasons—including a land dispute

with the powerful Lord Baltimore—he

decided to return to England. William left his cousin and another man

in charge. Incredibly, when Penn returned to England, he was arrested

for **treason,** and his rights and access to the colony were taken away

from him.


~~Remind students that~~ ~~_treason_~~ ~~means an act of disloyalty that causes~~

~~harm to one’s country.~~


**Show Image U9.L12.7**
William Penn in Governing
Chamber


In the end, William Penn was found to

be innocent of the **treason** charges

against him. However, he did not return

to Pennsylvania until fifteen years later.

When he did return in 1699, he found that many things had changed.

During that time, thousands of people had moved to Pennsylvania.

With more people came more problems. Being a reasonable man,

William Penn listened carefully to the concerns of the people he had

left in charge and even to those people he had never met before. He

recognized the need for an even more open form of government. In 1701,

William Penn signed the Charter of **Privileges.** This document allowed

A few years later, in 1704, an area in

the southern part of Pennsylvania,

known as the Lower Counties,

was allowed to establish its own

government. This area would

eventually become the colony of

Delaware.

Pennsylvania. In 1708, he was once

again arrested. This time, he was



accused of not paying his debts. Although he was released within a

year with his debts cleared, Penn’s health had started to decline.


William Penn continued to fight for the things he believed in.

Throughout his life, he found himself on the opposing side of popular

opinion. William Penn died in England in 1718, and he was buried next

to his wife in a tiny village called Jordans. He is remembered as the

man who founded the great City of Brotherly Love.


Unit 9 Colonial America


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Which colonies did you hear about in today’s Read-Aloud?


» Pennsylvania and Delaware. (Show Image Card C.U9.L1.1 Regional Map of Colonial

America. Have a volunteer point to the colonies on the map.)


2. **Literal.** How was the colony of Pennsylvania founded?


» King Charles II gave William Penn, the son of Admiral Sir William Penn, the land of

Pennsylvania to repay his debts to the Penn family.


3. **Literal.** What does Pennsylvania mean?


» Penn’s woods


4. **Literal.** What city in Pennsylvania is known as the City of Brotherly Love?


» Philadelphia (Show Image Card C.U9.L1.1 Regional Map of Colonial America. Have

a volunteer point to Philadelphia on the map.)


5. **Inferential.** Who were the Quakers, and what influences did they have on

the colony of Pennsylvania?


» Quakers are a Protestant group that still exists today. They believe that all people

are equal in the eyes of God. Quakers believe that anyone can have a direct

relationship with God, and therefore, do not need priests or pastors to help them.

The Quakers opposed slavery and later fought against it. Some influences that

the Quakers had on the colony of Pennsylvania include that the Quakers opposed

slavery, so they established smaller, more manageable farms in Pennsylvania that

did not require as many workers, and they encouraged women to take leadership

roles, which during the colonial era was very unusual.


6. **Literal.** How was the colony of Delaware founded?


» The southern part of then-Pennsylvania, also called the Lower Counties, was

allowed to have an independent government in 1704.


 - As a class, add the important persons learned about in this chapter to the

Colonial America: Important Persons chart.


Check for Understanding


**Exit Ticket:** Have students write a response to the question, “What were
William Penn’s goals for founding Pennsylvania?” (Penn wanted to create a
colony that would be a “holy experiment.” He planned to welcome people
of all faiths and from all countries.) If students have difficulty, reread
portions of the Read-Aloud.

~~**WORD WORK: FOUNDING (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _founding_ on the board in cursive to give students an

opportunity to practice decoding the word before discussion. Review syllable

division patterns at this time as well.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard that a few years after the founding of

Philadelphia, young Benjamin Franklin moved to the city to become an

apprentice printer.


3. Say the word _founding_ with me.


4. Founding means the act of starting something or creating something new.

In this Read-Aloud, the word _founding_ was used to describe the creation of

the city of Philadelphia. But there can be a founding of many different types

of things, such as organizations (like clubs), businesses, charities, or other

institutions. A founding is different from a finding. A finding is a discovery of

something, such as a medical finding of a cure; a founding is the creation of

something from the bottom up, or from its foundation.


5. Clara Barton, the famous Civil War nurse, is credited with the founding of the

Red Cross.


6. Organizations or groups are always founded by a person or group of people,

and they are founded for different reasons. For example, Clara Barton

founded the Red Cross to help people who were injured or in need of help.

Try to think of another organization or group, and talk about some possible

reasons for the founding of that organization or group. Try to use the word

_founding_ when you tell about it.


 - Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide or rephrase students’

responses to make complete sentences: “The founding of came

about because. . .”


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the

word _founding_ ?


 - Complete a _Making Choices_ activity as a follow-up. Directions: “I am going

to read several examples to you. If the example I read is a correct use of the

word _founding_, say, ‘Yes, that is a founding.’ If the example is not a correct

use of _founding_, say, ‘No, that is not a founding.’”


1. Benjamin Franklin was responsible for founding the first lending library.

(Yes, that is a founding.)

**294**



The village was on the bank of a long, winding river.
In the village, there were about thirty wigwams and four
longhouses. Like the wigwams, the longhouses were
made from a wooden frame covered in bark. Unlike the
wigwams, though, several families lived together in one
longhouse. On the **outskirts** of the village, the children
could see the Lenni Lenape fields full of corn, squash,
and beans. In the river near the bank, four dugout
canoes were bobbing up and down in the water. Two of
the canoes held piles of raccoon, beaver, and fox fur. This
fur was a sign that some of the Lenni Lenape men would
soon be setting off to trade with either Europeans or
other Native Americans.

Unit 9 Colonial America


Charles and Hester were Quakers from a part of
England called the Midlands. They had arrived in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the previous year with their
parents. Philadelphia was a growing town in the English
**colony** known as Pennsylvania. In 1681, William Penn,
a Quaker and the leader of this **colony**, had received the
land now known as Pennsylvania from King Charles II
of England. The king had given him the land to settle
a **debt** he owed to William’s father. William Penn was
grateful to the king because he wanted this land to be a
place where Quakers could live without fear. Quakers
were **persecuted** in England. They were often arrested
and some were killed because of their beliefs.





168 169


Lesson 12 The Quakers
**295**


Quakers were unpopular because they did not believe
in war, and therefore, refused to fight. Also, they did
not think that there was only one way to **worship** God.
They did not think that it was necessary to have a priest
or pastor to **worship**, either. They also believed that
everyone was equal in the eyes of God, which meant
that Native Americans and Africans who were enslaved
were equal, too. These views made members of the king’s
government very angry. The king himself was not pleased
with them. William Penn decided that it was time to
find a safe place for Quakers to live.


Before leaving England in 1681, William Penn drew
up a plan for the city of Philadelphia. He wanted it to
have wide, tree-lined streets and public parks. He wanted
Philadelphia to be a magnificent city within the **colony**
of Pennsylvania. He wanted it to be a place where people
lived in such a way that they were an example to the
rest of the world. People of all faiths, not only Quakers,
would be welcome.

As the children neared the village, a Lenni
Lenape boy ran toward them. He had clearly been
waiting for them.


“Hello, Lapowinsa,” said Charles to the boy.


“Hey,” replied Lapowinsa. “What do you have in
the baskets?”


Both Charles and Hester had taught Lapowinsa to
speak English. He was their friend and they enjoyed
spending time with him.


“We have gifts,” Hester replied. Lapowinsa joined
the children as they marched behind their father into the
Lenni Lenape village.


The people in the village smiled at the children’s
father. They came to greet him. Charles always **admired**
the breechcloths and leggings, worn in cold weather, that
the men wore. The women wore dresses, and their long,
dark hair was braided. The men, women, and children
wore moccasins on their feet.

Language


**Primary Focus** : Students will determine the meaning of words with prefixes _over_ –,

_mid_ –, and _under_ –. ~~**TEKS 3.2.A.v; TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.3.C**~~


Students will spell words correctly using spelling patterns and rules for the sound

/ou/. ~~**TEKS 3.2.B.i**~~


~~**MORPHOLOGY: PREFIXES OVER–, MID–, AND UNDER– (20 MIN.)**~~


**Prefixes over–, mid–, and under–**


 - Review with students that prefixes are added to the beginning of words.

Adding prefixes may change a word’s part of speech.

 - Have students turn and talk with a partner to explain the process of adding the

prefix _re-_ to verbs and how it transforms them into different parts of speech.

Provide an example before students begin. Example: Adding _re-_ to the root

word _read_ makes _reread_, which means to read again.

 - Tell students that the prefixes they will learn about this week are added to

English root words to make new words.

 - Tell students that this week they will learn three prefixes: _over_ –, _mid_ –, and _under_ –.

Ask: “Can you think of any words with these prefixes? What do you think these

prefixes mean in a word?” Encourage students to share any words they already

know with these prefixes.


Prefix over–


 - Explain to students that _over–_ means “too much.”

 - Tell students that they will add _over–_ to root words that are verbs and

adjectives. The new words created have the same part of speech as the

root words.

 - Write _charge,_ in cursive on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning and then

use it in a sentence. (to ask for payment; The hot dog vendor will charge half

price after four o’clock.)

 - Add the prefix _over–_ to _charge,_ and have students read the prefix, read the

new word, and then discuss the new meaning. (to ask for too much payment)


**TEKS 3.2.A.v** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of prefixes; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write
complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words; **TEKS 3.3.C** Identify

Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables, open syllables, VCe syllables,
vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs, r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables.

- Share the following example of the use of _overcharge_ in a sentence:


   - He worried that the cashier would _overcharge_ him for the items he

selected since he had so many of them.


- Ask students for examples of things that could be overcharged. (Answers may

vary but could include a bill at a restaurant, a department store purchase, or

the total cost for a service provided.)


- Point out to students that the addition of the prefix _over–_ does not change the

part of speech of the word. The root word _charge_ is a verb in this instance, and

_overcharge_ is also a verb. Remind students that verbs are action words.


- Continue in this manner for the remaining _over–_ words, using the following

chart as a guide.


- Encourage students to share any other words they know with the prefix _over_ -.

Prefix mid–


 - Explain to students that _mid–_ means “middle.”


 - Tell students that they will add _mid–_ to root words that are nouns. The new

words created are also nouns.


 - Write _day_ in cursive on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning of the word and

then use it in a sentence.


    - the period of light between one night and the next; Twice a week, my mom

stays home during the day.


 - Add the prefix _mid–_ to _day,_ and have students read the prefix, read the new

word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word.


    - the middle of the day


 - Share the following example of the use of _midday_ in a sentence:


    - The soup kitchen at the church opened at _midday_ on Thursdays and Fridays.


 - Ask students for examples of things that could happen at midday. (Answers

may vary but could include lunch, recess, or 12:00 p.m. on a clock.) Point out

to students that the addition of the prefix _mid–_ does not change the part of

speech of the word. The root word _day_ is a noun, and _midday_ is also a noun.

Remind students that nouns are people, places, or things.


 - Continue in this manner for the remaining _mid–_ words, using the following

- Encourage students to share any other words they know with the prefix _mid_ -.


Prefix under–


- Explain to students that _under–_ means “below” or “less.”


- Tell students that they will add _under–_ to root words that are nouns, verbs, and

adjectives. The new words created may not be the same part of speech as the root

words and could be nouns, verbs, or adjectives. Students will have to examine how

these words are used in sentences to help them remember the part of speech.


- Write _ground_ on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning of the word and then

use it in a sentence. (the surface of the earth; I dropped my keys on the ground

because I had too many things to carry.) Have students identify the part of

speech. (noun)


- Add the prefix _under–_ to _ground,_ and have students read the prefix, read the

new word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word. (below the surface

of the earth)


- Share the following example of the use of _underground_ in a sentence:


- Construction on the new _underground_ tunnel for the highway was delayed due

to flooding after a storm.


- Ask students for examples of things that could be underground.


» Answers may vary but could include pipes, water, the subway, or tunnels.


- Continue in this manner for the remaining _under–_ words, using the following

chart as a guide.

**Show Image U9.L13.1**
Regional Map of Industry Icons


You have learned about the many

reasons people from all over Europe

traveled thousands of miles across





the Atlantic Ocean to establish


Unit 9 Colonial America


and live in the thirteen colonies. Kings, trading companies, and

influential Englishmen all realized that North America had enormous

**potential.** In other words, they all thought they could get rich

there. Others wanted to start a new life, free of religious intolerance

and persecution.


People from England and other parts of Europe traveled to different

regions for different reasons. Slowly, these regions—and the colonies

within them—began to take shape. The Southern colonies had warm

weather and adequate rainfall. Small farms and large plantations

began to dot the landscape. The large plantations had many enslaved

Africans working on them. The economy in the South was based on

farming cash crops such as tobacco, rice, and indigo. Tobacco, rice,

and indigo were exported to England and the West Indies and sold by

merchants there. Trade among the thirteen colonies also began

to grow.


The soil in the New England colonies was not as suitable for farming.

There were some small farms, but due to the abundance of forests,

timber became an important trade good. Over in England, many

of the forests had been cut down by the time the colonies were

established, so timber to make ships and homes was exported to

England. Other colonies also needed timber to build fishing and

trading ships, homes, and barrels.


~~Ask students, “What do you think barrels were used for?”~~ ~~_(They were_~~

~~_used to store and transport many items, including drinks, and even nails.)_~~


Farming was a main source of income in the Middle colonies.

Wheat was grown so abundantly that this region had a special

name. Mills were built, and the wheat produced was ground into flour

and sold to other colonies. Large amounts of flour were also sold

to England and its colonies in the West Indies. Settlers from around

the world came to this region, resulting in a wide variety of cultures

within the Middle colonies.

One-room Schoolhouse


Can you imagine what it was like

to grow up back then? Let’s find

out what life was like in the English

colonies. In the early days, only boys

who lived in Massachusetts had to go to school. The first schools

were one-room schoolhouses.


- Tell students to look at Activity Page 13.1. The first box is labeled “Education”

and has places for colonial times and today. Tell students to listen carefully for

details they can add to their graphic organizer.


Boys of different ages learned reading, writing, and math.

Sometimes, the older boys helped to teach the younger ones. In 1647,

a law was passed in Massachusetts that required every town with fifty

or more families to support an elementary school. Towns with more

than one hundred families had to support a grammar school, where

boys would learn Latin to prepare for college. This was the beginning

of **public** education in America. Over time, every colony began to

provide a basic **public** education. The very first college, Harvard,

was founded in New England in 1636. In 1693, the second college,

the College of William and Mary, was founded in Virginia. William and

Mary was named after King William III and Queen Mary II of England.


~~Explain that public education is education that is supported by and~~

~~available to the community. You may wish to specifically discuss your~~

~~school and provide examples of other types of schools as they apply.~~


Unit 9 Colonial America


**Show Image U9.L13.3**
Skills Boys and Girls Learned


Some boys attended private schools,

and others were educated at home.

Puritan girls were taught to read so

they could read the Christian Bible.


For many children, the main part of their education was learning a

skill so that they could grow up and support a family. For girls, that

meant learning household skills such as cooking, keeping a vegetable

garden, sewing, making candles, and raising children. Some girls

might learn to become dressmakers.


~~Why do you think the colonists had to learn to make candles?~~


For boys, farming was one of the main occupations. There were

many different kinds of apprenticeships, too. Boys as young as

eleven years old would serve as apprentices and learn a skill

from an experienced artisan. They could learn to be shoemakers,

blacksmiths, carpenters, shipbuilders, printers, surveyors, millers,

merchants, and glassmakers, among other things. Boys could also

train to become lawyers, doctors, or teachers.


**Show Image U9.L13.4**
Boy Apprentice Learning to be a Cooper


Boys would often leave home at

the age of eleven and go to live as

apprentices with the skilled artisans

who were training them. Their

workday was usually about twelve

hours long. Apprentices were provided with food and a place to live,

but they were not paid. Apprenticeships usually lasted for several

years. At the end of their apprenticeship, they would join an existing

business or start their own.

how apprenticeships
work today. What ages

- Tell students to write details about education now in the “Today” part of the

graphic organizer.


**Show Image U9.L13.5**
Daily Chores


Even young children had lots of chores

to do. If you lived on a farm—and

many people did—you would gather

firewood, tend to the farm animals,

milk the cows, collect eggs from the

chickens, make candles, plant and

harvest vegetables, and carry water

from the well. Almost all of your food

came from your farm. All of this had to be accomplished without

the luxuries of electricity, indoor plumbing, or central heating or

air conditioning.


- Tell students to write details about daily chores in the “Colonial” column of

Activity Page 13.1. Then, tell students to write in details about the daily chores

they may have in the “Today” part of the graphic organizer.

Cornhusk Dolls


~~Tell students to listen carefully to how~~

~~colonial children played and to record~~

~~the details in their graphic organizer.~~


Life in the colonies was not all work

and no play. Because children spent a large part of their day doing

chores, they often found ways to make a game out of their work. For

instance, if they were gardening, they might have a game of hide-and
seek after they finished weeding the garden or picking the vegetables.

If they were carding wool, carrying firewood, or churning butter, siblings

might race one another to see who would finish first. Children might

also sing songs, or exchange stories and riddles as they worked. When


Unit 9 Colonial America



**316**


their chores were finished, they played games like blind man’s bluff,

hopscotch, tag, and a form of jacks using rocks.


~~Explain to students that carding wool means to separate the wool fibers~~

~~in preparation for spinning the wool into thread for yarn. Blind man’s~~

~~bluff is a game where one person is blind folded, spins around in circles,~~

~~then tries to tag their friends. In the game Jacks, you bounce a small ball~~

~~and try to pick up a small piece of metal in the shape of an X (the jack),~~

~~before catching the ball again. The player who can pick up the most~~

~~jacks with one hand and catch the ball after one bounce is the winner.~~


There were no toy stores, so colonists made toys from things they had

in their homes or farms, such as dolls from corn husks or rags. If they

had some wood, leather, or string left over, they might make a toy out

of it, such as a top or spinner, or a game like the familiar cup-and-ball

game. Colonists made board games they could play, too. One favorite

toy might be a hoop left over from barrel-making. Children would turn

the hoops on their sides and roll them with a stick through the streets.


 - Tell students to complete adding the details to the “Play” row under the

“Colonial” column and to complete the “Today” column.


**Show Image U9.L13.7**
Puritan Service


Religion played a key role in the

development of many of the colonies.

Christians often read from their

Bible to their children, and children

memorized passages from it because

this helped them follow the values of their parents. For Christians in

New England, attending church was the most important thing they

did. In fact, if you were a Puritan, it was **compulsory.**


~~Ask students whether they remember what~~ ~~_compulsory_~~ ~~means from~~

~~the vocabulary preview.~~ ~~_(required by rule or law)_~~


Lesson 13 Colonial Life
**317**


**318**



Puritans worshiped in a meetinghouse. Sermons could last for

several hours. If you fell asleep during the service, there was

sometimes someone assigned to wake you up. That person had a

long pole with feathers on one end. If someone fell asleep, he tickled

the sleeper’s chin with the feathers.


As you learned, in the early days of the colonies, most people

produced the food they ate. Corn was a very important crop to the

colonists, as it was to many Native Americans. Colonists used corn

in a variety of ways: there was corn bread, corn cake, boiled and

fried corn, corn soup, and corn on the cob. Besides farming, some

colonists also hunted and fished. The colonists learned to harvest

regional fruits and berries, and they used them in their cooking for

seasoning and pies. Apparently, colonists had a very sweet tooth!

Historians have recorded stories about how colonists loved hard

candies, pies, and puddings.


~~Tell students that colonists had none of the advanced dentistry~~

~~techniques we have today, so many had to have their teeth pulled out~~

~~because of tooth decay.~~


**Show Image U9.L13.8**
Colonial Architecture: New England,
Middle Atlantic, Southern


As the colonies grew in size, towns

became large cities. Boston, New York,

Philadelphia, and Charleston became

the largest. The architectural style of

each region often **imitated,** or copied, the European countries where

many of the colonists originated. There were many red brick, English
style homes in New England; Dutch-style wooden houses with sloping

roofs in the Middle Atlantic; and French-style farmhouses with

wide porches and French doors in the Southern region. In addition,

Charleston architecture has a Caribbean influence because many

settlers arrived there from the English island of Barbados in the

Caribbean Sea.


Unit 9 Colonial America


The streets of these towns and cities became busy with horses,

wagons, and people. Not everyone worked as a farmer, artisan, or

apprentice. There were many wealthy people who lived in very fine

houses in these large cities. Their homes contained only the best

furniture, silver, china, and fabrics shipped from England. In the early

days of the colonies, people relied heavily on imported goods from

England. As the years went by, the colonists began to **manufacture,**

or produce, some of these things themselves. However, the English

Parliament still controlled how much **manufacturing** the colonists

were allowed to do. The English did not want to lose the money they

made by selling their goods to the colonists.


**Show Image U9.L13.9**
Fancy Period Clothing


The wealthy colonists paid attention

to English fashions and, even on the

hottest days, could be seen wearing

the most elaborate clothing made of

the finest materials. Men wore lace

stockings and ruffles. They carried swords and powdered their hair.

Women wore big, puffy, many-layered dresses and towering hair

designs when they were in fashion.


Those less affluent colonists who did physical work wore clothes

that were made from simpler materials. They often made their own

clothes or wore clothes given to them by others.


 - Tell students to complete the details for clothing in the “Colonial” column.

Then, have them complete details in the “Today” column.

Colonial Town


Communication between the colonies

was difficult. Most roads were nothing

more than wagon trails, although in the

larger cities there were a few established

“highways.” Ships traveled up and down

rivers and along the coast to bring goods and news from far away.

Written communication was one of the only ways of sending and

receiving messages, but letters could take weeks—if not months—to

arrive. Frequently, letters would go missing.


Medicine then was basic, and people died of diseases that are quite

**curable** today. Women gave birth at home with the help of midwives.

Because they did not have the medical care we do today, sometimes

women died in childbirth, and many babies died before reaching their

first birthday. However, life away from the crowded European towns

and cities was somewhat healthier.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to check whether their predictions were correct about
everyday life in colonial America. Why or why not? (You may wish to revisit
the list you recorded on the board or chart paper during Introducing the
Read-Aloud.)


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


- Divide the students into small groups of 4–5 students each.


- Have students take turn sharing the details they collected in their

“Matthew, have you finished
printing those newspapers?” Uncle
Abraham asked.


“Almost,” Matthew replied.





“Well, when you are done, I need you to deliver
these sermons to Pastor Keller. He’s waiting for them,”
continued Uncle Abraham. “Oh, and when you get
back from delivering the sermons, you will need to
make more ink.”


Matthew nodded his head to let his uncle know that
he had heard his instructions. In 1755, Matthew was
a printer’s **apprentice** . He was **originally** from a small
village thirty miles north of Philadelphia. Matthew’s
father was a cooper there. A cooper is a skilled **craftsman**
who knows how to make casks, buckets, barrels, and
containers of all shapes and sizes. In the colonies, almost
every kind of food and drink was stored in the kinds of
containers his father made.

» Matthew was offered the opportunity to be an apprentice to his Uncle Abraham,

a printer, so he could learn a skill to be able to support a family when he grew up.

Matthew signed an apprenticeship agreement and then moved to Philadelphia

to live with his uncle. Matthew would be an apprentice for seven years and would

then become a journeyman. After being a journeyman for three years, Matthew

would be a master craftsman and hopefully open his own business.


Unit 9 Colonial America


When Matthew was little, he had thought that
he would one day work with his father. However,
his older brother Jonah had become their father’s
**apprentice** . From the age of seven until he was ten,
Matthew had attended a one-room schoolhouse where
he was fortunate enough to have been taught how to
read and write.


Four days after his eleventh birthday, Matthew’s
Uncle Abraham had come to visit. During his visit,
he had offered Matthew the opportunity to move to
Philadelphia and become his **apprentice** . At first,
Matthew had not wanted to leave his family. He
had three younger sisters he loved dearly, along with
his brother Jonah. However, Matthew’s parents had
explained to him that he would have to learn a skill so
that when he grew up he too could support a family.

Before Uncle Abraham left, Matthew had signed an
**apprenticeship** agreement that stated that he “would
faithfully serve his uncle, keep his secrets, and obey all of
his lawful commands.” For his part, Uncle Abraham had
agreed to spend seven years teaching him the skills he
needed to be a successful printer. During that time, he
would house, feed, and clothe Matthew. Four weeks after
his uncle’s visit, Matthew’s father had loaded up their
wagon and they had set off for Philadelphia.

In Philadelphia, Matthew and his father had spent
two days exploring the city with Uncle Abraham. Then
on the third day, his father had bought supplies for his
workshop and said goodbye. Matthew had watched his
father go until he was out of sight. Though his eyes filled
with tears, Matthew willed them not to fall.


Four years had passed since that day. Now, Matthew
was fifteen years old. Matthew had three more years to
serve as an **apprentice** . When his seven years of training
were finished, Matthew would become a journeyman.
A journeyman was a skilled printer, though not yet a
master **craftsman** . Matthew would spend three more
years working alongside his uncle and he would receive
payment for his work. When he turned twenty-one years
of age, Matthew hoped to become a master **craftsman**
and open up his own business.

Matthew finished printing the last newspaper.
Printing newspapers was one of the hardest jobs of
all. It could take more than twenty hours to print one
page. All of the work was done by hand. This included
organizing tiny pieces of metal with individual letters
or punctuation marks on them into the order in which
they had to appear on the printed page. This task was
called setting the type. The type was then held firmly
in place as an inking pad spread ink over the type. The
printing press transferred the carefully arranged words
and sentences onto paper.


Matthew picked up the bundle of printed sermons
and quickly checked to see if he had all of the ingredients
needed to make the ink when he returned. Ink was
made from **tannin**, iron sulfate, gum, and water. He was
happy to see that Uncle Abraham had stocked up on
these supplies.

 - Have students work in small groups to answer the discussion question, “Do

you think being a printer’s apprentice is a good opportunity for Matthew? Why

or why not?”


» Answers may vary but could include that it was a good opportunity because

Matthew’s older brother had already become their father’s apprentice so Matthew

would need to be trained to do something else. Since Matthew had been fortunate

enough to learn how to read and write, he had the skills necessary to become an

apprentice to a printer. Being able to read and write may not have been necessary

to become a cooper. Matthew would need to learn a skill so he could support a

family when he grew up. Students may feel that it was not a good opportunity

because Matthew would have to leave his father, mother, sisters, and brother to

move to Philadelphia, which made him sad because he loved his family. He also

was only 11 years old and would spend 7 years serving as an apprentice and 3

more years as a journeyman.

**Subject Pronouns**


A **pronoun** is a part of speech that takes the place of a noun. Every

pronoun always refers to a specific noun. When a pronoun is the subject of

the sentence, it is called a subject pronoun.


**Pronouns and Pronoun Antecedents**


**Pronouns** are words that take the place of nouns.

**Pronoun antecedents** are the words to which the pronouns refer.

Pronouns and their antecedents must agree in number and gender.


- Ask students to name subject pronouns they learned in an earlier lesson.


» _I_, _you_, _he_, _she_, _it_, _we_, _you_, _they_


- Write the following sentences in cursive on the board, read them aloud, and

have students identify the subject pronouns.


1. She and I play on the same team. (she, I)


2. It rained last night so we didn’t play the baseball game. (we)


3. You should go with John to the game. (you)

- Ask students if in these sentences a reader can tell who the pronouns refer

to. In other words, ask students, “Who is she in ‘She and I play on the same

team’?”


» You can’t tell because there is not enough information.


- Ask, “Who are we in ‘It rained last night so we didn’t play the basketball game’?”


» You can’t tell because there is not enough information.


- Ask, “Who are you in ‘You should go with John to the game’?”


» You can’t tell because there is not enough information.


- Tell students that in sentences, where the reader can identify the noun that the

pronoun refers to, that noun is called the pronoun antecedent.


- Write the following sentences in cursive on the board, read them aloud, and

have students identify the pronouns.


1. Sam lost the game, and he was upset. (he)


2. Nina and Nora won the game, and they were thrilled. (they)


- Ask, “In the first sentence, who does the pronoun _he_ refer to?”


» Sam


Unit 9 Colonial America


 - Tell students that _Sam_ is the noun _he_ refers to in the sentence.

(pronoun antecedent)


 - Ask, “In the second sentence, whom does the pronoun _they_ refer to?”


» Nina and Nora


 - Tell students that _Nina_ and _Nora_ are the nouns _they_ refers to in the sentence.

(pronoun antecedents)


**Agreement in Number**


 - Tell students that a pronoun and its antecedent must “agree” in number, which

means that in a sentence, a pronoun and the noun the pronoun refers to (its

antecedent) must both be either singular or plural.


 - Write the following sentences in cursive on the board, read them aloud to

students, and ask which is correct.


1. Dave and Donna were happy that they were going to the movies.


2. Dave and Donna were happy that he was going to the movies.


 - Ask, “What is the subject of both of the sentences?” (Dave and Donna)


 - Ask, “Is the subject of the two sentences singular or plural?”


» two people (Dave and Donna) = plural


 - Ask students to find the pronoun in each sentence. (they, he)


 - Ask, “Which pronoun, _they_ or _he_, is a plural pronoun?” (they) Ask, “Which

sentence is correct because it agrees in number, that is, which sentence has

both the pronoun and the nouns it refers to plural?”


» the first one, because the pronoun _they_ is plural and _Dave and Donna_ is plural


 - Write the following sentences in cursive on the board, read them aloud, and

ask students to choose the correct pronoun.


1. Princess, my kitten, won the hearts of all because is so cute. ( _she_ or
_they_ : _she_ because _Princess_ and _she_ are both singular)


2. Zachary and Tom are brothers, and like to play chess together. ( _he_

or _they_ : _they_ because _Zachary_ _and_ _Tom_ and _they_ are both plural)


3. My cousins and I are so sad because aren’t tall enough to get on
the ride at the park. ( _it_ or _we_ : _we_ because _my_ _cousins_ _and_ _I_ and _we_ are
both plural)

4. The new book in the library has the whole class talking about . ( _they_

or _it_ : _it_ because _book_ and _it_ are both singular)


- Point out to students that in each sentence, the correct pronoun was either

singular or plural to match the noun(s) it referred to (its pronoun antecedent).


**Agreement in Gender**


- Tell students that a pronoun and its antecedent must “agree” in gender, which

means that in a sentence, a pronoun and the noun it refers to (its antecedent)

must both be either masculine (male) or feminine (female).


- Write the following sentences in cursive on the board, read them aloud, to

students and ask which they think is correct.


1. William is a duck, and he is yellow.


2. William is a duck, and she is yellow.


- Ask, “What is the subject of both of the sentences?”


» William


- Ask, “Is William a boy duck or a girl duck?”


» boy


- Ask students to find the pronoun in each sentence.


» he, she


- Ask, “Which sentence is correct because it agrees in gender, in other words,

which sentence has both the noun _William_ and the pronoun _he_ referring to a

boy duck?”


» the first one


- Write the following sentences in cursive on the board, read them aloud, and

ask students to choose the correct pronoun.


1. Linda loves her new bicycle, and rides it every day. ( _she_ or _he_ : _she_

because _Linda_ and _she_ are both girls)


2. Tom received a present, and opened it quickly. ( _she_ or _he_ : _he_

because _Tom_ and _he_ are both boys) Point out to students that in each

case, the correct pronoun referred to either a boy or a girl (masculine or

feminine) to match the pronoun antecedent.


**Reciprocal Pronouns**


- Tell students that there are two pronouns that are used to show an action that

is being performed by two or more individuals, each on the other and doing

the same thing.


Unit 9 Colonial America


- Write _each_ _other_ and _one_ _another_ in cursive on the board.


- Write the following sentences in cursive on the board, read them aloud,

Toni and Debra competed against each other.

The girls were playing with one another.


- Explain to students that a quick way to know which one to use is to look at the

antecedent. If the antecedent is two things (like Toni and Debra), use each

_other_ . If the antecedent is three or more things (girls in the sentence above

could be more than two), then use one _another_ .

They’ll say no though. They don’t like us keeping
animals inside the house.”


“I’ll hide it in a safe place,” said Patience firmly.


“Where?” asked Primrose quite seriously. “Where will
you hide it? I can’t think of one place that Mama and
Papa wouldn’t find it.”


“In a bucket,” announced Patience confidently.


“Do you think that a kitten will stay in a bucket
all day, waiting for you to finish your chores?” laughed
Primrose. “Do you think Mama and Papa won’t notice
you carrying a bucket around everywhere?”


Patience thought about this for a while before she
replied. Then she said, “The kitten will stay in the
bucket if I train her to.” Patience chose to ignore the
second part of Primrose’s question.


The two girls continued to debate about whether
or not it was possible to hide a kitten in their small log
house without anyone noticing. Like many colonial
cabins, theirs consisted of two small rooms downstairs
and three very small bedrooms upstairs. Primrose and
Patience shared a bedroom, as did their three brothers.

Unit 9 Colonial America


Primrose and Patience lived on a farm in southern
New Jersey. They and the rest of their family were
**originally** from Sweden. They had moved to this
English **colony** because of their Uncle Sven. He had
written to their father and told him about the wonderful
life they could have there.


Uncle Sven had traveled to New Jersey from Sweden
in 1699. That was exactly thirty years after the English
had taken control of this region from the Dutch. Uncle
Sven was now a successful wheat farmer.


The girls and their family had arrived in New Jersey
in 1701. Primrose and Patience lived with their father,
mother, and three brothers on a one hundred acre farm.
On their farm, they grew wheat, **rye**, and **barley** . They
kept cows, pigs, and chickens, too. Most people in
the Middle Atlantic colonies lived on small farms that
ranged from fifty acres to one hundred fifty acres. These
farms were quite spread apart, and neighbors didn’t
see much of each other except at church on Sunday.
Sometimes they got together for special **occasions** or if
someone needed help.

Lesson 14 Life on the Farm

The farm that the girls lived on had a house and
a large barn. They had a garden where they grew
vegetables, berries, and fruits. They had a small orchard,
too. Their garden was fenced, as was the area where
they kept their pigs. Their cows were sent out to **graze**
in the pasture each morning and brought back into the
barn each night for milking. Their farm animals were
valuable, and they kept a close eye on them.


After a while, the girls’ older brother Lars found
them by the shrub. Lars had been sent to look for them
by their father. He sat down beside the girls and peeked
at the kittens. Finally, he spoke.


“You two are needed in the barn. Papa wants you
to lead the cows out into the pasture. Then, Mama
wants you to weed and water the garden. After that, she
wants you to go inside and help her with the new quilt
she is making.”

Do you remember that in the last

and Primrose? They found something very
special under a shrub. Who can remember
what it was? When you left them, they had
set off to do their chores. Let’s find out what’s
happened to them.





**344**



The girls’ uncle had given them good **advice** about
the Middle Atlantic colonies. These colonies offered
people from Europe new opportunities as well as
religious freedom. Although these were English colonies,
Germans, Dutch, French, Swedish, and Irish people
came to live in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and
Pennsylvania. Every day, more and more people arrived
to start a new life.


_Colonists arrived from many different European countries._

Unit 9 Colonial America


Papa often told the children stories about his trips
into town. He would tell them of all the different
languages he heard being spoken there. He would
describe the people who came from many different parts
of Europe. He would **occasionally** bring home strange
and unusual foods he had bought from the market or the
street vendors. One of their favorites was English ‘pop
robbins’. The girls looked forward to the delicious balls
of batter made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Papa
would describe the styles of clothes people wore and the
different **customs** he had heard about.


Almost all of their neighbors were from different
parts of Europe. Their closest neighbor was a family
from Germany. In the first years of the 18th century,
German families had begun to arrive in this **colony** . At
harvest thanksgiving time, their German neighbors had
cooked scrapple and brought it to their home. The boys
had loved this pudding dish of meat and grain. The girls
were less thrilled, but they had loved the apple strudel
that followed. The girls and their family had also been
invited to visit with an Irish family who lived about a
mile away. Mama had been amazed by how much the
Irish family liked to eat butter and cream.



_Families from different countries ate together._

It was a well-known fact that the Middle Atlantic
colonies produced more food than the New England
colonies. The soil in the Middle Atlantic colonies was so
much better for farming. For this reason, these colonies
had earned the name ‘the breadbasket of the colonies’.
They produced huge amounts of **rye**, **barley**, and wheat,
their most important crop. Farmers sent their grain
harvest to the water-powered **mills** across the region. At
the **mills**, the grain was turned into flour. The flour was
sold to other colonies and to people in the West Indies.
It was even sold to English merchants, who shipped it
to England. The girls’ mother often joked that they were
helping to feed the King of England himself.


_A water-powered_ _**mill**_

Unit 9 Colonial America


The Middle Atlantic colonies were not only known
for farming. Along the coast, fisherman fished and
skilled craftsmen built boats and ships. Men cut down
trees from the forests and turned them into lumber to be
used to make boats as well as to be shipped to towns and
cities in England.


Because people of different faiths were free to
**worship** as they wished, different kinds of churches were
springing up throughout the Middle Atlantic colonies.
There were various Christian churches, including the
Lutheran church that the girls’ family attended. Like
the children’s family, most of the Swedish settlers were
Lutheran. There were Jewish temples, too. Small, oneroomed schoolhouses were also beginning to appear.
Only boys could attend them. The girls’ two older
brothers went to school to learn reading, writing, and
manners. When they weren’t at school, Papa taught the
boys how to hunt, farm, build fences, and make tools.


_The girls’ family attended a Lutheran church._

Primrose and Patience went about doing their chores.
They led the cows into the pasture. The cows followed
them **obediently** along the familiar track. After that,
they weeded and watered the newly planted vegetable
garden, stopping only once to drink water from the well
and to put on their sun bonnets. They did not speak
much as they worked. Primrose hummed to herself as
she worked though. As they neared the end of their task,
Patience looked up and exclaimed, “I know! I will hide
my kitten in my pocket. That way, she can come with
me everywhere I go. Her name will be Midnight.”


Primrose glanced at her sister and sighed. There was
no point disagreeing with her or even pointing out the
fact that her kitten would grow into a cat. It was clear
that Patience was determined to have a pet kitten.

Unit 9 Colonial America


- Have students get into the small groups you previously assigned for the

writing lesson.

- Tell students that as a group, they will decide which character from our

reading they would like to write about.

- After deciding on their character, they will need to reread the last chapter in which

that character appeared in order to plan how they would write the next chapter.

- Explain that they should also skim all the chapters the character appeared in

to gather research for their writing. These are sources for their research. Point

out that it can be useful to think ahead of time about the questions you want

your research to answer. That way, when you skim the source, you can look for

certain words or phrases.

- Point out that students will be taking notes on their sources. Ask: What is

plagiarism? (writing down the work of someone else and claiming it as your

own) What might be some good ways to make sure you don't plagiarize as you

take notes? (paraphrase; use a highlighter to mark a direct quote, so you can

check that you have reworded it; think of a new story to tell instead of retelling

what you read)

- Tell students that in order for the group to work together efficiently, they’ll

assign their group members to different roles.

- Direct students to the Shared Writing Roles Poster you previously prepared.

Explain that while each group member is expected to contribute, they’ll need

to assign the following roles in their groups.

**Note:** You may wish to preassign these roles to group members.

   - Group Leader: keeps everyone on track; encourages members to do

their best

   - Researcher: writes down ideas and notes during research

   - Scribe: writes down the text of the new chapter

   - Fact Checker: makes sure the facts from the research are used in the chapter

   - Reader: reads the final version of the chapter aloud to the class


- Explain that while they’ll all be doing research today, the Group Leader will be

making sure everyone is on track, and the Researcher will be recording the

information. Remind students that research is more effective when it follows a

plan. Make sure the group agrees about the information it needs to find.


Check for Understanding


Have each group make a list of the tasks they must do in the order they must
do them. Have volunteers share their group’s list with the class. If there are

misconceptions, go over the directions for the task again to clarify.

**Practice prefixes over–, mid–, and under–**


 - Remind students that in the previous lesson, they learned about the prefixes

_over_ –, _mid_ –, and _under_ –. Let's recall that knowledge. Write in cursive a

sentence using one of these prefixes to illustrate their meanings. Turn and

talk to explain to your partner how these prefixes change the words they

are attached to. Challenge yourself to use different words from the ones we

discussed in the previous lesson.


 - Remind students that _over–_ means “too much,” _mid–_ means “middle,” and

_under–_ means “below” or “less.”


 - Divide students into pairs. Pass out paper and markers to each pair.

(Alternatively, make sure each pair has a small whiteboard and marker.)

- Tell students that you will read a sentence aloud. The sentence includes a

definition of a word from the previous lesson that has either the prefix _over_ –, _mid_ –,

and _under_ –. Students must work with their partner to write in their best cursive

handwriting the word that matches the meaning given in the sentence in large

letters on paper. Then, you will ask students to hold up the word they wrote when

you say the word “Display.” After, have students turn and talk to a partner to

discuss how the prefix changed the meaning of the word.


- Use the following steps to complete this activity, reading sentences from

the following chart.


**Note:** The chart is shaded in gray to indicate you do not need to write

the information on the board or chart paper but rather use it during oral

Wampanoag approaching
English settlement


You have learned about how the

English colonies were established

and how the colonists lived their











**360**



lives. Throughout this time, the English, Spanish, and French

colonists fought each other over land in North America. They were

land-hungry and clashed over the areas of North America they

wanted for themselves. The Spanish conquistadors had forced

the French colonists out of what is present-day Florida and gained

control of it. They also moved into the areas of southwestern North

America including present-day New Mexico. The French settlers

were colonizing parts of present-day Canada and had also claimed

the Mississippi River valley for France. Whereas some of these

land claims resulted in wars on European soil, other clashes were

beginning to take place in North America.


Unit 9 Colonial America


~~It may be helpful for students if these areas are pointed out on a large~~

~~US map.~~


At the same time, more and more Europeans were coming to the

English colonies and searching for land to settle. They began to

move farther west, away from the coastal areas where people had

first settled. Over time, Native Americans began to realize that there

would be no end to the **influx** of people.


~~What does~~ ~~_influx_~~ ~~mean? (~~ ~~_incoming arrival_~~ ~~)~~


~~How do you think Native Americans were feeling at this time?~~

~~(~~ ~~_Answers may vary._~~ ~~)~~


In 1675, war broke out in New England. After years of friction and

conflict, Wampanoag warriors attacked homesteads and colonists

retaliated.


Chief Metacom, the son of Chief Massasoit [mass-uh-so-it], led a war

party against some English settlers. This turned into an all-out conflict.

Eventually, the English settlers won. Only about four hundred of the

Wampanoag survived, and the settlers took even more of their land.


~~Who was Massasoit? (~~ ~~_the Wampanoag chief who helped the Pilgrims_~~

~~_at Plymouth_~~ ~~)~~

Remind students that
they learned about the
Wampanoag and the first

**Student Reader pages 212—213**
French and Indian War battle scene


As the colonies grew, English

explorers continued west across the

Appalachian Mountains to what is

now the Ohio River Valley. However





this land was not uninhabited either. Native Americans had been

living in this region for a long time; some of them had to move west

away from the eastern regions when the **influx** of settlers arrived.

The French colonists also claimed a few areas of the Ohio Valley.

They had established a good trading partnership with various Native

**tribes** in the area. They didn’t want the English settlers to interfere

with this business relationship.


Lesson 15 “The Road to Revolution, Part I”
**361**


**362**



~~It may be helpful to show the area on a US map. Tell students that~~

~~if an area is uninhabited, it means that no one was living in it. Ask~~

~~students who already inhabited this area. Tell them to listen carefully~~

~~to see if their predictions were correct.~~


Neither Native Americans nor the French colonists wanted English

settlers to build homes upon this land. However, the British Lieutenant

Governor of Virginia, Robert Dinwiddie, wrote to the French military

commander in the Ohio Valley, insisting that the land belonged to

Great Britain and demanding that the French government abandon its

claim to it.


~~Tell students that by this time, England, Scotland, and Wales had~~

~~officially become known as Great Britain.~~


The French military commander considered this request and then

replied: “Non!”


~~What do you suppose that response means? (~~ ~~_No_~~ ~~) Does it sound like~~

~~the French monarchy is going to cooperate?~~


Yet another war broke out in 1754. This war is known as the French

and Indian War, although it was primarily between Great Britain

and France.


~~Why were Native Americans called Indians by the colonists?~~ ~~_(When_~~

~~_Columbus encountered Native peoples in the Bahamas, he thought he_~~

~~_had landed in the East Indies, off the coast of India.)_~~


Fought in the forests of North America, this war went on for a very

long time—almost nine years in all. George Washington and many

other colonists were in favor of the war, hoping to gain more territory,

and fought on the side of the British. The British government also

sent thousands of soldiers across the Atlantic Ocean to fight. There

were Native Americans on both sides of the war, although many of

them tried to stay out of it. Some were pressured into choosing a

side in the conflict and fighting for it, often because the British or

French threatened to cut off trade if they didn’t participate. Many

Native Americans in the region, such as the Huron, fought with the

French. Others, such as the Iroquois, sided with the British.


Unit 9 Colonial America


Two years later, the war over the colonial territory in North America

spread to other parts of the world where France and Great Britain

competed for land, such as Europe, the West Indies, and India. This

phase of the war is known as the Seven Years War in Great Britain.







**Student Reader pages 214—215**
King George III before Parliament;
Proclamation being read


Eventually, after much conflict, the

British captured the French-controlled

city of Quebec, Canada. The capture





of Quebec in 1759 was a turning point for the British, who eventually

won the war. In 1763, the war was over, but this was the beginning of

the end for French fortune in North America.


Although the French and the British signed a peace treaty, some

Native Americans continued to fight for their land. They were led by

Chief Pontiac of the Ottawa tribe, and so their fight became known

as “Pontiac’s Rebellion.” But these attempts actually involved a vast

network of at least thirteen Native American tribes which united

together around protecting their people. Chief Pontiac and the Native

American tribes were successful. The British soon realized that it

would be very difficult and very expensive to try to defeat them.

As a result, the British Parliament and King George III decided that

settlers should not live on land west of the Appalachian Mountains. In

1763, King George issued a proclamation forbidding it.


Fighting a war for many years is a very expensive thing to do. When it

was over, the British Parliament realized that they had spent a great

deal of money. Britain was in financial trouble, and someone had to

help get Britain out of it. That someone was the 13 colonies.


The prime minister of Great Britain at the end of the French and

Indian War was a man named George Grenville. Grenville was asked

to come up with a plan to pay off Britain’s **debt** . He thought long

and hard about this and did indeed come up with a plan. “How about


Lesson 15 “The Road to Revolution, Part I”
**363**


**taxing** the colonists?” he thought to himself. “After all, Great Britain

fought the war to defend the colonists against the French and Native

Americans!” Grenville presented his plan to King George III and

Parliament. King George and most members of the British parliament

agreed that it was a great plan.


~~If the prime minister wanted to tax the colonists, what does that~~

~~mean? (~~ ~~_He wanted them to pay a fee to Great Britain.)_~~



Challenge


Have students make a list
of items that we have to
pay taxes on today.
What does that tax
money pay for?


**364**







**Student Reader pages 216—217**
American colonists read the Stamp Act


In 1764, the British Parliament passed

the Sugar Act. This law placed a tax on

foreign sugar and molasses. By making

foreign sugar and molasses more





expensive, the colonists were being forced to buy these goods from the

British producers in the West Indies. However, this act did not just include

sugar; it also included cloth, coffee, and silk. The colonists were now

taxed if they chose to buy less expensive products from other nations.


Then in 1765, the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act. The Stamp

Act stated that all printed materials produced in the colonies would be

taxed. Newspapers, magazines, legal documents, and—believe it or not—

even a deck of playing cards would cost more. People were required to

buy a stamp and place it on the paper item they had purchased.


~~Explain that the Stamp Act should not be confused with postage~~

~~stamps that are purchased and attached to letters to be mailed.~~


In the same year, the Quartering Act was passed by the British

Parliament. This meant that colonists had to help provide quarters,

or temporary places to live, for the British soldiers stationed in the

colonies. The colonists also had to provide supplies, such as food,

bedding, candles, and firewood.


For many years, the colonists had handled their own affairs. Now,

members of a government three thousand miles away had voted

to tax the colonists. The colonists were not allowed to vote for

these British leaders, so they felt their views and thoughts were not

represented in the British government.


Unit 9 Colonial America


Check for Understanding


Do a quick Whip-Around activity where students supply one word to
describe how the colonists were feeling. Have everyone stand up. Go
around the room, and as each student gives one word, have that student
sit down. Continue until all students are sitting down.


Many colonists believed that it was unfair that they had to pay taxes

but did not have **representation** in the British Parliament.


The British responded that members of Parliament considered the

interests of the entire empire and not simply the areas they represented.


Although most people had accepted the Sugar Act and the

Quartering Act, they were not prepared to accept the Stamp Act

without a fight.


Some **outspoken** colonists began to suggest that they should not

pay it. They cried, “No taxation without **representation** !”


~~Explain that “No taxation without representation!” will become a~~

~~rallying cry for the colonists as they move toward revolution and~~

~~that they will hear more about that in the next Read-Aloud.~~


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** Why were conflicts increasing among the Spanish, French,

and English colonists?

**Lesson 15: The Road to Revolution, Part I**
Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will identify object pronouns in sentences.


~~**TEKS 3.11.D.vii**~~



20M



**368**



~~**GRAMMAR: OBJECT PRONOUNS AND PRONOUN ANTECEDENTS (20 MIN.)**~~


**Introducing Object Pronoun and Pronoun Antecedents**


 - Direct students’ attention to the object pronouns poster and the pronouns and

pronoun antecedent poster you displayed in advance.


Object Pronouns


**Object pronouns** take the place of nouns. Object pronouns come after

action verbs, such as _throw, tell,_ and _say_, and prepositions, such as _to_, _at_,

_for_, _of_, _in_, _from_, and _with_ . Singular object pronouns are _me_, _you_, _him_, _her_,

and _it_ . Plural object pronouns are _us_, _you_, and _them_ .


Pronouns and Pronoun Antecedents


**Pronouns** are words that take the place of nouns.


**Pronoun antecedents** are the words to which the pronouns refer.

Pronouns and their antecedents must agree in number and gender.


 - Remind students that in a previous lesson, you reviewed subject pronouns and

the nouns they refer to (their antecedents). Tell students that today, they will

discover that pronouns can serve as objects in sentences, meaning that they

follow action verbs or the words listed on the poster.


 - Read the following sets of sentences to students, and have them find the

pronouns in each set.


Mother called Brad to come in. Mother wanted him to have lunch. ( _him_ )


The teacher wanted Wanda to try harder on spelling assessments. The

teacher hoped studying in class today would help her. ( _her_ )


 - Ask, “In the first set of sentences, does the pronoun _him_ come after an action

verb?” (yes, _wanted_ )


**TEKS 3.11.D.vii** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including: pronouns, including subjective, objective, and
possessivecases.


Unit 9 Colonial America


- Ask, “To whom does the pronoun _him_ refer?” (Brad)


- Ask, “In the second set of sentences, does the pronoun _her_ come after an

action verb?” (yes, _hoped_ )


- Ask, “To whom does the pronoun _her_ refer?” (Wanda)


- Point out that in each set of sentences, the pronouns agree with the nouns

they refer to (their antecedents) in number and gender; both are singular as

the first refers to a boy and the second refers to a girl.


- Read the following sentences, and ask students to choose the correct pronoun.


1. I hope that doorbell is not our silly neighbors! I am not ready to see

today. ( _they_ or _them_ : _them_ because the pronoun comes after the action verb,

and _them_ is an object pronoun)


2. Mother left my brother and me at home alone. She trusts to behave

when she’s gone. ( _we_ or _us_ : _us_ because the pronoun comes after the action

verb, and _us_ is an object pronoun)


3. Carrie’s dad is a kind man. He always treats well. ( _she_ or _her_ ; _her_ because

the pronoun comes after the action verb, and _her_ is an object pronoun)


4. Mrs. Sandon taught our class multiplication. Now, we all understand

and can multiply easily. ( _it_, _you_ : _it_ because the pronoun comes after the

action verb, and _it_ is an object pronoun)


5. I put a leash on my dog to go for a walk. Now, he is walking right beside .

( _me_ or _I_ : _me_ because the pronoun comes after the action verb and _me_ is

an object pronoun)


6. Our mother went to visit her parents out of state. She had some presents for

( _them_ or _they_ : _them_ because the pronoun comes after the action

verb, and _them_ is an object pronoun) When she arrived, she said, “These

presents are for .” ( _me_ or _you_ : _you_ because _you_ refers to the person

spoken to)


7. Connie’s brother told her to look the word up in the dictionary. She searched

through the pages and finally exclaimed, “I found !” ( _them_ or _it_ : _it_

because both _word_ and _it_ are singular)

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


- Make sure that you and your students each have a copy of _Living in_

_Colonial America_ .

- Have students go to the Table of Contents, locate Chapter 21 “Road to

Revolution, Part II”, and go to the first page of the chapter.

- Ask students to recall some of the events in Chapter 20 “The Road to

Revolution, Part I” that led to the colonists becoming more outspoken.


» The multiple wars caused Britain to be in a financial crisis, and so they started

taxing the colonists on certain items; laws were passed that colonists had to


Unit 9 Colonial America


quarter soldiers in their homes; they were not allowed to vote for British leaders,

so they felt that they were not represented in British government.


- Ask students, “What were the three acts passed by British Parliament that

taxed the colonists?”


» Sugar Act, Stamp Act, and Quartering Act


- Have students describe the Stamp Act.


» It was a tax on all printed materials that required a stamp be put on the material to

show that the tax had been paid.


~~**READ-ALOUD: “THE ROAD TO REVOLUTION, PART II” (20 MIN.)**~~



**Student Reader pages 218—219**
Patrick Henry before the House of
Burgesses speaking against tax


As you have heard, the colonists were

in strong opposition to the taxes Great

Britain kept heaping on them. Their









famous words were, “No taxation without **representation** !”


~~Who remembers what this saying means?~~


One man in particular, Patrick Henry, began to speak up. Patrick

Henry was a Virginia lawyer. In Williamsburg, Virginia, he stood before

the House of Burgesses and spoke out against the king and the new

tax. Patrick Henry stated that only colonial governments should have

the power to introduce new taxes in the colonies.


~~Explain that the House of Burgesses was the assembly of~~

~~representatives in colonial Virginia.~~


In 1765, the twenty-seven elected leaders of nine colonies made their

way to New York. They met to discuss what could be done about the

Stamp Act. This meeting became known as the Stamp Act Congress.

Members of the Congress informed the British Parliament that this

tax was **unjust** .


~~Not all the colonies sent representatives. Virginia, New Hampshire,~~

~~North Carolina, and Georgia did not.~~



Support


Explain that _repeal_ means
to withdraw or take back.



Lesson 16 “The Road to Revolution, Part II”
**375**


Another **outspoken** leader at this time was a man named Samuel

Adams from Massachusetts. He organized a group of people who

became known as the Sons of Liberty. These men protested in the

streets, burned the stamps, and **threatened** the agents whose job it was

to collect the taxes. It soon became impossible to impose the Stamp

Act. And so in 1766, the British Parliament was forced to repeal it. When

the colonists heard this news, they celebrated their victory.



**Student Reader pages 220—221**
Boston Massacre; Crispus Attucks


Members of Parliament were not

happy. King George III insisted

that it was Britain’s right to tax the

colonies. A new plan was needed.











**376**



This time, a man named Charles Townshend had another idea. They

would put a tax on items that they knew the colonists really needed.

These items—which were used daily in colonial times to make many

things—included paint, paper, glass, lead, tea, wool, and silk.


In response, the colonists decided to **boycott** these items from Britain.

They began to make their own products. Colonists purchased tea from

other sources or drank “liberty tea” made from herbs and berries.

Many women even began making their own cloth. This hurt British

manufacturers, and before long, this tax was also removed—that is, all

except for the tax on tea. So, the colonists’ **boycott** of British

tea continued.


Alarmed by the level of protests, Britain sent troops to the colonies.

They arrived in Boston **Harbor** in 1768. The colonists did not like

the presence of British soldiers, especially because the soldiers had

been sent to control them. **Tension** between the colonists and Britain

continued to grow.


~~What does tension mean? (~~ ~~_strong feelings of distress_~~ ~~) What do you think~~

~~was causing the most amount of tension? (~~ ~~_Answers may vary but could_~~

~~_include taxes on items they need or the presence of British soldiers_~~ ~~.)~~


Unit 9 Colonial America


In 1770, a scuffle, or brief fight, broke out in Boston between British

soldiers and a group of colonists. In the confusion, British soldiers

fired their guns into the crowd and killed five colonists, injuring six

others. The first to die was a man named Crispus Attucks. People

were horrified. The soldiers were immediately arrested. This terrible

event became known as the Boston Massacre. The relationship

between the colonists and Britain was becoming much worse.


~~Explain that historians believe that Crispus Attucks escaped~~

~~enslavement. After his death, he was called a hero for standing up for~~

~~what he believed in.~~



**Student Reader pages 222—223**
Boston Tea Party


It would not be fair to say that tea

caused the American Revolution, but

it played a part. The colonists were still

refusing to buy tea from Britain. And









King George and his government were refusing to listen to the colonists.

In 1773, the British Parliament introduced a new law called the Tea Act.

This time, they said that the British East India Company would no longer

have to pay the tax on tea, but colonial merchants would still have to pay

the tax. That would give the British company an unfair advantage over

the colonial merchants with whom they were competing.


The colonists responded that, not only did they not want this tea,

they didn’t want trade ships bringing it into the colonies either. In

other words, they would give up drinking British tea altogether.


In 1773, three British trade ships loaded with tea appeared in the

Boston **Harbor** . The Sons of Liberty took action. Wearing elements of

Native American war clothing, they threw all of the tea into the water!

This event became known as the Boston Tea Party.


~~It is important to point out that the colonists weren’t trying to~~

~~disguise themselves as Native Americans to try to fool the British.~~


Lesson 16 “The Road to Revolution, Part II”
**377**


~~Historians believe the colonists were inspired by the tradition of Native~~

~~American pride and were dressed in Native American-style war clothing~~

~~to make a statement about being prepared for battle.~~


Now the king was really mad. You could say the colonists’ “actions

spoke louder than their words.” The British government decided

to punish this **colony** . A British general was placed in control of

Massachusetts. Boston **Harbor** was closed, and more British soldiers

were sent to Boston. With the port closed, many colonial businesses

began to suffer. The colonists called these recent British decisions the

Intolerable Acts because they were not willing to put up with them.


~~Tell students that if something is~~ ~~_intolerable_~~ ~~, it means it is not accepted.~~



**Student Reader pages 224—225**
Founding Fathers: Washington, Adams,
Jefferson, Madison, Franklin, Hancock


Rather than back down, the colonists

began to join together. Many colonists

were even more convinced now that









**378**



the British did not understand them or care about them.


Colonists were now daring to think about, and talk about, establishing

their **independence** from England and becoming their own nation. Those

who wanted to become independent, or free, of England were called

Patriots. People still loyal to England and the king were known as Loyalists.


~~What does independence mean? (~~ ~~_freedom from the control or_~~

~~_reliance upon someone or something_~~ ~~)~~


Check for Understanding


Have students create the following analogy: The colonists wanting to
become independent from England would be like wanting freedom
from . Have students share their responses orally. If students
have misconceptions, provide examples, and list ways the colonists were
dependent on England.


Unit 9 Colonial America


It was clear that the colonists’ relationship with Britain was changing,

and elected leaders of the colonies had to decide what to do. George

Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Benjamin

Franklin, John Hancock, and other leaders came together for a gathering

in Philadelphia known as the First Continental Congress.


~~Which of these men’s names sound familiar to you? What do you~~

~~know about them? (~~ ~~_Answers will vary_~~ ~~.) Tell students that the first four~~

~~men were the first US presidents, and they are all known today as~~

~~our country’s “Founding Fathers” for their part in establishing~~

~~America’s~~ ~~**independence**~~ ~~.~~









**Student Reader pages 225—226**
Paul Revere’s Ride


In this meeting, the leaders voted to

end all trade with Britain until Britain

repealed the Intolerable Acts. Most

people still hoped that these **issues**





could be resolved peacefully. However, it was decided that each **colony**

should begin to store weapons and train men for war.


On April 18, 1775, British soldiers were given information about

colonial weapons that had been secretly stored in a town called

Concord, about 20 miles from Boston. The soldiers were ordered to

seize the weapons and destroy them. The British soldiers began to

march toward Concord. A colonist named Paul Revere rode through

the night to inform his fellow Patriots that the British were coming.


Perhaps you are familiar with this first part of a famous poem called

“Paul Revere’s Ride” by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, based on this

historic event:


_Listen, my children, and you shall hear_


_Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,_


_On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five:_


Lesson 16 “The Road to Revolution, Part II”
**379**


_Hardly a man is now alive_


_Who remembers that famous day and year._


_He said to his friend, “If the British march_


_By land or sea from the town to-night,_


_Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch_


_Of the North Church tower as a signal-light,_


_One, if by land, and two, if by sea;_


_And I on the opposite shore will be . . .”_


Paul Revere saw the signal of two lanterns lit by his friend in the

church tower. That meant the British were coming by sea, so he rode

all night to Concord to warn the colonists. Although Paul Revere was

captured, the colonial soldiers, called Minutemen, were warned by

two other men who rode with Revere: William Dawes and Samuel

Prescott. This allowed them to prepare for the arrival of the British.











**Student Reader pages 227—228**
Declaration of Independence;
the Stars and Stripes colonial flag


The very first shots of the American

Revolution were fired in Lexington on

April 19, 1775, as the British soldiers

were on their way to Concord.



**380**



~~This was later known as “the shot heard round the world” in a famous~~

~~poem written by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Why do you think it was~~

~~called that? (~~ ~~_It was the start of the American Revolution; there was a_~~

~~_far-reaching impact across the world.)_~~


Historians are not certain who fired the first shot. Several Minutemen

died in this exchange of fire. The British soldiers continued their

march toward Concord. However, when they got there, the weapons

were nowhere to be found.


Unit 9 Colonial America


The historic ride of Paul Revere and others had warned the colonists

in time for them to move their weapons. The British began to retreat.

As they did, they were fired upon by Minutemen. Many British

soldiers were killed.


~~What does it mean that the British began to retreat? (~~ ~~_They began to_~~

~~_pull back._~~ ~~)~~


A second gathering of leaders from each colony was called in the

city of Philadelphia, which would later become the first capital of the

United States.


~~Where is the capital of the United States today? (~~ ~~_Washington, D.C._~~ ~~)~~


Shortly before this meeting, Patrick Henry had uttered these famous

words: “I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give

me liberty or give me death!”


At this Second Continental Congress, George Washington was chosen

to be the Commander-in-Chief in charge of an army that did not yet fully

exist, but which the leaders anticipated they would soon need. During

this time, many letters and petitions were sent to King George. Among

them was the Declaration of **Independence**, primarily penned by

Thomas Jefferson and approved by the Founding Fathers on July 4, 1776.


King George responded by ignoring the colonists’ requests and

sending more British soldiers to the colonies. The long and difficult

battle for American **independence** had begun.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Who was Patrick Henry, and what is the quote he is famous for today?


» He was a lawyer from Virginia. The quote is “Give me liberty or give me death!”


2. **Literal.** What is the name of the group that Samuel Adams organized to protest

the British taxes and rules?


» The Sons of Liberty


3. **Literal.** Why did colonists boycott products from Britain, such as tea, wool,

paper, and silk?

In 1773, three British trade ships loaded with tea appeared in the Boston

Harbor. The Sons of Liberty took action. Wearing elements of Native

American war clothing, they threw all of the tea into the water!


The very first shots of the American Revolution (or the shot heard round

the world) were fired in Lexington on April 19, 1775, as the British soldiers

were on their way to Concord.


Unit 9 Colonial America


- Ask students what actions performed in these excerpts “spoke” or

delivered a message.


» First action—The colonists threw the tea into the water to send the message to

England that they would not tolerate unjust taxes. This action was more effective

in getting the king’s attention than their words of protest had been.


» Second action—The “shot heard round the world” was the first shot fired that

started the American Revolution. It sent the message to the world that there

around the world and throughout history.


- Ask students whether they ever faced a situation in which someone’s actions

made an impression on them more powerfully than any words that could

have been said. You may wish to discuss the effects of certain actions in a

classroom that “speak” loudly. Give students an opportunity to share their

experiences, and encourage them to use the saying.

~~**WRITING THE NEXT CHAPTER: PRESENTING (45 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.1.A**~~


 - Have the writing groups from Lesson 15 come together.

 - Remind students that one of the roles in their group was the Reader. Explain

that that person will be reading the drafts of the chapter aloud to the class.

 - Have students turn to Activity Page 16.3.

 - Tell students that while each of the groups are presenting their chapter, they

will be listening carefully and generating a question they can ask that group.

 - Explain that everyone needs to write one question for each group, and some

students will be asking that group their question after they are done reading.

 - Tell the groups that the Readers are not expected to answer all the

questions by themselves; the groups can confer on an answer before the

Reader responds.


**TEKS 3.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments; **TEKS 3.1.C** Speak
coherently about the topic under discussion, employing eye contact, speaking rate, volume, enunciation, and the conventions

- Remind students that questions are meant to clarify or give new information,

not to criticize.

- Brainstorm with students some possible types of questions they may ask.

They may include:


   - Why did you choose that character to write about?


   - What was the hardest part of writing the chapter?


   - How did you decide that your chapter would be funny (or dramatic, or

sad, etc.)


   - What do you think happened next?




- Why did your character



?




- Have each group read their chapter. After each group has finished, call one

or two volunteers to read their questions to the group. The Reader can confer

with the group before answering.

- Collect Activity Page 16.3 when all the groups have finished answering questions.


~~**WRAP-UP**~~


- Have students write a brief reflection on the shared writing experience. What

went well? What needs to be improved? Would they like to do a shared writing

activity again?

~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS**~~


**Unit 9, Lesson 16**


 - Students are likely to make the following errors:


    - For ‘ou’, students may write ‘ow’


    - For ‘ow’, students may write ‘ou’


 - While the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be aware
that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful
to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis
chart. For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning

consonants?


 - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


 - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization

and punctuation.

_**Administration Instructions for Fluency Assessment**_


- Turn to the Student Copy of “An Account of Pennsylvania” that comes at the

end of this lesson. This is the text the student will read aloud. Reuse this copy

for each assessment.


- Tell student to tear out Activity Page 17.2 “An Account of Pennsylvania” and the

W.C.P.M. Calculation Worksheet for you to create a running record as you listen

to each student read orally.


- Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. As

student reads aloud, make a running record on the Recording Copy using the

following guidelines:

|Words read correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion was<br>made. If you have time, write down the word that was<br>inserted.|
|**Words read incorrectly**|Write an “X” above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-corrected errors**|Replace original error mark with an “SC.”|
|**Teacher-supplied words**|Write a “T” above the word (counts as an error).|



- When one minute has elapsed, draw a vertical line on the Recording Copy

to mark where the student was in the text at that point. Allow the student to

finish reading the selection aloud.


- Write down the student’s reading time in minutes and seconds. Record

whether the time was Elapsed Time (student did not finish) or Finished Time.


- You may also assess comprehension by asking students to answer the

following questions:


1. **Literal.** Which colony did Thomas describe? (Pennsylvania)


2. **Literal.** Did he say it was a good place to be a farmer? Why or why not? (Yes,

the land is cheap and corn grows well)


3. **Literal.** According to Thomas, do laborers make better wages in

Pennsylvania or in England? (in Pennsylvania)


4. **Literal.** What are some of the animals Thomas described? (panthers, bears,

foxes, muskrats, hares, raccoons, red deer, opossum, flying squirrels, swans,

ducks, geese, turkeys, eagles, pheasants)

**An Account of Pennsylvania**


In 1681, Gabriel Thomas left his home in Wales. He sailed to 12


America and settled in Pennsylvania. At the time, Pennsylvania was a 23


new colony. It had been set up by the Quaker William Penn. Thomas 36


went there partly because he was a Quaker, too. 45


Thomas lived in Pennsylvania for 16 years. In 1697, he sailed back to 58


Europe. The next year, he published a book. It was called _An Account of_ 72


_Pennsylvania_ . Here are some of the details Thomas reported in his book. 84


Philadelphia is the main city of Pennsylvania. It sits between two 95


rivers. One is the Schuylkill; the other is the great Delaware. Ships may 108


come to the city by either of these two rivers. 118


The air in Pennsylvania is very pleasant and wholesome. The sky 129


is rarely cloudy. Winters are a little colder than in England and Wales. 142


Summers are a little hotter. The earth is very fertile and good for farming. 156


In Pennsylvania, land is cheap. A man can buy 100 acres of land for 170


ten or fifteen pounds. 174


Corn grows well there. Most years the farmers get twenty to thirty 186


bushels of corn for each bushel they plant. 194


Wages are high. A poor man can make three times as much as he 208


would make in England. A carpenter can make five or six shillings a day. 222


Unit 9 Colonial America


Student Name Date


A shoemaker can get two shillings for a pair of shoes. A potter can get 237


sixteen pence for a pot, which may be bought in England for four pence. 251


Women can earn good wages there as well. There are not many 263


women there. So seamstresses are well paid. 270


Pennsylvania is open to all. The Church of England and the Quakers 282


have equal shares in government. There is no persecution for religion. 293


There are many sorts of wild animals in Pennsylvania. There are 304


panthers, bears, and foxes. 308


There are muskrats, hares, and raccoons. You can hunt in the 319


forests without getting special permission. 324


There are many red deer. I once bought a large one from the Native 338


Americans for two gills of gunpowder. These deer make excellent food. 349


The opossum is a strange creature. She has a pouch to hold her 362


young. She keeps them there, safe from all dangers. 371


They also have flying squirrels. The flying squirrel has flaps of skin 383


that are like wings. It is much lighter than a common squirrel. I have 397


seen them fly from one tree to another. But how long they can stay in 412


the air is not known. 417


There are many birds in Pennsylvania, too. They have swans, ducks, 428

and geese. They also have turkeys, eagles, and pheasants. 437


Reader, what I have written here is not a fiction, flam, or whim. It is 452


all true. I was an eyewitness to it all. For I went to Pennsylvania in the 468


first ship that sailed there, in the year 1681. 477

Pausing Point 2


Note to Teacher


By the end of this unit about Colonial America, students have learned about

the earliest settlements, their successes and failures, the newly growing

cities and colonies, and the road to American independence. Take this time

to review, remediate and/or enrich the content of Unit 9.


You may do the activities in any order or combination, using whole class or

small groups to meet the needs of the students.


~~**CORE CONTENT UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


 - Recall that John Cabot and Henry Hudson had previously explored North

America for England and the Netherlands, respectively.


 - Explain why the Middle Colonies were called “the breadbasket”.


 - Explain that the Lower Counties of Pennsylvania became the colony of Delaware.


 - Provide reasons why the Middle Atlantic became one of the fastest growing

regions in colonial America.


 - Describe everyday life in the colonies.


 - Compare and contrast colonial life with present day.


 - Describe the many conflicts among the French, English, and Native Americans.


 - Describe why the colonists began to feel less and less like Europeans.


 - Describe some of the events that led to the American Revolution.


 - Explain the statements “no taxation without representation”; “one, if by land,

and two, if by sea”; “the shot heard round the world”; and “Give me liberty, or

give me death!”


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Image Review**


Materials: Digital Images from Lessons 9–16


 - Project the Digital Images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students retell

the Read-Aloud using the images.


Unit 9 Colonial America


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: chart paper or board


 - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _independence_ .

Have them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word.

Record their responses on chart paper or a whiteboard for reference.


**Multiple-Meaning Word Activity:** _**Taxing**_


Materials: chart paper or board; images depicting the various meanings of

the word _taxing_


1. In the Read-Aloud, you heard the word _taxing_ in the sentence, “‘How about

taxing the colonists?’ [George Grenville] thought to himself.” Remember,

Grenville was the prime minister of Britain who was trying to find a way for

the king to come up with money to pay for the French and Indian War. The

king liked this idea and began taxing the colonists. The word _taxing_ here is a

verb, and it means demanding people to pay the government extra money

for goods purchased or money earned. This verb can also have the forms

tax, taxes, and taxed, such as in this example: “The king unfairly taxed the

colonists.”


2. The word _taxing_ is based on the root word _tax_, which is a noun to mean

money that must be paid. The noun _tax_ can also be plural: taxes. For

example, “We pay taxes every year to the IRS, or Internal Revenue Service.”


3. _Taxing_ can also be an adjective to mean severely exhausting and difficult.

Remind students about the starving time in Jamestown. Explain to them that

the word _taxing_ could be used to describe the starving time and how difficult

it was for the colonists. For example, you might say, “The winter of 1609 to

1610 in Jamestown was a very taxing time for the colonists.” Another example

could be “Traveling all the way across the Atlantic with little food and few

supplies was very taxing for the settlers.”


4. Now with your neighbor, make a sentence for each meaning of _taxing_, also

using the forms _tax_, _taxes_, and _taxed_ . Remember to be as descriptive as

possible and use complete sentences. I will call on some of you to share your

sentences. (Call on a few student pairs to share one or all of their sentences.

Have them point to the image that relates to each use of taxing. You may also

wish to have some students identify the part of speech.)


5. You may wish to show students images depicting the various meanings of

the word _taxing_ .

New Jersey for England. Who am I? (the Duke of York)


- I am the nickname given to the Middle Atlantic colonies because they

produced so much wheat and flour. What am I? (“the breadbasket”)

the students will turn to their partners, cover up what they read, and try to

remember and retell what they read. Their partner will listen and fill in any

missing information. For the next paragraph, the partners can switch roles

remembering and retelling. Continue going back and forth until the end of

the chapter.


**Write a Letter**


Materials: paper, pencil

Philadelphia, what would it be like?” Have students draw a map showing how

their city would look and label important sites. Make sure they give it a name.

Would it have a nickname, like “The City of Brotherly Love”?


**A Ship by Any Other Name**


Materials: paper, pencil


 - Ask students what role ships played in the establishment of the English

colonies. Guide students to discuss the importance of ships in allowing people

to journey across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas—not only the English

colonists, but also the European explorers they have heard about. Discuss

others whose lives were influenced by ships, such as the pirate buccaneers,

trade merchants, English navy, fishermen, and shipbuilders. Remind

students that shipbuilding was a crucial part of the economy of the New

England colonies.


- Ask students to list some of the names of the ships they have heard about

during the unit. Review the people, events, and significant dates surrounding

the ships. (Captain Newport and his men sailed to Jamestown in 1606 on the

_Discovery_, _Susan Constant_, and _Godspeed_ and arrived about five months later

in 1607. Later, the _Patience_ and _Deliverance_ were sent to Jamestown colony

laden with supplies, but by the time they arrived—and they barely made

it—the ships were almost out of supplies. The Pilgrims and others sailed to

Plymouth in 1620 on the _Mayflower_ . William Penn sailed to Pennsylvania on

the _Welcome_ .)


- Ask students to think about what type of ship they would like to design and/

or command as a captain. Have them write a paragraph about their ship,

including its name and the reason for its name, its purpose and/or destination,

what it looks like, and what types of people would travel on it. Have students

illustrate their ship. Allow a few students to share their writing and drawings

with the class.

groups: the English (John Cabot, Charles II, Duke of York, and the English

colonists); the Dutch (Henry Hudson, Peter Stuyvesant, and the early Dutch

settlers); and Native Americans, including the Munsee. Place students in three

groups to discuss the following about each key person:

Unit 9 Colonial America


**Unit 9 Lesson 1|**
**Life on Roanoke Island**









The October sun was low behind the trees as I rose from the

rough earth of the garden. I dusted off my skirt and wobbled

a bit as I stooped for my basket. There was not enough in it. I

had planted long rows of herbs and beans, just as I would have

in England, but they had not grown well on this island, with its

raw sea winds. This would be a feeble harvest.


Father joined me as I walked back to the log hut. “How are you,

Eleanor?” he asked.







“I am well,” I said. “Just hungry.” I was always hungry. All of us were. All summer, we had caught

fish, but now the fish had moved to warmer waters. On the mainland, when we could reach it,

we could gather nuts. But for two weeks now, the waters had been too rough to allow a crossing.


“At least you have reason to be hungry,” said Father, smiling at the spherical curve of my belly.

“Some of the men here . . . they complain of hunger, but they do scarcely any work.” His voice

sounded bitter. Leading our group had been difficult for him. Some who wished to occupy the

new land could not work together to feed themselves. Since April, he had been speaking of the

need to secure a food supply. Now, as we gathered the poor harvests, starvation seemed to

loom over us.


At the door of the hut, my husband raised his hand in greeting. “I have a surprise, Eleanor,” he

said. He lifted a large basket. “Beans! Two Powhatan were on the east shore earlier, seeking

trade.” The Powhatan could cross to and from the mainland even when we could not. They used

low boats that cut smoothly through the water.


“What did you trade with them?” I asked.


He looked sheepish. “My coat,” he said. “It’s no matter. We must be able to provide for you and

the baby.”


Father shook his head in disapproval. “If you two fear starvation—you, who work so much—then

I fear for the rest of the group. I will have to sail back to England for more supplies.”


“Perhaps we can trade more,” I began, but my father cut me off.


“We have nothing left to trade,” he said. “We need flour and oats. We need more seeds—perhaps

different seeds—and fruit tree saplings to make orchards. And you need a coat. The winter will

only get colder. Eleanor,” he added suddenly, “you should sail back with me. The baby could be

born in England.”


“I want to stay here,” I said. “It will be tougher, but we should be together.”

Father sighed. “You’re free to choose, of course.”


All at once, I imagined what this place might be like after he had left. I had never seen the beach

without the great sailing ship at anchor. It had always seemed to promise us that we would be

safe. When it was gone, our isolation would feel absolute.

**Unit 9 Lesson 6|**
**A Day in Anna’s Life in Maryland**





“Anna! Mercy on me, haven’t you finished the chores yet?”


“I’ve _almost_ finished,” I said, hoping my voice didn’t betray

how guilty I felt. As I was gathering the eggs from the

henhouse, I saw a beautiful orange and black bird with a white

stripe on its wing. I had never seen that kind of bird before. I

stopped to enjoy it—only for a moment!—as it chittered and

peeped. Then, before I knew it, the sun was higher in the sky,

and Mama was waiting in the doorway, looking annoyed.





“You’ve been avoiding work long enough, young lady. I want you to run down to the shore and

find some clams and oysters.”


“Yes, Mama,” I replied, trying to disguise my joy. I had thought I was going to have to sit quietly

inside and practice my embroidery—needlepoint, to be more specific. I do not like needlepoint.

You make tiny stitch after tiny stitch, your neck hurts, your eyes squinch up, and you poke your

fingers with the needle—all for a disappointing scrap of fabric. I would far rather go oystering on

the shore.


I grabbed my basket and hurried through the streets. The streets really are streets now, full

of people, horses, and carts. A few years ago, they were just stretches of soil and grass. But

now this is becoming what Papa calls “a proper town.” There are stores, workshops, and three

different churches. People have begun to make the voyage here because Maryland allowed

people to practice different kinds of Christianity. That seems to be rare, for some reason I can’t

understand, since we all get to make our own choices.


I came over the hill, and all at once the bay spread out before me—teal, turquoise, and royal

blue. I breathed in the clean salty smell of the ocean. I stood poised at the top of the hill, with

the wind blowing in my face. I love the ocean. It’s always changing, always shifting with the wind

or the sky, and yet always the same.


Another orange and black bird darted ahead of me. It perched on a nodding bit of seagrass, as

though to remind me not to become distracted. I sighed and hurried down to the dunes.

**William Penn’s Dream Comes True**





William read through the letter three times and then set

it down on his desk. Though it described exactly what he

had been promised, he didn’t believe it. Doubt crept in. He

slouched in his chair and read it again. It astounded him

that it was all there: the grant of land in North America, the

boundaries, the charming name “Penn’s Sylvania,” the royal

seal.


For years, he had cherished a vision of a town founded in true





**420**



equality. It would have wide, serene streets laid out on a grid, shaded by towering trees. All men

and women would be empowered to speak up. All religious faiths would be allowed. During the

long, lonely months when he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, he had occupied himself

with these dreams and plans. Now, at last, those dreams could become real.


What to do first? There were many people who needed to be told and accounts that needed

to be managed. Perhaps he should write to his friend and counselor, Thomas. Thomas was

another Quaker who shared William’s belief in equality. He would help bring people of different

backgrounds to the new colony. However, when William started to talk about stone foundations

and grids, Thomas tended to smile and lose interest.


There was another person who would be involved—very closely, William hoped. Miss Springett

had waited for about four years. Even at the announcement of his arrest, she had remained true

to him. Now, at last, they could be married.


But William set that letter aside too. The first people he needed to talk to were the ones who

would be most affected—the ones who lived on the land now. Without their agreement, his

plans would sour. William knew what he needed to do. He began to plan his voyage. Soon, he

would be bound for America.
