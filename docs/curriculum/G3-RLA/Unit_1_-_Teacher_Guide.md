Introduction


~~**CLASSIC TALES: THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the _Classic Tales:_
_The Wind in the Willows_ unit. This unit contains 15 lessons. Each lesson will require a total of 120
minutes. Lessons 1–5 are Back-to-School lessons where you will review key Foundational Skills
and reread a few stories from Grade 2. Lessons 6–10 contain the Beginning-of-Year Benchmark
assessments, along with specific scoring information for appropriate placement.


This unit introduces students to several classic tales. During the Read-Aloud portion of the lessons,
students will be listening to and discussing _The Wind in the Willows_, a classic tale written by Kenneth
Grahame. Although this is a modified version of the story, it contains many instances of British
language that you will be discussing with your students. The Reader for this unit contains several
other classic tales, as outlined in the section below.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS**~~


**Reading**


Each unit in Grade 3 includes decodable reading passages to support reading instruction. Decodable
passages are short literary or informational texts that incorporate the decoding skills students
learn in the Texas Elementary Literacy Program; the texts build upon the reading instruction and
the decoding skills taught throughout the unit. Each decodable passage corresponds to specific
lessons in each unit and connects to the instructional reading material for each of those lessons. In
addition to decodable words in each passage, five skill words are highlighted for students to practice
the skill before reading the passage. Decodable passages can also be used to reinforce automaticity,
accuracy, and fluency for students who would benefit from additional instruction or practice.
These materials may be used during small-group instruction, partner work, or independent reading
practice after the lesson is taught or during Pausing Points.


The Reader for this unit, _Classic Tales_, contains selections from two different classic tales, “Aladdin
and the Wonderful Lamp” and “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” Additional enrichment chapters
retelling parts of _The Wind in the Willows_ are also included at the end of the Reader for use at the
teacher’s discretion. Students will be given opportunities throughout the unit to practice reading
with partners and independently, as well as to demonstrate Read-Aloud fluency.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



**Spelling**


Explicit spelling lessons do not begin until Unit 2.
**Grammar**


Explicit grammar lessons do not begin until Unit 2.
**Morphology**


Explicit morphology lessons do not begin until Unit 2.


~~**WHY CLASSIC TALES ARE IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will expose students to classic children’s stories that use rich language and introduce
students to a variety of vocabulary words. Students will be enchanted by descriptive paragraphs
and memorable characters as they explore interesting themes and discuss character traits. As they
go on adventures with these characters, instruction will reinforce understanding of the elements of
fictional narratives, including dialogue, narration, characters, plot, and setting. Students will also
discuss the literary tools of personification, perspective, and point-of-view, as well as the themes
of friendship, loyalty, hospitality, responsibility, and irresponsibility. For more information about
the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the
Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for
students to build content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class
discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Culture
and Geography from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade level
Social Studies instruction.


**Note to Teacher**


Portions of this unit refer to “gypsies,” a word that is historically charged and considered a slur
by Romani people. You may choose to discuss this point with students and omit the term from
students’ reading, replacing it with “Roma” or “Romani people.”


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades K–2 will already have pertinent
background knowledge for this unit. For students who have not received prior instruction in the
program, introductory knowledge is addressed at the beginning of each unit.


Nursery Rhymes and Fables (Kindergarten)


Fairy Tales and Folktales (Kindergarten)


Sharing Stories (Grade 1)


Fairy Tales and Tall Tales (Grade 2)


Stories of the Ancient Greeks (Grade 2)


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students have many opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for different purposes. The
formal writing piece for this unit is a teacher-guided opinion paragraph. Students will review
the elements of effective paragraphs and review the writing process. Teachers may allow moreadvanced students to work independently. The project can be done with or without the use of
technology, but having students use computers to research, write, and publish their projects is
highly recommended.


Everyday writing opportunities come in many forms, including short and extended responses
requiring evidence from the text. Students will also use graphic organizers to gather and categorize
information from reading or from the Read-Aloud, or to plan for writing. Many lessons provide
opportunities for students to collaborate, share ideas, and give feedback on their writing.


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving
appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete
activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**PERFORMANCE TASKS AND ASSESSMENTS**~~


The Primary Focus objectives in each lesson are carefully structured and sequenced throughout
the unit to help build student understanding. Additionally, formative assessments are provided to
help keep track of students’ progress toward objectives and standards. These can be found in the
Student Activity Book, and are referenced in every lesson.


While some units in Grade 3 have extended Performance Task assessments, this unit contains the
Beginning-of-Year Assessment for benchmarking and placement information. Additional resources,
such as a Fluency Supplement, are available in the online materials. These may be used with
students who need additional support.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials
site. This component was created to accompany materials for Grade 3. It consists of selections
from a variety of genres, including poetry, folklore, and fables. These selections provide additional
opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). Teachers
may also wish to use these selections to assess students’ performance in fluency and expression
(prosody). A fluency rubric is included in the supplement to help track students’ progress towards
fluent reading. For more information on implementation, please consult the supplement.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


Note to Teacher


If you have not already done so, we highly recommend that you review “The
Basic and Advanced Code” and “Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable
Words” located in the Teacher Resources before teaching this lesson.


In this unit, students will focus on three academic vocabulary words:
_narrative_, _introduce_, and _chronological order_ . Academic vocabulary words are
ones that support reading comprehension and may appear across a variety
of materials, in language arts and in content areas. Understanding academic
vocabulary may contribute to improved performance on assignments and
assessments, as these words often appear in directions to students. These
words may appear on end-of-year assessments that third graders may
take. Where applicable, use the words throughout the unit, not just as they
might refer to reading selections but also with regard to spelling, grammar,
morphology, and comprehension. They may also appear in directions,
assessments, spelling lists, and discussion questions, among other places.


  - We define the word _narrative_ to mean a story.


  - To _introduce_ means to present something new to someone.


  - _Chronological order_ is the arrangement of events in order as they happen
in time.


**Note:** We encourage you to use all three of these words throughout the

school day so that students may experience multiple uses of them.

~~**VOCABULARY: “THE RIVER BANK, PART I”**~~


The following are core vocabulary words used in this lesson. Preview the
words with the students before the lesson. Students are not expected to be
able to use these words immediately, but with repeated exposure throughout
the lessons, they will acquire a good understanding of most of the words.
Students may also keep a “unit dictionary” notebook along with definitions,
sentences, and/or other writing exercises using these vocabulary words.


**backwater,** a peaceful body of water connected to a river, but with little
or almost no current or movement; an isolated, unchanging village or
town ( **backwaters** )


**bolted,** moved or ran off suddenly ( **bolt, bolts, bolting** )


**contemplated,** considered or thought about; pondered ( **contemplate,**
**contemplates, contemplating** )

Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that you are going to be reading an adaptation of the
book titled _The Wind in the Willows_ and that they will hear a chapter each day
for the next few weeks.


 - Tell students that willows are a type of tree. Show students Image Card C.U1.
L1.1
(Willow Tree) as an example. Explain that there are many types of willows,
and these particular ones are weeping willow trees. Tell students that willows
like a lot of water and, therefore, tend to grow near sources of water such as
rivers, lakes, and ponds.


 - Tell students that the story they are going to hear is fiction. Ask, “Who can tell
me what fiction is?”


 - Explain that _The Wind in the Willows_ was written by a man named Kenneth
Grahame. He was born in Scotland, but he moved to England when he was
very young.


 - Explain to students that Scotland and England are two of the four countries
making up the United Kingdom (or the U.K. for short), along with Wales and
Northern Ireland.


 - Locate the United Kingdom on the map and point out England.


 - Tell students that citizens of the United Kingdom are called “British” because
the main landmass of the United Kingdom is called Great Britain.


 - Explain that Grahame told these stories to his son (whom he called Mouse)
for entertainment before he ever wrote them down.


 - Explain that the setting of this story is the English countryside—where the
author grew up—near a river called the Thames [TEMZ]. Locate the river
Thames on the map and show students how it runs through the country
of England.


 - Ask students how they believe that a setting on a river might affect the plot,
or events, of the story.


 - Hold up a soda can and direct students to different corners of the room
based on whether they call the item in your hand “pop,” “soda,” “Coke,”
or “soft drink.” (Note: If all students go to the same corner, you may try
the same activity with the words “bubbler,” “water fountain,” or “drinking
fountain,” or any other variation in dialect you may have noticed in your
students.)

- Explain that these differences in words can be found all over the United
States, and that these are called differences in dialect; even though people
may be speaking the same language, there may be some differences in the
words they use.


- Because _The Wind in the Willows_ is set in the United Kingdom, the book is
written in British English. Just as there are differences in vocabulary between
people in the United States, there are differences in vocabulary between
British and American English.


- Tell students that _The Wind in the Willows_ was published in 1908, more than
100 years ago, and is considered one of the best children’s stories ever
written.


- Ask students if they know of any stories that are considered classics. Ask
students if they’ve read or heard of _Charlotte’s Web, Alice in Wonderland, The_
_Chronicles of Narnia, Where the Wild Things Are,_ or _A Wrinkle in Time_ . Remind
them that these are just a few examples of many classic books.


- Tell students the main characters of _The Wind in the Willows_ are a mole,
a water rat (European water vole), a badger, and a toad. Explain that the
characters in this story act like people.


- You may wish to show students Image Card C.U1.L1.6 (River Bank)
to give them an understanding of the setting of the story.


- Explain that when an animal or thing in a story behaves or is described

like a person, it is called personification. Have students repeat the word
_personification_ after you.


- Ask students what word they hear inside the word _personification_ .


- Prompt students to recognize the word _person,_ and remind them that

personification is when an animal or thing is given the characteristics of
a person, such as talking, wearing clothes, etc.


- Tell students that throughout the book, they will hear many examples

Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L1.1**
Mole cleaning his house


The Mole had been working very hard

all the morning spring-cleaning his

little home: first with brooms, then with

dusters; then on ladders and steps and

chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash. He did this until he had

dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his

black fur. Spring was moving in the air above and the earth below,

and around him and his dark and lowly little house. Any wonder he

suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, said “Bother!” and “O

blow!” and also “Hang spring-cleaning!” and **bolted** out of the house

without even waiting to put on his coat.


Mole immediately made for the steep little tunnel, and without a

moment’s hesitation, he began scraping, scratching, and scrabbling.

He worked busily with his little paws and muttered to himself, “Up we

go! Up we go!” till at last, pop! His snout came out into the sunlight,

and he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.

~~“Bother,” “O blow,” and “hang” are examples of British sayings that~~

~~show someone doesn’t like something. Ask students for examples of~~

~~American sayings that show the same.~~


**Show Image U1.L1.2**
Mole in the meadow


“This is fine!” he said to himself. “This

is better than whitewashing!” he added

as he jumped with delight at the joy of

spring. In this state of happiness, he

made his way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the

farther side.



Challenge


Ask students to repeat
the things Mole says as
he flings his brush to the
floor. Based on these
statements, ask students
how Mole feels about
cleaning his home.

It all seemed too good to be true, as moving hither and thither

he observed everywhere birds building, and leaves and flowers

bursting forth.


He thought his happiness was complete when, as he **meandered**

aimlessly along, he came to the edge of a full-fed river. There he

stood quite mesmerized, as never before had he seen a river. He

watched in awe as it shimmered and shined, gurgled and burbled,

swirled and curled its way seaward. So bewitched and fascinated was

he, that he trotted for a while by the side of it. Eventually, exhausted

by this tremendous effort, he sat down on the bank to rest.


As he sat on the grass and gazed across the river, a dark hole in the

bank opposite, just above the water’s edge, caught his eye. Mole

quietly **contemplated** what a nice snug dwelling place it would make.

As he gazed, something bright and small seemed to twinkle like a tiny

star down in the heart of it. But it could hardly be a star, and it was

too glittering and small for a glowworm. Then, as he looked, it winked

at him, and so revealed itself to be an eye; and a small face began

gradually to grow up round it, like a frame round a picture.


A brown little face, with whiskers.


A grave round face, with the same twinkle in its eye.


Small neat ears and thick silky hair.


It was the Water Rat!


The two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously.


“Hullo, Mole!” said the Water Rat.


“Hullo, Rat!” said the Mole.


“Would you like to come over?” enquired the Rat.


“Oh, it’s all very well to ask,” said the Mole, rather grumpily, he being

new to a river and riverside life and its ways.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


**Show Image U1.L1.3**
Rat sculling over to Mole


The Rat said nothing, but stooped

and unfastened a rope and hauled

on it; then lightly stepped into a

little boat which the Mole had not

observed. It was painted blue outside and white within, and was just

the size for two animals; and the Mole loved it immediately.


The Rat sculled across. Then he held up his forepaw as the Mole

stepped gingerly down. “Lean on that!” he said. “Now then, step

lively!” and the Mole to his great delight found himself actually seated

in the stern of a real boat. ~~What do you think the word~~ ~~_sculled_~~ ~~means?~~


This has been a wonderful day!” said he, as the Rat shoved off and

took to the sculls again. “Do you know, I’ve never been in a boat

before in all my life.”


“What?” cried the Rat, open-mouthed: “Never been in a—you never—

well I—what have you been doing, then?”


“Is it so nice as all that?” asked the Mole shyly, though he was quite

prepared to believe it as he leant back in his seat and surveyed the

cushions, the oars, and all the fascinating fittings.


“Nice? It’s the _only_ thing,” said the Water Rat solemnly, as he

leant forward for his stroke. “Believe me, my young friend, there is

nothing—absolutely nothing—half so much worth doing as simply

messing about in boats. Simply messing,” he went on dreamily:

“messing—about—in—boats; messing—”


“Look ahead, Rat!” cried the Mole suddenly.


It was too late. The boat struck the bank full tilt. The oarsman lay on his

back at the bottom of the boat, his heels in the air. ~~What do you think~~

~~an oarsman is? Tell students the oarsman is the person with the oars.~~

**17**


**18**



“—about in boats—or _with_ boats,” the Rat went on cheerily, picking

himself up with a pleasant laugh. “In or out of ’em, it doesn’t matter.

Look here! If you’ve really nothing else to do, what do you say we

spend time on the river together?”


**Show Image U1.L1.4**
Mole and Rat boating on the river


The Mole waggled his toes from sheer

happiness, spread his chest with a

sigh of contentment, and leaned back

blissfully into the soft cushions. “What

a day I’m having!” he said. “Let us start at once.”


“Hold on a minute, then!” said the Rat as he tied fast the boat

and climbed up into his hole above. Moments later he reappeared

staggering under a fat, wicker, luncheon basket.


“Shove that under your feet,” he said to the Mole, as he passed it

down into the boat. Then he untied the boat and took the sculls again.


“What’s inside it?” asked the Mole, eagerly.


“There’s cold chicken inside it,” replied the Rat; “coldtonguecoldham
coldbeef-pickledgherkins-salad-frenchrollscresssandwiches
pottedmeat-gingerbeer-lemonade-sodawater—”


“O stop, stop,” cried the Mole: “This is too much!”


“Do you really think so?” enquired the Rat seriously. “It’s only what

I always take on these little excursions. The other animals complain

that I hardly have enough!”


The Mole did not hear a word he said. He was already absorbed in

the new life he was entering upon. He trailed a paw in the water and

dreamed long, waking dreams. The Water Rat, like the good little

fellow he was, sculled steadily on and did not disturb him.


“I like your clothes, old chap,” the Rat remarked after some half

an hour or so had passed. “I’m going to get a velvet jacket myself

someday.” ~~”Old chap” is a British saying for~~ ~~_man_~~ ~~or~~ ~~_boy_~~ ~~.~~


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“I beg your pardon,” said the Mole, pulling himself together with an

effort. “You must think me very rude; but all this is so new to me.

So—this—is—a—River!”


“ _The_ River,” corrected the Rat.


“And you really live by the river? What a jolly life!”


“By it and with it and on it and in it,” said the Rat. “It’s brother and

sister to me, and aunts, and company, and food and drink, and

(naturally) washing. It’s my world, and I don’t want any other.”


“But isn’t it a bit dull at times?” the Mole asked. “Just you and the

river, and no one else to pass a word with?”


“No one else to—well, I mustn’t be hard on you,” said the Rat. “You’re

new to it. The bank is so crowded nowadays that many people are

moving away altogether. O no, it isn’t what it used to be, at all. Otters,

kingfishers, dabchicks, moorhens, all of them about all day long and

always wanting you to do something—as if a fellow had no business

of his own to attend to!”

“What lies over _there_ ?” asked the Mole,

waving a paw towards a background of

woodland that darkly framed the water
meadows on one side of the river.


“W-e-ll,” replied the Rat hesitantly, “that’s the Wild Wood. We don’t go

there too often.”


“Are there scary creatures there?” Mole asked, trying not to tremble.


“The squirrels are all right,” Rat replied. “And the rabbits—some of ’em,

but rabbits are a mixed lot. And then there’s Badger, of course. He lives

right in the heart of it; wouldn’t live anywhere else, either. Dear old

Badger! Nobody **interferes** with _him_ .”

“Weasels, stoats, foxes, and so on. They’re all right in a way; I’m very

good friends with them; pass the time of day when we meet, but you

can’t trust them, and that’s a fact.”


“And beyond the Wild Wood?” Mole asked.


“Beyond the Wild Wood is the Wide World,” said the Rat. “And that’s

something that doesn’t matter, either to you or me. I’ve never been

there, and I’m never going, nor you either, if you’ve got any sense.

**Primary Focus:** Students will review short vowel sounds and multisyllable



words.



~~**TEKS 3.2.A.ii; TEKS 3.2.D**~~



~~**SHORT VOWEL REVIEW (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Follow these steps to review short vowels:


    - Show students the /a/ Spelling Card with the ‘a’– _hat_ side facing students.
Point to the ‘a’ and ask students to name the letter. Then, read the word
_hat_ and remind them that the letter ‘a’ is used to spell and write /a/ in
English words. Remind students that /a/ is a vowel sound. Vowel sounds
will always be written in green on the Spelling Cards because when we say
a vowel sound, we open our mouths, letting the air “go.”


    - Point out the power bar below the spelling ‘a’ and remind students
that this bar indicates how common each spelling is. If the card shows a very
common spelling for a sound—a spelling used in lots and lots of words—there
will be a long power bar on the card that stretches almost across the entire
card. If the card shows a less common spelling for this sound—a spelling used
in a smaller number of words—the card will have a shorter power bar.


    - Point to the power bar under the ‘a’ and ask students whether they think
the letter ‘a’ is a very common spelling or a less common spelling for /a/.
(very common)


    - Explain to students that like last year, this year they will each have an Individual
Code Chart. This year’s Individual Code Chart will look a bit different since they
are in Grade 3. Distribute the Individual Code Chart to each student. Ask them
to write their name in the blank at the bottom of the cover page.


**TEKS 3.2.A.ii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


**Lesson 1 The River Bank, Part I**
**23**


**24**




   - Now, ask students to turn to Individual Code Chart page 3. Ask students to

find the row on the chart that begins with /a/.


   - Tell students to point to the spot in the row on the chart that shows the
‘a’ spelling for /a/, as in _hat_ .


   - Prompt students to summarize the code information on the chart: “This
tells us that /a/ is spelled as the letter ‘a’ in written words. The long power
bar tells us that it is a very common spelling.” (In fact, it is the only spelling
for /a/. This information can be deduced based on the fact that there are
no other spots on the chart in this row for other ways to spell /a/.)


   - Repeat these steps with the /i/ Spelling Card, the /e/ Spelling Card, the
/u/ Spelling Card, and the /o/ Spelling Card.


**Note:** You will have students read the decodable passage, “Summary of
‘The River Bank, Part I,’” that you prepared in advance to practice decoding
words with short vowels. After students read, provide immediate, corrective
feedback as needed.


~~**ENCODING SHORT VOWEL WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Before you begin this activity, take a few moments to review with students
how to break a multisyllable word into parts. Explain that knowing how
to break apart a long word into syllables may help students in decoding
multisyllable words. You might do the following:


 - Write the word _batman_ in cursive on the board.


 - Remind students that words have syllables and that each syllable has one
vowel sound.


 - Ask students to tell you where the vowels are in this word. Underline the letter ‘a’ in
both syllables. Point out to students that there are two consonants between these
two vowel sounds. Remind students that words are divided into syllables between
consonants. Draw a line between the letter ‘t’ and the letter ‘m’ in _batman_ . Note
that students can now clearly see that there are two syllables in this word.


   - bat | man


 - Cover the last syllable, ‘man’, with your hand and guide students in sounding
out the first syllable, ‘bat’. Then, cover ‘bat’ with your hand and guide students
in sounding out ‘man’. Now, guide students in blending both of the syllables
together. You might use a prompt like “say it fast” to encourage them to blend
through both syllables.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


  - Point out that the ‘a’ spelling in each of these syllables represents the /a/
sound they just reviewed with the Individual Code Chart.


  - Practice with students using the following words as well: _fabric_, _victim_, and
_signal_ . (fab | ric, vic | tim, sig | nal)


  - Now, write the word _children_ in cursive on the board.


  - Ask students to tell you what the vowels are in this word. Underline the

letters ‘ _i_ ’ and ‘e’. Point out to students that in this word, there are three
consonants between the vowel sounds. Often, when there are three
consonants between two vowels, the syllable divides after the first
consonant. Draw a line between the letter ‘l’ and the letter ‘d’ in _children_ .


    - chil | dren


  - Again, point out that the ‘i’ and ‘e’ spellings represent the /i/ and /e/ sounds
they reviewed earlier in the Individual Code Chart.


  - Now, practice with the word _hundred_ . (hun | dred)


  - Point out finally that the ‘u’ and ‘e’ spellings represent the vowel sounds they
have reviewed.


  - Write the following sentences on the board in cursive:


    - Mole ran to the little ____ (tunnel).


    - There were many ___ (rabbits) in the garden.


    - There was ___ (nothing) left behind.


    - There were many words ____ (within) the book.


  - Tell students that you will read a sentence out loud. Tell them to notice that
the sentence has a __ (blank). In the blank, they will spell the word you say.
Remind students to use their best cursive handwriting.

**Paragraph 8**

 - Tell students to read **paragraph 8** to find the answer to the question: “What

other things about Sir Gus made him a ‘not so fearless’ knight?” Ask a
student to read aloud.


“Sir Gus was rather absentminded. He got lost a lot and could rarely tell

which way to go. Sir Gus found it difficult to get up in the morning. He liked
to sleep in, so he was late most of the time.”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that in the previous lesson, they began listening to the
classic children’s story _The Wind in the Willows_ .


 - Ask students to share the names of the main characters they met in the first
Read-Aloud.


» Mole, Water Rat


 - Ask students to share some of the plot, or events, in the previous Read-Aloud.


 - Remind students that they have heard many examples of personification.


 - Ask students to explain personification and to give examples from the text
they have heard so far.


 - Remind students that Mole learns about life on the river from speaking with
Rat. Ask students what we call the part of a story where the characters speak
to one another.


» dialogue


 - Ask students to share how they know when they are reading dialogue.


» Dialogue has quotation marks.


 - Ask students if they know the name for the part of the story that tells what is
happening and does not have quotation marks around it.


» narration


 - Tell students that narration and dialogue are two literary tools, or two ways
the author tells a story.


 - Ask students to recall the setting of the previous Read-Aloud. Ask, “Through

whose eyes do we first discover the river bank?”


» Mole’s


 - Explain to students that this is called perspective.


 - Explain that perspective is how someone sees or experiences something.

Tell students that in fictional stories, perspective is another literary tool, like
dialogue and narration, that lets the reader know from whose experience
the scene of the story is mainly being described. Explain that, like dialogue,
perspective can shift from one character to another as a way of telling more
about the story.


 - Tell students that today they will be introduced to a new animal character, an
otter. Show students Image Card C.U1.L1.8 (Otter). Explain the following
about otters:


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_



**38**


  - Adult otters are 25 to 35 inches in length, not including their tail, which can
be 14 to 18 inches long.


  - Otters live in and around the water.


  - Like badgers, otters belong to the weasel family. Otters are playful
creatures and great swimmers.


  - They are semiaquatic (meaning they spend time in and out of water), like
water rats.


  - They have brownish fur on their backs; cream-colored bellies; long, strong
necks; webbed feet; and a long, flattened tail.


  - They live in burrows that they dig into river banks, or in hollowed-out trees
near rivers, streams, or ponds.


  - Otters eat fish, shellfish, birds, insects, and frogs.


  - Otters have a backbone. Their skeleton is inside their body. They’re warmblooded mammals. Their babies are born alive, and their mothers feed
them milk from their own bodies.


- Remind students that after the last Read-Aloud, Rat and Mole were getting
ready to picnic on the backwater. Ask students to predict what kind of
adventures Mole and Rat might have on the backwater.


- Tell students to listen carefully to see if their predictions are correct. Image Card

Mole and Rat’s picnic


Leaving the main stream, they now

passed into what seemed like a little

land-locked lake. Green grass sloped

down to either edge; brown, snaky tree

roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water. Ahead of them

could be heard the foamy tumble of a weir with a restless dripping mill

wheel attached to a mill house. ~~A weir is a type of dam or wall that holds~~

~~water back. Show Image Card C.U1.L2.1 (Weir). A mill is a building that~~

The scene was so beautiful that the Mole could only hold up both

forepaws and gasp, “O my!”


The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank and tied it up. Then

he helped the still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the

luncheon basket. The Mole asked to be allowed to unpack it all by

himself. The Rat was very pleased to indulge him. Mole excitedly

shook out the tablecloth and spread it. Then one by one he took out

the mysterious packets and carefully **arranged** them, still gasping,

“O my! O my!”


When all was ready, the Rat said, “Eat up, old fellow!” and the Mole,

who had started his spring cleaning at a very early hour, and had not

eaten since then, eagerly set to work.


“What are you looking at?” said the Rat presently, when the edge of

their hunger was somewhat dulled, and the Mole’s eyes were able to

wander off the tablecloth.


“I am looking,” said the Mole, “at a streak of bubbles that I see

traveling along the surface of the water.”


“Bubbles? Oh!” said the Rat cheerily.


A broad glistening muzzle showed itself above the edge of the bank,

and the Otter hauled himself out and shook the water from his coat.


“Greedy beggars!” he observed. “Why didn’t you invite me, Ratty?”


“This was a spontaneous affair,” explained the Rat. “By the way, meet

my friend Mr. Mole.”


“Proud, I’m sure,” said the Otter, and the two animals were friends

forthwith.


“Such a rumpus everywhere!” continued the Otter. “The entire world

seems to be out on the river today. I came up this backwater to try to

get a moment’s peace, and then stumbled upon you fellows!”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


**Show Image U1.L2.2**
Otter and Badger


At that moment, there was a

rustling sound behind them. It

seemed to come from a hedge

wherein last year’s leaves still

clung. Seconds later, a stripy head, with high shoulders, peered out

from within.


“Come on, old Badger!” shouted the Rat.


The Badger trotted forward, then grunted, “H’m! Company,” and

turned his back and disappeared from view.


“That’s _just_ the sort of fellow he is!” observed the disappointed Rat.

“Simply hates society! Now we shan’t see any more of him today.

Well, tell us, _who’s_ out on the river?”


“Toad’s out, for one,” replied the Otter. “In his brand new wager-boat;

new togs, new everything!” ~~A wager-boat is a special boat used for~~

~~rowing races. They were called wager-boats because people would~~

~~wage bets (gamble) on the winner. Togs are special clothes worn for~~

~~an activity.~~


The two animals looked at each other and laughed.


“Once, it was nothing but sailing,” said the Rat. “Then he tired of that

and took to punting. Nothing would please him but to punt all day.

Last year it was house boating, and we all had to go and stay with him

in his houseboat, and pretend we liked it. It’s all the same, whatever

he takes up; he gets tired of it, and starts on something fresh.”


“Such a good fellow, too,” remarked the Otter reflectively: “But no

Toad on the river


From where they sat they could get

a glimpse of the mainstream across

the island that separated them; and

just then a wager-boat flashed into

view. The rower was a short, stout figure, who was splashing badly

and rolling a good deal, but working his hardest. The Rat stood up

and hailed him. However Toad, for it was he, shook his head and

concentrated on the task at hand.


“He’ll be out of the boat in a minute if he rolls like that,” said the Rat.


“Of course he will,” chuckled the Otter. “Did I ever tell you that good

story about Toad and the lock-keeper? ~~Show Image Card C.U1.L2.3~~

~~(Canal Lock). In a canal (man-made waterway), a lock is an area~~

~~blocked off at each end by gates. The gates are opened or closed to~~

~~allow water to fill or drain from the lock so the boats can safely move.~~

~~A lock-keeper is in charge of the gates.~~


“The story happened this way,” Otter continued. “Toad—”


At that moment a mayfly swerved unsteadily on the gentle spring

breeze toward Otter. There was a swirl of water and a “cloop!” and the

mayfly was visible no more. Neither was the Otter.


The Mole looked down. The voice was still in his ears, but the grass

whereon he had sprawled was clearly vacant. Not an Otter to be seen.


But again there was a streak of bubbles on the surface of the river.

The Rat hummed a tune, and the Mole remembered that it was

considered rude to make any sort of comment about the sudden

disappearance of one’s friends.


“Well, well,” said the Rat, “I suppose we ought to be moving. I wonder

which one of us should pack the luncheon basket?” He did not sound

overly eager to do it himself.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“O, please let me,” said the Mole. So, of course, the Rat let him.


The afternoon sun was getting low as the Rat sculled gently

homewards. The Mole was very full of lunch, and self-satisfaction,

and already quite at home in a boat (or so he thought). He was,

however, getting a bit restless, and presently he said, “Ratty! Please, I

want to row, now!”


The Rat shook his head with a smile. “Not yet, my young friend,” he

said. “Wait till you’ve had a few lessons.”


The Mole was quiet for a minute or two. But he began to feel more

and more jealous of Rat. Suddenly he jumped up and **seized** the

sculls from him. Rat, who had been gazing out over the water, was

taken by surprise. He fell backwards off his seat. The triumphant

Mole took his place and grabbed the sculls with much confidence.


“Stop it, you _silly_ !” cried the Rat, from the bottom of the boat. “You’ll

have us over!”


**Show Image U1.L2.4**
Mole overturns the boat


The Mole flung his sculls back

with a flourish, and made a great

dig at the water. He missed

the surface altogether, his legs

flew up above his head, and he found himself lying on top of

the Rat.


Greatly alarmed, he made a grab at the side of the boat, and the next

moment—Sploosh!


Over went the boat, and Mole found himself struggling in the river.


O my, how cold the water was, and O, how very wet it felt. How it sang in

his ears as he went down, down, down! How bright and welcome the sun

looked as he rose to the surface coughing and spluttering! How black

was his despair when he felt himself sinking again! Then a firm paw

gripped him by the back of his neck. It was the Rat, and he was laughing.

The Rat got hold of a scull and shoved it under the Mole’s arm. Then

he did the same by the other side of him and, swimming behind,

propelled the helpless animal to shore.


When the Rat had rubbed him down, and wrung some of the wet out

of him, he said, “Now, then, old fellow! Trot up and down till you’re

warm and dry again, while I dive for the luncheon basket.”


So the dismal Mole, wet without and ashamed within, trotted about

till he was fairly dry, while the Rat plunged into the water again. He

recovered the boat, fetched his floating property, and finally dived

successfully for the luncheon basket.


When all was ready to begin again, the Mole, limp and **dejected**, took

his seat in the stern of the boat; and as they set off, he said in a low

voice, “Ratty, my generous friend! I am very sorry indeed for my foolish

behavior. My heart quite fails me when I think how I might have lost that

beautiful luncheon basket. I have been a fool. Will you ever forgive me?”


“That’s all right. Bless you!” responded the Rat cheerily. “What’s a

little wet to a Water Rat? I’m more in the water than out of it most

days. Don’t you think any more about it; and, look here! I really think

you had better come and stop with me for a little time. My home is

very plain and rough, but I am sure I can make you comfortable. And

I’ll teach you to row, and to swim.”


The Mole was so touched by his kindness that he had to brush away

a tear. But the Rat kindly looked in another direction, and before long

the Mole’s spirits revived again.


**Show Image U1.L2.5**
At Rat’s home before the hearth


When they got home, the Rat made

a bright fire in the parlor. He planted

the Mole in an arm chair in front of it.

He fetched down a dressing gown and

slippers for him, and told him river stories till supper-time.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_



**44**


Supper was a most cheerful meal. Shortly afterwards, a sleepy Mole had

to be **escorted** upstairs by his host, to the best bedroom. There he laid

his head on his pillow in great peace and contentment. This was just the

beginning of their friendship and time together on the river.

~~**WORD WORK: DEJECTED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _dejected_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You
may review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In today’s Read-Aloud you heard, “When all was ready to begin again, the
Mole, limp and _dejected_, took his seat in the stern of the boat.”


3. Say the word _dejected_ with me.


4. When someone is dejected, he or she is feeling sad or depressed.


5. Kylie felt dejected when she wasn’t chosen for the job opening.


6. Have you ever felt dejected? Why did you feel this way? Be sure to use the
word _dejected_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences:
“I felt dejected once when . . .”)


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _dejected_ ?


 - Use an Acting and Sharing activity for follow-up. Say, “Turn to your partner
and show them how you might act if you felt dejected. Then share with your

words. ~~**TEKS 3.2.A.ii**~~


~~**SHORT AND LONG VOWEL REVIEW (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Before beginning today's activity, quickly review the short vowel sounds
practiced in the previous lesson.


  - Draw students’ attention to the Vowel Chart you created and displayed in
advance. Read the words in each column with students, underlining the vowel
sound in each word. After reading each column, isolate the vowel sound.


  - Now point out that there is only one letter or spelling that represents the
vowel sound in each word in this chart.


  - Follow these procedures to review long vowels:


    - Write the word _bake_ on the board and ask if any students can read it.


    - Ask students to tell you the vowel sound in _bake_ . (/ae/)


    - Point out that the spelling that stands for the vowel sound in _bake_ is a
different kind of spelling consisting of two separated letters that work
as a team.


    - Explain to students that even though the ‘a’ and the ‘e’ in _bake_ are
separated, they work together to stand for the /ae/ sound.


    - Circle each spelling in _bake_ as you say its sound.


**Note:** You will need to draw a horseshoe-shaped loop around the ‘a’ and the

‘e’ to show that these two letters work together to stand for the /ae/ sound.


  - Point to each spelling in _bake_ as you say its sound: “/b/” (point to the letter

‘b’ with your index finger), “/ae/” (simultaneously point to the letter ‘a’ with
your middle finger and the letter ‘e’ with your index finger), “/k/” (point to the
letter ‘k’ with your index finger).


  - Show students the Spelling Card for ‘a_e’> /ae/ ( _cake_ ). Have students read
the sample word. Discuss the power bar. Point out that the power bar does
not stretch all the way across the card. This means there are some other
spellings for this sound that students will study later.


**TEKS 3.2.A.ii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


  - Next, write the word _Pete_ on the board and ask if any students can read it.


  - Ask students to tell you the vowel sound in _Pete._ (/ee/)


  - Point out that the spelling that stands for the vowel sound in _Pete_ is a different
kind of spelling consisting of two separated letters that work as a team.


  - Explain to students that even though the first ‘e’ and the second ‘e’ in _Pete_ are
separated, they work together to stand for the /ee/sound.


  - Circle each spelling in _Pete_ as you say its sound.


  - Show students the Spelling Card for ‘e_e’> /ee/ ( _Pete_ ). Have students read
the sample word. Discuss the power bar. Point out that the power bar does
not stretch all the way across the card. This means that there are some other
spellings for this sound that students will study later.


  - Repeat the above steps for the remaining separated digraph spellings using
the words _vowel team_ : ‘i_e’, ‘o_e’, and ‘u_e’. Remember to prompt students to
summarize the code information conveyed on their chart. You may consider
asking them to turn to a partner and summarize the information. This may
also be a good time to point out to students that the spellings for each sound
on the chart are sequenced in order from the most frequently used spelling to
the least frequently used spelling. For example, have students look at ‘a_e’ > /
ae/ on the Individual Code Chart page 3. Note that there is one other spelling
for /ae/ that occurs more frequently (‘a’), but ‘a_e’ is in the second position,
and so it is a very frequently used spelling for /ae/.


  - While students are discussing the sound spelling poster, circulate and correct any
misconceptions, especially students that are not pronouncing the sounds correctly
or that need a reminder of the long vowel sound made by a particular vowel team.


  - Now, have students look at ‘e_e’ > /ee/ on the Individual Code Chart page 3,
and examine the position of this spelling relative to other spellings for /ee/.
Ask students to summarize what the placement of ‘e_e’ on the Code Chart
indicates. (‘e_e’ is a relatively infrequent, or rare, spelling for /ee/.)


  - Repeat the explanation of sequencing on the Individual Code Chart for
‘i_e’>/ ie/,‘o_e’> /oe/,and ‘u_e’ >/ue/.


~~**DICTATION (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Make sure every student has the writing materials you have selected

(notebook or lined paper and pencil).


  - Review with students how to chunk multisyllable words into single syllables, letting
them know that today’s dictation words are two-syllable words. Tell students they


Lesson 2 The River Bank, Part II
**49**


are to write the word you say. Read the first word, use it in a sentence, and then
read the word only once more, allowing time for students to write.


- Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.D]**~~


- Follow the procedure with each of these words.


1. sunshine 4. homerun


2. bonfire 5. cupcake


3. mistake


- After all of the words have been called out, tell students that you will now
show them the correct spelling for each word so they can correct their own
work. Say and write each word on the board. Instruct students to correct
their work by crossing out every incorrect spelling, then copying and writing
the correct spelling next to it. Be sure to point out the vowel teams.


- Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.6.C; TEKS 3.8.A**~~


  - Remind students that in the previous lesson they learned about the literary

tool of perspective. Briefly review the literary tools of dialogue, narration, and
perspective by asking the following questions:


    - What is dialogue? (what characters say to each other)

    - What distinguishes narration from dialogue? (quotation marks)

    - What is perspective in fictional stories? (a character’s experiences,
actions, and thoughts through which the story is told)

    - From whose perspective was the last Real-Aloud told? (Mole’s)


  - Ask students to share some of the plot, or events, from the previous ReadAlouds. (Mole grows weary of spring cleaning and leaves his burrow to go
aboveground; he meanders along the river and meets Water Rat. Water Rat
tells Mole about life on the river as Rat rows along the river. Mole and Rat go
boating and have a picnic; they meet Otter, and see Badger and Toad; Mole
overturns the boat; Mole stays with Rat.)


  - Explain to students that over the next few days they will be learning about
the themes in _The Wind in the Willows_ .


  - Ask students if they know what a theme is.


  - Explain to students that a theme is a broad idea that comes up many times over

the course of a story or book. Themes are another part of fiction writing, like
characters, setting, and plot, which the author uses to help guide the story.


  - Explain to students that there are many recurring themes in _The Wind in the_
_Willows_ . This means that the themes repeat again and again in the story.
Tell students that some of these recurring themes are friendship, loyalty,
responsibility, and irresponsibility.


  - Ask students if they can think of any examples of the theme of friendship
from what they have heard so far in _The Wind in the Willows_ .


» Mole offering to pack up the picnic lunch while Rat rests. Rat rescues Mole from

the river and then forgives Mole for overturning his boat.


  - Remind students that Rat “let bygones be bygones.”


  - Tell students that another theme that appears throughout _The Wind in the_
_Willows_ is loyalty. When people are loyal, that means they stay faithful and
committed to something or someone no matter what.


  - Lastly, tell students that the themes of responsibility and irresponsibility also
appear throughout _The Wind in the Willows_ . A responsible person is someone

who takes care of the things he or she is supposed to. A responsible person
does good work, and can be trusted and depended on to do the right things.
Ask students what they think irresponsibility is.


 - Tell students to listen for examples of the recurring themes of friendship/
loyalty, responsibility, and irresponsibility in today’s Read-Aloud. Also, have
students listen carefully to hear if their predictions are correct.

Rat writes duck-inspired poetry


“Ratty,” said the Mole suddenly, one

bright summer morning, “I want to ask

you a favor.”


The Rat was sitting on the river

bank, singing a little song called “Ducks’ Ditty” that he had

just composed.


_All along the backwater,_

_Through the rushes tall,_

_Ducks are a-dabbling,_

_Up tails all!_


_Ducks’ tails, drakes’ tails,_

_Yellow feet a-quiver,_

_Yellow bills all out of sight_

_Busy in the river!_


_Everyone for what he likes!_

_We like to be_

_Heads down, tails up,_

_Dabbling free!_


“I don’t know if I like that song, Rat,” said the Mole cautiously.


“Nor do the ducks,” replied the Rat.

Remind students that _ir–_
is a prefix meaning
“not” that makes the
word _irresponsibility_ an

“Ratty,” began the Mole again. “What I wanted to ask was, won’t you

take me to **call on** Mr. Toad? I’ve heard so much about him.”


“Why, certainly,” said the good-natured Rat. “Get the boat out. It’s

never the wrong time to call on Toad!”


“He must be a very nice animal,” observed the Mole, as he got into

the boat and took the sculls.


“He is indeed the best of animals,” replied Rat as they set off to visit

the distinguished Mr. Toad.


Before long, as they were rounding a bend in the river, they came

in sight of an elegant, old, red brick house, with well-kept lawns

reaching down to the water’s edge.


“There’s Toad Hall,” said the Rat; “and that creek on the left, where

the notice-board says ‘Private’ leads to his boathouse, where we’ll

leave the boat. The stables are over there to the right. That’s the

banqueting hall you’re looking at now. Toad is rich, you know.”


**Show Image U1.L3.2**
Mr. Toad at home


They glided up the creek, and into

the shadow of a large boathouse.

There they disembarked, and went

in search of Toad. They found Toad

resting in a wicker garden chair, with a large map spread out on his

knees.


“Hooray!” he cried, jumping up on seeing them. “This is splendid!” He

shook the paws of both of them warmly. “I was just going to send a

boat down the river for you, Ratty. I need your help,” said Toad.


“It’s about your rowing, I suppose,” said the Rat.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“O, pooh! Boating!” interrupted the Toad. “I’ve given that up. Now


shining with newness and painted a canary-yellow and green.

~~Gypsies, also known as Romani, are wandering people who originally~~

~~came from northern India. A caravan is a large covered wagon that’s~~

~~used as a traveling home. Why did some gypsies use caravans?~~


“There you are!” cried the Toad. “There’s real life for you. The open

road, the dusty highway! This is the very finest cart of its sort. Come

inside and take a look!”


The Mole was tremendously excited, and followed him eagerly up the

steps and into the caravan. The Rat refused to follow.


It was indeed very compact and comfortable. There were sleeping

bunks, a little table that folded up, a cooking stove, a birdcage with a

bird in it, and a variety of pots and pans.


“All complete!” said the Toad, triumphantly, pulling open a cupboard to

reveal a variety of tasty treats. “We are ready to set off this afternoon.”


“I beg your pardon,” said the Rat slowly, “but did I overhear you say

something about ‘ _we_,’ and ‘ _set off_,’ and ‘ _this afternoon_ ’?”


“Now, Ratty,” said Toad, “don’t begin talking in that sniffy sort of way.

I can’t manage without you. You surely don’t mean to stick to your

dull old river all your life.”


“I’m not coming,” said the Rat. “And I _am_ going to stick to my old

river. And what’s more, Mole’s going to stick to me, aren’t you, Mole?”


“Of course I am,” said the Mole, loyally. “All the same, it sounds as if it

might have been fun!” he added, wistfully.

The Rat saw that the Mole was disappointed. He hated disappointing

people. Toad was watching both of them closely.


“Come along in, and have some lunch,” he said, diplomatically, “and

we’ll talk it over. We needn’t decide anything in a hurry.”


During luncheon Toad spoke enthusiastically of the joys of the open

road. So much so, that the Mole could hardly sit still in his chair.

Before long, unable to disappoint his friends, the Rat had agreed to go.


**Show Image U1.L3.4**
Heading for the open road


When they were ready, Toad led

his companions to the paddock

to capture the old grey horse. For

his part, the old grey horse did not

want to be captured. Eventually though, the horse was caught and

harnessed, and they set off. ~~A paddock is a small field.~~


It was a golden afternoon. The smell of the dust they kicked up was

rich and satisfying.


Late in the evening, they drew up on a remote **common**, turned the

horse loose to graze, and ate their simple supper sitting on the grass.

~~A common is a piece of land owned by many people and open to~~

~~the community.~~


At last they turned in to their little bunks in the cart. Toad sleepily said,

“Well, good night, you fellows! This is the real life for a gentleman!”


After so much open air the Toad slept very soundly, and no amount

of shaking could rouse him next morning. So the Mole and Rat set to

work. The Rat saw to the horse, and lit a fire, while the Mole trudged

off to the nearest village for milk and eggs. The hard work had all

been done by the time Toad appeared.


They had a pleasant ramble that day along narrow by-lanes, and

camped as before, on a common. This time the two guests made


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


sure that Toad did his fair share of the work. As a result, when the

time came for starting next morning, Toad was no longer singing the

praises of the open road.


Their way lay, as before, along narrow country lanes, and it was not

till the afternoon that they encountered their first main road. There

disaster struck. For, as they strolled and chatted, from far behind

them an unfamiliar sound could be heard. Glancing back, they saw a

small cloud of dust advancing on them. From out of the dust a faint

“Pup-pup!” sounded. Ignoring this strange vision, they turned to

resume their conversation. Then, in an instant, the peaceful scene

was changed. A blast of wind and a whirl of sound caused them to

jump out of the road! The “pup-pup” sound rang out once more. ~~What~~

~~kind of word is~~ ~~_pup-pup_~~ ~~? (onomatopoeia)~~


**Show Image U1.L3.5**
The motorcar


As this sound rang out, they glimpsed

a magnificent motorcar with its pilot

hugging the wheel. This splendid vehicle

flung a cloud of dust in their direction

and then was gone.


At the sight and sound of this vehicle, the old grey horse reared and

backed towards a ditch. Before long, the canary-yellow and green

colored cart lay on its side.


The Rat danced up and down in the road. “You villains!” he shouted,

shaking both fists.


While Rat was shaking his fists, the Toad sat straight down in the

middle of the dusty road and murmured, “Pup-pup!”


For his part, the Mole was busy trying to quiet the horse. Then he

went to look at the cart, on its side in the ditch.


The Rat came to help him, but to no avail. “Hi! Toad!” they cried.

“Come and help us!”


Lesson 3 The Open Road
**65**


**66**



The Toad did not reply, so they went to see what was the matter. They

found him in a sort of a trance, his eyes still fixed on the dusty road.


The Rat shook him, “Are you coming to help us, Toad?” he demanded.


“Wonderful sight!” murmured Toad. “The _real_ way to travel!”


“O _stop_ being a fool, Toad!” cried the Mole.


“And to think I never _knew_ !” continued the Toad. “But now that I do,

what dust clouds shall soon spring up behind me!”


“What are we to do with him?” asked the Mole of the Rat.


“Nothing at all,” replied the Rat firmly. “You see, I know him too well.

He is now **possessed** . Never mind him. Let’s go and see what there is

to be done about the cart.”


A careful inspection showed them that the cart was in a hopeless **state** .


The Rat knotted the horse’s reins over his back and took him by the

head, carrying the bird cage in the other hand. “Come on!” he said

grimly to the Mole. “It’s five or six miles to the nearest town, and we

shall just have to walk.”


“But what about Toad?” asked the Mole anxiously.


“O, _bother_ Toad,” said the Rat. “I’ve done with him!” ~~This is a British~~

~~way of saying, “Forget about Toad; I’m done with him!”~~


**Show Image U1.L3.6**
Mole, Rat, and Toad regroup


They had not proceeded very far on

their way, however, when there was a

pattering of feet behind them, and Toad

caught them up. ~~This is a British way of~~

~~saying Toad caught up with them.~~


“Now, look here, Toad!” said the Rat sharply. “As soon as we get to

the town, you’ll have to go straight to the police station to lodge a


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


complaint. And then you’ll have to make arrangements to have the

cart **mended** .”


“Police station! Complaint!” murmured Toad. “Me, _complain_ of that

heavenly vision that has saved me! _Mend the cart_ ! I’ve done with

carts forever!”


The Rat turned from him in despair. “You see!” he said to the Mole,

addressing him across Toad’s head. “He’s quite hopeless.”


On reaching the town they left the horse at a stable, and gave what

directions they could about the cart. They went home by train and

escorted Toad to his house. Then they got out their boat from the

boathouse, and set off for home.


The following evening the Mole was sitting on the bank fishing, when the

Rat, who had been chatting to friends, came strolling along to find him.

“Heard the news?” he said. “Toad went up to town and ordered a large and

very expensive motorcar.” ~~What do you think is going to happen next?~~

**68**



Why do authors use themes?


» to help guide the story


Check for Understanding


**Inferential.** How do the characters demonstrate the themes of
friendship/loyalty, responsibility, and irresponsibility in today’s
Read-Aloud?


» Answers may vary, but may include the following: friendship/

loyalty—Rat taking Mole to call on Toad; Rat agreeing to travel with

Toad because he worries about Toad traveling on his own, and

camping on the commons; responsibility/irresponsibility—Rat and

Mole taking care of the work on the trip; Rat and Mole taking care

of the wrecked caravan, the horse, and Toad after the car incident;

Toad not helping on the trip; Toad not caring about the wreck.


4. **Evaluative.** Close your eyes and imagine one of the settings from this

Read-Aloud. In what season does the Read-Aloud take place? ~~**[TEKS 3.6.D ]**~~


» summer


Describe what you see, hear, and smell, and be sure to include elements

that demonstrate the season.


» Answers may vary.


5. **Inferential.** Describe Toad and Toad Hall. Be sure to use adjectives and

other words from the story.


» Toad: not very clever, boastful, fun, generous, a nice animal, irresponsible,

wasteful, self-centered, etc.; Toad Hall: old, dignified, big, red brick, etc.


How is Toad personified?


» He wears a suit; he lives in a nice house; he talks; he buys things; etc.


6. **Evaluative.** Compare and contrast Toad’s reaction with Mole’s and Rat’s

after they all see the motorcar and the caravan wrecks.


» Toad’s state is dreamlike, spellbound, and fascinated. He’s possessed and

practically in a trance, and isn’t even worried or upset about the state of the

wrecked caravan. Toad seems ready to walk away from the wreck without doing

anything about it. Rat and Mole are upset, frustrated, and angry at Toad because

he doesn’t seem to care about the wreck the motorcar has made of his caravan,


**TEKS 3.6.D** Create mental images to deepen understanding.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


or how their trip is ruined. Rat and Mole feel a sense of responsibility to take care

of the horse and the wrecked caravan, as well as help take care of Toad. Toad

behaves in an irresponsible way, and doesn’t seem to care.


7. **Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ What does Toad think about motorcars? What

clues in the story tell you what Toad thinks and what he might be planning to

do next?


» Toad thinks that motorcars are amazing and the real way to travel. He acts like he’s

in a trance and keeps making the “pup-pup” sound. He likes the idea of how fast they

can go. It’s likely Toad is planning to get his own motorcar, because he doesn’t seem to

care about telling the police about the accident, or about having the caravan mended.


~~**WORD WORK: STATE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _state_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity for
students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You may
review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “A careful inspection showed them that the cart
was in a hopeless _state_ .”


3. Say the word _state_ with me.


4. The word _state_ can mean a number of things. In fact, the word _state_ can be
a noun or a verb. As a noun, _state_ has several meanings. The way it is used in
today’s Read-Aloud, _state_ means the physical or emotional shape or condition
something is in. Can you think of any other meanings for the word _state_ ? How
about a _state_ in the United States? The word _state_ refers to other countries or
governments. As a verb, _state_ also means to express something in words, or to
declare something like a law. Today we’re going to focus on the word _state_ as it
was used in today’s Read-Aloud to mean the condition something is in.


5. The state of the kitchen floor was filthy after Zeus, our dog, came running
into the back door of the house after rolling in a mud puddle.


6. Can you come up with a sentence that uses the word _state_ to mean the

Challenge


Based on Rat's response,
how do you think he feels
about the Wild Wood? Give
a reason from the story to
support your answer.



~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students, “Who can name the four seasons of the year?” Have them
name a few characteristics of each season.


 - Encourage students to think about how the changing seasons affect animals
and plants.


 - Ask students which seasons have not yet occurred in _The Wind in the Willows_
and which seasons will come next.


» fall, winter


 - Talk with students about what happens in nature during the fall and
winter seasons.


 - Ask students to explain the difference between dialogue and narration.


 - Ask students to recall what perspective is. Remind students that perspective
is how someone sees or experiences something.


 - Remind students that perspective is a literary tool, like dialogue and
narration, that lets the reader know from whose experience we are learning
more about the story.


 - Remind students that perspective, like dialogue, can shift from one character
to another.


 - Tell them to listen carefully to today’s Read-Aloud for a shift in perspective.
Also tell them to listen carefully and think about the themes discussed in the
previous lesson.


 - Share with students the title of this chapter, “The Wild Wood.” Ask students
to describe what they see in the image. Ask them if they remember the
conversation Rat and Mole had about the Wild Wood in the first Read-Aloud.
If students don’t remember, read the following excerpt to them.


**Show Image U1.L1.5**
Mole and Rat on the river talking about
the Wild Wood


“What lies over there?” asked the Mole,

waving a paw towards a background

of woodland that darkly framed the

water-meadows on one side of the river.


“W-e-ll,” replied the Rat hesitantly, “that’s the Wild Wood. We don’t go

there too often.”



Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**84**


“Are there scary creatures there?” Mole asked, trying not to tremble.


“The squirrels are all right,” Rat replied. “And the rabbits—some of

’em, but rabbits are a mixed lot. And then there’s Badger, of course.

He lives right in the heart of it; wouldn’t live anywhere else, either.

Dear old Badger! Nobody interferes with him.”


“Why, who should interfere with him?” asked the Mole.


“Well, of course, there are others,” explained the Rat in a hesitating

sort of way.


“Weasels, stoats, foxes, and so on. They’re all right in a way; I’m very

good friends with them; pass the time of day when we meet, but you

can’t trust them, and that’s a fact.”


~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD: (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L4.1**
Mole unsuccessfully trying to convince
Rat to go with him to visit Mr. Badger


The Mole had long wanted to meet the

Badger, but the Water Rat always had

a reason to **postpone** the occasion.


“Badger’ll turn up some day or other,” the Rat would say.


“Couldn’t you ask him to dinner?” said the Mole.


“He wouldn’t come,” replied the Rat simply.


“Well, then, supposing we go and call on _him_ ?” suggested the Mole.


“O, he wouldn’t like that at all,” said the Rat, quite alarmed. “Besides,

he lives in the middle of the Wild Wood.”


“Well, supposing he does like it,” said the Mole. “You told me the Wild

Wood was all right.”


Lesson 4 The Wild Wood
**85**


“I know, so it is,” replied the Rat **evasively** . “But he wouldn’t be at

home at this time of year anyhow.”


The Mole had to be content with this. Summer had left, taking the

warmth and sweet fragrances with it. The autumn and winter days

brought cold winds and glistening frost. No one thought about boating,

and so with time to ponder, the Mole began to think once more of Badger.


In the wintertime the Rat slept a great deal. He retired early and rose

late. Consequently, the Mole had plenty of spare time on his hands.

One afternoon, while the Rat rested in his armchair before the fire, he

decided he would explore the Wild Wood, and perhaps meet Mr. Badger.


**Show Image U1.L4.2**
Mole sets out on his own to visit
Mr. Badger in the Wild Wood


It was a cold, still afternoon when he

slipped out of the warm parlor. The

country lay bare and leafless around

him. The Mole liked the country like this, stripped of its finery. And so,

with great cheerfulness of spirit he pushed on towards the Wild Wood.


There was nothing to alarm him at first. Then, as his journey

progressed, he moved into a shadowy world in which trees crouched

nearer and the holes in various tree trunks gaped like hideous

mouths. The dusk descended steadily.


Then the faces began.


It was over his shoulder that he first thought he saw a face. When he

turned and confronted it, the thing had vanished.


He quickened his pace. He passed another hole, and a little narrow face

flashed up.


If he could only get away from the holes, he thought, there would be

no more faces. He swung off the path and plunged into the untrodden

places of the wood. ~~If Mole plunged into the untrodden places, that~~


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**86**


~~means he went deeply into the parts of the wood that were off the~~

~~trail and not walked on.~~


Then the whistling began.


Very faint it was, when first he heard it; but somehow it made him

hurry forward.


Then the pattering began.


He thought it was only falling leaves at first. Then as it grew he knew

it was the pat-pat-pat of little feet. The Mole began to run. He ran up

against things; he fell over things. At last he took refuge in the

hollow of an old beech tree. Terrified and exhausted, the Mole lay

there trembling.


**Show Image U1.L4.3**
Rat, realizing Mole has gone to visit
Mr. Badger on his own


Meanwhile the Rat, warm and

comfortable, dozed by his fireside. It

was not until a coal in the fire slipped,

and sent up a spurt of flames, that he awoke. He immediately looked

round for his companion.


But the Mole was not there.


He listened for a time. The house seemed very quiet.


Then he called “Moly!” several times, and, receiving no answer, got up

and went out into the hall.


The Mole’s cap was missing from its peg. His Wellington boots were

also gone. ~~Wellington boots are waterproof boots that became~~

~~popular because a famous British man, the Duke of Wellington,~~

~~wore them.~~


The Rat left the house and found the Mole’s tracks leading straight to

the Wild Wood.


Lesson 4 The Wild Wood
**87**


The Rat stood in deep thought. Then he re-entered the house,

strapped a belt round his waist, and shoved a brace of pistols into

it. Finally he picked up a stout cudgel and set off for the Wild Wood.

~~A brace of pistols means two pistols. A cudgel is a club or stick. Why~~

~~do you think Rat is taking these things with him?~~


**Show Image U1.L4.4**
Rat finds Mole in a tree hollow
in the Wild Wood


It was already getting towards dusk

when he reached the wood. As he

moved among the trees, the Rat

looked about for his friend. Here and there wicked little faces popped

out of holes, but vanished immediately at the sight of such a well
armed creature.


The Rat called out to his friend for an hour or more, when at last he

heard a little answering cry. Guided by the sound, he made his way to

an old beech tree with a hole in it. From out of the hole came a **feeble**

voice, saying, “Ratty! Is that really you?”


The Rat crept into the hole, and there he found the Mole. “O Rat!” he

cried, “I’ve been so frightened!”


“O, I quite understand,” said the Rat soothingly. “We riverbankers

hardly ever come here by ourselves.”


“Surely the brave Mr. Toad wouldn’t mind coming here by himself,

would he?” inquired the Mole.


“Old Toad?” said the Rat, laughing **heartily** . “He wouldn’t show his

face here alone for anything!”


The Mole was greatly cheered by the sound of the Rat’s laughter.


“Now then,” said the Rat, “we really must make a start for home.”


“Dear Ratty,” said the poor Mole, “You _must_ let me rest a while longer.”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**88**


“O, all right,” said the Rat, “It’s nearly pitch dark now, and there ought

to be a bit of a moon later.”


So the Mole snuggled down and went to sleep, while the Rat lay,

patiently waiting, with a pistol in his paw.


When at last the Mole woke up, the Rat said, “Now then! I’ll just take a

look outside and see if everything’s quiet, and then we really must be off.”


He went to the entrance and put his head out.


“What’s up, Ratty?” asked the Mole.


“ _Snow_ is up,” replied the Rat briefly; “or rather, _down_ .”


The Mole came and crouched beside him, and, looking out, saw that a

gleaming carpet of fine powder was springing up everywhere.


“Well, it can’t be helped,” said the Rat. “We must make a start. The

worst of it is, I don’t exactly know where we are. And now this snow

makes everything look so very different.”


**Show Image U1.L4.5**
Mole and Rat lost on a snowy night
in the Wild Wood


It did indeed. Nevertheless, they set

out bravely.


An hour or two later, they realized that

they were lost. They sat down on a fallen tree trunk to rest.


“We can’t sit here very long,” said the Rat. “The snow will soon be too

deep for us to wade through.” He peered about him and considered.

“Look here,” he went on, “there’s a dell down there in front of us. Let’s

make our way down into that, and try and find some sort of shelter.”


So once more they plodded onward. As they searched for a corner

that was dry, the Mole tripped and fell forward on his face.

**L4.2 (Door Scraper)**



“O my leg!” he cried. “O my poor shin!”


“Poor old Mole!” said the Rat kindly.


“You don’t seem to be having much luck today. Let’s have a look at the leg.”


“I must have tripped over a hidden branch or a stump,” said the

Mole miserably.


“It’s a very clean cut,” said the Rat, examining it. “It looks as if it was

made by a sharp edge of something made of metal.”


“Well, never mind what done it,” said the Mole, forgetting his grammar

in his pain. “It hurts just the same, whatever done it.” ~~Mole is not~~

~~using good grammar. What is the correct way to say this?~~


But the Rat, after carefully tying up the leg with his handkerchief, was

busy scraping in the snow. He scratched and shoveled while the Mole

waited impatiently.


Suddenly the Rat cried, “Hooray!”


“What _have_ you found, Ratty?” asked the Mole.


“Come and see!” said the delighted Rat.


The Mole hobbled up to the spot and had a good look.


“Well,” he said at last, slowly, “I _see_ it right enough. A doorscraper!

Well, what of it?” ~~A door-scraper is a small metal frame located near~~

~~a front door, on which people can scrape the mud off their shoes~~

~~before entering a house.~~


“But don’t you see what it _means_ ?” cried the Rat.


“Of course I see what it means,” replied the Mole. “It means that

some _very_ careless person has left his door-scraper lying about in the

middle of the Wild Wood!”


“O, dear!” cried the Rat, in despair. “Here, stop arguing and come and

dig!” And he set to work again and made the snow fly in all directions.



Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**90**


After some further effort a very shabby doormat lay exposed to view.


“There, what did I tell you?” exclaimed the Rat.


“Absolutely nothing,” replied the Mole, with perfect truthfulness. “You

seem to have found another piece of **domestic** litter.”


“Do—you—mean—to—say,” cried the excited Rat, “that this doormat

doesn’t _tell_ you anything?”


“Really, Rat,” said the Mole. “Who ever heard of a doormat _telling_ anyone

anything? They simply don’t do it. Doormats know their place.”


“Now look here, you—you thick-headed beast,” replied the Rat, really

angrily. “Keep digging if you want to sleep dry and warm tonight!”


**Show Image U1.L4.6**
At long last at Mr. Badger’s front door


The Rat, using his cudgel, attacked

a snowbank with great ferocity. The

Mole scraped busily, too. Some ten

minutes later, the Rat’s cudgel struck

something that sounded hollow. He called the Mole to come and help

him. Before long their efforts were rewarded.


For there in the side of a snowbank stood a little door. An iron bell
pull hung by the side. Below the bell, on a small brass plate, were the

moonlit words _Mr. Badger_ . ~~A bell-pull is an old-fashioned doorbell.~~

~~Pulling on the bell-pull causes bells inside the house connected to~~

~~the pull to ring, letting the homeowners know someone is at the front~~

~~door. (Point to the bell-pull in the image.)~~


The Mole fell backwards on the snow. “Rat!” he cried, “you’re a

wonder! You knew that if there was a door-scraper there was bound

to be a doormat. If I only had your head, Ratty—”


Lesson 4 The Wild Wood
**91**


“But as you haven’t,” interrupted the Rat. “I suppose you’re going to

sit on the snow all night and _talk_ ? Get up at once and hang onto that

bell-pull while I hammer!” ~~Do you think Mr. Badger is at home?~~

small group. Circulate and listen to students use the focus pattern in a spoken
sentence. Give feedback on pronunciation/accuracy of use.


~~**DICTATION (15 MIN.)**~~


                  - Tell students they are to write the word you say. Read the first word, use
it in a sentence, and then read the word only once more, allowing time for
students to write.


                 - Remind students to use their best cursive handwriting. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


                 - Follow the procedure with each of these words.


1. sailboat 4. weekend


2. tiptoe 5. beanbag


3. rescue


                  - After all of the words have been called out, tell students that you will now show
them the correct spelling for each word so they can correct each other's work.
Have students exchange their work with partners. Say, "I'm going to write the
correct spellings on the board. You're going to help your partner find and fix
mistakes." After each word, pause and have students repeat it. Say, "Ask your
partner, 'Did I spell it right?' Then check your partner's work by comparing it to
the board. Mark any mistakes, and write the correct spelling." Have students
follow the steps with their partners, clarifying the directions as necessary.

For a long time, all was well. Each day the king would hunt, fish, and eat.
Each night he slept peacefully in his bed.


Months passed. Then one snowy winter morning, there came the sound of
thunder. Except it was not thunder. It was the thunderous cry of a troll.

bad cold. His nose was swollen and red.


“What kept you?” asked the king. “Did you not hear the sound of the troll?”


_“Doe,_ your _dajesty,_ ” said Sir Gus, “I did _dot._ I have a _dold_ in my _doze,_ ” replied
Sir Gus.


“Well it must have stopped up your ears, too!” said the king. “Hear me,
knights! I am concerned. We must do something to stop this monstrous
troll! We must keep this loathsome beast from eating all of the people in my
kingdom! Who has a plan?”

Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**100**


“If I may, your majesty,” said the knight known as Sir Tom, “I know that trolls
are scared of fire. We could make a fire near the troll’s home and scare it.”


“I like it!” said the king. “See that it is done!”


Eleven of the knights went to get torches. Then they rode off to find
the troll.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


                 - Remind students that they have been learning about themes.


                 - Ask students if they remember what a theme is. _(a literary tool, a broad idea_
_that comes up many times over the course of a story)_


                 - Be sure to use the term _literary tool_ when talking to students about themes.


                 - Ask students what themes they have heard so far in _The Wind in the Willows_ .
_(friendship/loyalty, responsibility, irresponsibility)_


                  - Tell students that today they will be introduced to another theme: hospitality.
Hospitality is treating guests well and being warm, welcoming, and friendly
toward them. Explain that a hospitable person is someone who is very
attentive to guests’ or friends’ needs. This means that they always make sure
that their guests or friends are comfortable and have everything they need,
often anticipating what these things may be.


                 - Ask students if they can think of any examples of hospitality demonstrated
in the story so far. _(Rat shares his boat and picnic lunch with Mole; Rat invites_
_Mole into his home to spend the night after the rowing incident. He makes a_
_nice fire, they have a cheerful meal, and Rat makes Mole feel right at home._
_Toad also displays hospitality by inviting Rat and Mole into his caravan and_
_sharing his food and beds with them.)_

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L5.1**
Mr. Badger


Rat and Mole waited patiently for what

seemed a very long time. At last there

was the noise of a bolt sliding back, and

then the door opened a few inches.


“Who is it?” said a rather gruff voice.


“Oh, Badger,” cried the Rat, “It’s me, Rat, and my friend Mole, and

we’ve lost our way in the snow.”


“What, Ratty, my dear little man!” exclaimed the Badger. “Come along

in, both of you.”


The two animals tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get

inside. The Badger, who wore a long dressing gown, carried a flat

candlestick in his paw. “This is not the sort of night for small animals

to be out,” he said paternally. “But come into the kitchen. There’s a

fire there, and supper, too.”


Once there they could dimly see other long tunnel-like passages

branching off in various directions. But there were doors in the hall

as well. One of these the Badger flung open, and at once they found

themselves in a large fire-lit kitchen.


The floor was well-worn red brick, and on the wide hearth burnt a fire

of logs. A couple of high-backed settles were facing each other on

either side of the fire. In the middle of the room there stood a long

table with benches on either side. ~~Settles are high-backed benches.~~

Badger bandages Mole’s leg


The kindly Badger guided them to one

of the settles, and bade them remove

their wet coats and boots. Then he

fetched them dressing gowns and

slippers. He bathed the Mole’s shin with warm water and dressed

the cut.


When they were **thoroughly** warm, the Badger **summoned** them to

the table to eat a delicious meal.


As they dined, the Badger sat in his armchair at the head of the table,

and listened as the animals told their story.


When supper was finished, the Badger said heartily, “Now then, tell

us the news from your part of the world. How’s old Toad going on?”


“Oh, from bad to worse,” said the Rat gravely. “Another smashup.”


“How many has he had?” inquired the Badger gloomily.


“Smashes, or machines?” asked the Rat. “Oh, well, after all, it’s the

same thing—with Toad. This is the seventh.”


“He’s been in the hospital three times,” put in the Mole; “and as for

the fines he’s had to pay, it’s simply awful to think of.”


“Yes, and that’s part of the trouble,” continued the Rat. “Toad’s rich,

we all know; but he’s not a millionaire. He’ll either be killed or ruined.

Badger, we’re his friends—oughtn’t we to do something?”


The Badger thought for a while. “Now look here!” he said at last. “Of

course you know I can’t do anything _now_ .”


His two friends agreed, quite understanding his point. No animal,

according to the rules of animal etiquette, is ever expected to do

anything heroic during the off-season of winter. ~~Etiquette means~~

~~having good manners. In other words, animals with good manners~~



Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**108**


~~do not expect each other to help or act like heroes during the harsh~~

~~winter season, because certain animals, like the badger, hibernate~~

~~during the winter.~~


“Very well then!” continued the Badger. “ _But_, when once the year has

really turned, if not before— _you_ know!——”


Both animals nodded gravely. _They_ knew!


“Well, _then_,” went on the Badger, “then we’ll bring Toad back to

reason. We’ll—you’re asleep, Rat!”


“Not me!” said the Rat, waking up with a jerk.


“He’s been asleep two or three times since supper,” said the Mole,

laughing. He himself was feeling quite lively. Badger’s house suited

him and made him feel at home; whereas the Rat, who slept every

night in a bedroom beside a river, naturally felt the **atmosphere**

quite oppressive.


“Well, it’s time we were all in bed,” said the Badger, getting up and

fetching flat candlesticks. “Come along, you two, and I’ll show you to

your quarters. And take your time tomorrow morning—breakfast at

any hour you please!”


He **conducted** the two animals to a long room with two little white

beds in it. Moments later, the two white beds contained one Mole

and one Rat.


**Show Image U1.L5.3**
Breakfast at Badger’s


The two tired animals came down

to breakfast very late the next

morning. When they did emerge they

found a bright fire burning in the

kitchen, and two young hedgehogs sitting on a bench at the table

eating oatmeal.

Lesson 5 Mr. Badger
**109**


“Where have you two youngsters come from?” said the Rat

pleasantly. “Lost your way in the snow?”


“Yes, Sir,” said the elder of the two hedgehogs. “Me and little Billy

here, we was trying to find our way to school and we lost ourselves.

At last we found Mr. Badger’s back door.” ~~How would you correct the~~

~~grammar of these two little hedgehogs?~~


“I understand,” said the Rat, cutting himself some rashers ~~or sliced~~

~~portions~~ from a side of bacon, while the Mole dropped some eggs

into a saucepan. “And what’s the weather like outside?”


“O, terrible bad, Sir,” said the hedgehog.


“Where’s Mr. Badger?” inquired the Mole.


“The master’s gone into his study, Sir,” replied the hedgehog, “and he

said as how he was going to be particular busy this morning, and on

no account was he to be disturbed.”


This explanation, of course, was thoroughly understood. The animals

well knew that Badger, having eaten a hearty breakfast, had **retired**

to his study. Once there he had settled himself in an arm-chair, and

was being “busy” in the usual way at this time of the year.


The front doorbell clanged loudly, and the Rat sent Billy, the smaller

hedgehog, to see who it might be. Presently, Billy returned with

the Otter.


“Thought I should find you here,” said the Otter. “They were all in a

great state of alarm along River Bank when you didn’t return home last

night. But I knew that when people were in any fix they went to Badger.

My! It was fine, coming through the snow as the red sun was rising! I

was about halfway when I came across a rabbit sitting on a stump. He

told me that Mole had been seen in the Wild Wood last night.”


“Weren’t you at all—er—nervous?” asked the Mole.


“Nervous?” The Otter showed a gleaming set of strong white teeth

as he laughed. “Never! Here, Mole, fry me some slices of ham. I’m

frightfully hungry.”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**110**


So the Mole, having cut some slices of ham, set the hedgehogs to

fry it, and returned to his own breakfast, while the Otter and the Rat

chatted about the river bank.


A plate of fried ham had just been cleared and sent back for more,

when the Badger entered. He greeted them all. “It must be getting on

for luncheon time,” he remarked to the Otter. “You must be hungry.”


“Indeed!” replied the Otter. “The sight of these greedy young

hedgehogs stuffing themselves makes me feel famished.”


The hedgehogs looked timidly up at Mr. Badger, but were too shy to

say anything.


“Here, you two youngsters, be off home,” said the Badger kindly. “I’ll

send someone with you to show you the way.”


**Show Image U1.L5.4**
Lunch at Badger’s


Presently the others sat down

to luncheon together. The Mole

found himself placed next to

Mr. Badger, and so took the

opportunity to tell Badger how comfortable and home-like it all felt

to him. “Once well underground,” he said, “you know exactly where

you are.”


The Badger simply beamed on him. “There’s no security, or peace,

except underground.”


The Mole agreed, and the Badger in consequence got very friendly

with him. “When lunch is over,” he said, “I’ll take you round this little

place of mine.”


After luncheon, the Badger lighted a lantern and bade the Mole follow

him. Crossing the hall, they passed down one of the principal tunnels,

and the wavering light of the lantern gave glimpses on either side


Lesson 5 Mr. Badger
**111**


of rooms both large and small. The Mole was staggered at the size.

“How on earth, Badger,” he said at last, “did you ever find time and

strength to do all this? It’s astonishing.”


“It _would_ be astonishing,” said the Badger simply, “if I _had_ done it.

But as a matter of fact I did none of it. You see, long ago, on the spot

where the Wild Wood stands now, there was a city—a city of people.

Here, where we are standing, they lived. They were a powerful people,

and great builders.”


“But what has become of them all?” asked the Mole.


“Who can tell?” said the Badger. “People come—they stay for a while—

and they go. But we remain. There were badgers here long before that

same city ever came to be. And now there are badgers here again.”


When they got back to the kitchen, they found the Rat walking up

and down. The underground atmosphere was getting on his nerves.

“Come along, Mole,” he said as soon as he caught sight of them. “We

must get off while it’s daylight.”


“It’ll be all right, my fine fellow,” said the Otter. “I’m coming along

with you. And if there’s a head that needs to be punched, you can

confidently rely upon me to punch it.”


“You really needn’t fret, Ratty,” added the Badger. “My passages run

further than you think. When you are ready to go, you shall leave by

one of my short cuts.”


**Show Image U1.L5.5**
Badger’s shortcut


Before long, the Badger led the way

along a damp tunnel that wound and

dipped for a weary distance. At last

daylight began to show itself through

tangled growth near the mouth of the passage. The Badger, bidding

them goodbye, pushed them hurriedly through the opening,

and hastily made good again the creepers and brushwood that


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**112**


surrounded it. ~~Creepers are vines, and brushwood is a collection~~

~~of broken branches and twigs. Badger uses the creepers and~~

~~brushwood to hide the opening to his home.~~


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.6.C; TEKS 3.8.B**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Were your predictions correct about whether Mr. Badger shows

hospitality to Rat and Mole? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


Check for Understanding


**Inferential.** When does the theme of hospitality come up in today’s ReadAloud? Give two or three examples as demonstrated through the characters.

» Mr. Badger welcomes Rat and Mole into his home very late at

night; he brings them dry, warm clothes; he bandages Mole’s leg;

he conducts Mole and Rat to sleep in his guest beds; he welcomes

and feeds two hedgehogs that become lost in the snow; etc.


2. **Inferential.** From whose perspective is today’s Read-Aloud told?


» Mole’s


Describe Mr. Badger’s home.


» warm, underground, cozy, hidden, welcoming, or oppressive—according to Rat


3. **Inferential.** You learn through dialogue that both Badger and Mole have

underground homes. Why do they like living underground?


» won’t be bothered by other people; secure; don’t need to worry about the

weather; won’t break the way a house can; etc.


4. **Evaluative.** Describe the atmosphere of Badger’s underground tunnels.


» dark, damp, warm


In nature, would Mole feel at home or out of place in this environment?


» at home


Why?


» because in nature moles live underground.


**TEKS 3.6.C** Make and correct or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structures;
**TEKS 3.8.B** Explain the relationships among the major and minor characters.


Lesson 5 Mr. Badger
**113**


5. **Evaluative.** In the Read-Aloud, you heard that Mr. Badger retired to his

study and was “‘busy’ in the usual way at this time of the year.” What do you

think this means?


» Animals in nature, such as badgers, are less active in the winter because they

hibernate. So, Badger is joking that he will be “busy” sleeping.


What are some things animals do to prepare for the winter?


» gather food and store it to last for the winter


6. **Inferential.** In the Read-Aloud, you heard that Rat is thoroughly ready to

leave Badger’s house. Why do you think this is?


» He is afraid it will get dark, he doesn’t want to spend another night in the Wild

Wood, and he doesn’t like being underground because he’s a water rat and it’s

somewhat against his nature.


7. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ In _The Wind in the Willows_ so far, you have

heard about the River Bank and the Wild Wood. How would you compare

and contrast them to tell how they are similar and different?


» Answers may vary.


~~**WORD WORK: SUMMONED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _summoned_ on the board in cursive and provide an
opportunity for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being
discussed. You may review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “When they were thoroughly warm, Badger
_summoned_ them to the table to eat a delicious meal.”


3. Say the word _summoned_ with me.


4. To be _summoned_ means to be called, beckoned, or sent for.


5. In the stories of Greek mythology, the mythical Greek god Zeus summoned
the mythical Olympian gods and goddesses to Mount Olympus through
Hermes the messenger.


6. Have you ever been summoned? Who summoned you? Why were you
summoned? Be sure to use the word _summoned_ when you tell about it. (Ask two
or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to
make complete sentences: “I was summoned when . . .” or “summoned for . . .”)


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _summoned_ ?


                  - Use a Brainstorming/Acting activity for follow-up. Directions: Turn to your
partner and brainstorm the kinds of words, phrases, or actions that show

Themes Description



Lesson 5 Mr. Badger
**115**


                 - Write the following words on the board in cursive and read them as you write:
_middle_, _simple_, _castle_, and _little_ .


                   - Circle ‘le’ at the end of each word. Point out to students that this pattern or
combination of letters represents a new syllable pattern. The ‘e’ is used with a
syllable ending in a consonant ‘le’ pattern, as in _mid_ **dle**, _sim_ **ple**, _cas_ **tle**, _lit_ **tle** .


                  - Point out to students that when a syllable ends in ‘le’, they should look at how
many consonants come before the ‘le’. If there are two consonants, then the
word is chunked into syllables by dividing between the consonants.


1. mid dle 2. sim ple 3. cas tle 4. lit tle


                  - Point out that in each of the previous words, the first syllable has the CVC
pattern and the vowels in each syllable are short.


                 - Write the following words on the board in cursive and read them as use write:
_stable_, c _radle_, _idle_, _able_, and _maple_ .


                  - Circle the consonant ‘le’ at the end of each word. Point out to students that
this combination forms the last syllable in the word and that there is a
consonant before the ‘le’.


                  - Point out to students that in the following words, there is only one
consonant before ‘le’. In most instances when there is only one consonant
before the ‘le’, we divide before the consonant.


1. sta ble 2. cra dle 3. i dle 4. ma ple


                  - Point out that the first syllable in the previous words ends with the /ae/ or
/ie/ sound.


                  - Have students share the two rules they learned for dividing words with ‘le’
with a partner. After both partners share, have each student use a word with
‘le’ in a sentence.


**Note:** Distribute the decodable passage, “Summary of ‘Mr. Badger,’” that
you prepared in advance to practice decoding words with the consonant
‘le’ pattern. After students decode the passage, provide immediate and
corrective feedback as needed.


~~**ENCODING ACTIVITY (15 MIN.)**~~


                   - Tell students that they will practice the skills they are learning to read
multisyllable words by participating in an encoding activity. You will use the
cards you prepared in advance.

Lesson 5 Mr. Badger
**117**


                  - Tell students that today, they will read a few paragraphs at a time to
themselves to find the answer to a question you will give them. Students will
then share their answers.


~~**PRACTICE STORY: “FIRE!” (25 MIN.)**~~


**Paragraphs 1 and 2**

                  - Tell students to read **paragraphs 1 and 2** to themselves to find the answer
to the question: “Why wasn’t it hard to find the troll?” Give students time to
read the paragraphs silently.


It was not hard to find the troll. Trolls cry when they are hungry. The knights
simply followed the sounds of loud sobs and eating.


As nightfall neared, the knights arrived at the foot of a large hill. The troll
had spent all day eating the rocks and plants on the hill. All that was left on
the hill were some prickly plants and some old, dying trees.


                 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask them
to answer.


» Trolls cry when they are hungry and this troll was hungry. The knights merely

followed the sounds of loud sobs and eating.


                  - Ask, “What was left on the hill they came to?”


» Prickly plants and some old, dying trees were left on the hill after a day of eating.


**Paragraphs 3–5**

                  - Tell students to read **paragraphs 3–5** to themselves to find the answer to
the question: “What was the knights’ plan?” Give students time to read the
paragraphs silently.


Near the top of the hill was a cave. Scary troll sounds were coming from
inside the cave.


The knights met in a grove at the foot of the hill. They knelt down and made
a plan.


“When it is dark we will light our torches,” said Sir Tom. “Then we will creep
up the hill. The sight of the flames will scare the troll and it will go back to its
home beneath the ground.”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**118**


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask them
to answer.


» They decided to wait until dark to light the torches and then creep up the hill. The

sight of the flames would hopefully scare the troll, and it would go back into its

home beneath the ground.


**Paragraphs 6–8**

  - Tell students to read **paragraphs 6–8** to themselves to find the answer to
the question: “What was Sir Ed’s fear?” Give students time to read the
paragraphs silently.


“And what if that plan fails?” asked Sir Ed. “I don’t care to be the troll’s dinner.”


“Well, do you have a better plan?” asked Sir Tom.


Sir Ed said nothing. The other knights were quiet, as well.


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer.


» Sir Ed wondered what would happen if the plan failed. He didn’t want to become

the troll’s dinner.


  - Ask, “Did anyone have another plan?”


» No.

**Paragraphs 9 and 10**

  - Tell students to read **paragraph 9 and 10** to themselves to find the answer
to the question: “Who arrived at that point?” Give students time to read the
paragraphs silently.


At that very moment came the sound of a horse trotting nearby.


“Found you at last!” said Sir Gus as he rode up to the knights. ”So, my fellow
knights, tell me, have you devised a plan of attack to defeat this monstrous troll?”


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer.


» Sir Gus arrived.


  - Ask, “What did he want to know?”


» Sir Gus wanted to know if they had devised a plan to attack and defeat this

monstrous troll.


Lesson 5 Mr. Badger
**119**


**Paragraphs 11–13**

                  - Tell students to read **paragraphs 11–13** to themselves to find the answer to
the question: “What did Sir Tom say was the plan?” Give students time to
read the paragraphs silently.


“Yes, we have!” said Sir Tom. “We have agreed that our bravest knight will
creep up the hill with a torch and frighten the troll away.”


“Splendid idea!” said Sir Gus. “And who is going to attempt this brave deed?”
he asked, looking around.


“You!” said Sir Tom and Sir Ed together.


               - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask
students to answer.


» He said that the bravest knight would creep up the hill with a torch and frighten

the troll away.


                  - Ask, “Was that different from the plan they devised earlier?”


» Yes, this asked for a specific knight to carry the torch instead of all of the knights

creeping up the hill.


                 - Ask,“Who did the 11 knights think was the bravest knight and the one to
carry out the plan?”


» They thought Sir Gus would be the brave knight to attempt the deed.

**Paragraphs 14–17**


                   - Tell students to read **paragraphs 14–17** to themselves to find the answer to
the question: “What was Sir Gus’s response to the charge?” Give students time
to read the paragraph silently.


“But, but . . . well . . . I . . . er . . . um . . .,” said a reluctant Sir Gus.


It was no good trying to get out of it. Sir Tom handed Sir Gus a lit torch.
Then he pointed at the cave.


Sir Gus went up the hill alone. By the time he reached the mouth of the
cave, it was pitch black. The lit torch cast shadows on the ground.


Sir Gus looked around him. He saw shadows dancing on the ground. He was
afraid. But he pressed on.

**120**


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask them
to answer.


» “But, but . . . well . . . I . . . er . . . um . . .,”


  - Ask,“Why is he talking funny?”


» He was reluctant but went up the hill with the torch anyway.


**Paragraphs 18–21**

  - Tell students to read **paragraphs 18–21** to themselves to find the answer to
the question: “What did Sir Gus hear and see when he got to the mouth of
the cave?” Give students time to read the paragraphs silently.


From inside the cave came alarming troll sounds.


“Snnniccck, Snnnuummm, Guffumffffff!”


The troll was eating bits of rock with its sharp teeth, then spitting out the

bits it did not like.


Sir Gus approached the cave. Small pieces of rock came flying out. Some
of them landed at Sir Gus’s feet. Sir Gus jumped back, trying to avoid the
pieces of rock.


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer.


» Sir Gus heard alarming troll sounds and saw bits of rock the troll spit out.


**Paragraphs 22–25**

  - Tell students to read **paragraphs 22–25** to themselves to find the answer to
the question: “What else did Sir Gus hear?” Give students time to read the
paragraphs silently.


Suddenly there was a thumping sound. Thump! Thump! Thump! The troll
was coming out of the cave!


As the troll got closer, the sounds got louder.


“SNNNNICCCK, SNNNUUUUMMMM, GUFFUMFFFFFF!”


Sir Gus was afraid. He started to feel weak in the knees. At last he fainted.

His torch fell to the ground. It landed on some dry, prickly plants near the
mouth of the cave. The plants caught on fire. The flames got bigger quickly.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Speaking and Listening**

                  - Identify the following Digital Flip Book images in the online materials to
project during the Read-Aloud: U1.L6.1-4.


**Lesson Format for Lessons 6–10**

                  - The primary purpose of the next five lessons is to assess all students to
determine placement and instruction in the appropriate level of materials.
Today, all students will read the first selection of the Silent Reading
Assessment (Activity Page 6.1) and will answer comprehension questions
specific to the selection. Students who answer five or more comprehension
questions correctly will read the second selection of the Silent Reading
Assessment (Activity Page 6.2) and will answer questions specific to it.


                  - Each subsequent lesson will also start with students, though not all students,
reading selections silently and answering questions. These selections and
questions are located in students’ Activity Book. Depending on the student,
this silent reading and question answering may take from 15 to 30 minutes
to complete. We have provided additional worksheets that can be done
independently each day for those who finish more rapidly.


                 - See the Flow Chart for Placement Assessment Administration found at the end
of this lesson for an overview.


                  - Students will turn in their Silent Reading Assessments to you upon
completion. These should be scored as soon as possible to determine which
students will continue with which assessments during subsequent lessons this
week. You will follow the same procedure each day this week, i.e., students who
successfully complete the daily Silent Reading Assessment will continue to
read a new selection and answer questions the next day.


                   - If a student does not successfully complete a particular Silent Reading
Assessment, you will give him or her an individually administered Word Reading
in Isolation Assessment that day or the next day in order to more accurately
determine individual reading strengths and weaknesses for placement
consideration. You will begin administering the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment in Lesson 7 to any student who does not successfully complete
“The Bug Hunt” or “The Snake.”


                   - As noted before, throughout all lessons this week, we have provided Activity
Pages with instructional activities that students should be able to complete
independently to ensure that you have adequate time to assess students
individually.


                  - Feel free to provide additional independent activities for students, including
reading trade books, independent writing, or doing other activities that can
be completed quietly with little or no teacher assistance.

                 - Remind students that over the past several days, they have been learning
about the themes in _The Wind in the Willows_ .


                 - Review the term _themes_ with students briefly.


                 - Use the Themes Chart to review the themes and where they appear in
each chapter.


                  - Tell students to pay attention to see if they recognize themes in this ReadAloud.


                  - Review the plot of _The Wind in the Willows_ with students. Have students
summarize the plot thus far, using the flipbook images below as reference:


                        - U1.L1.5: Mole and Rat on the river talking about the Wild Wood (Water Rat
and Mole meet and become friends.)


                        - U1.L2.5: At Rat’s home before the hearth (Mole stays with Rat.)

                        - U1.L3.5: A change in plans (Mole, Rat, and Toad go on a disastrous trip on
the Open Road, and return home.)


                        - U1.L4.4: Rat finds Mole in a tree hollow in the Wild Wood (Mole goes to the
Wild Wood to find Mr. Badger and gets lost. Rat finds him.)

night with him.)


                        - U1.L5.5: Badger’s shortcut (Mr. Badger shows Mole and Rat a shortcut
from the Wild Wood and back to the River Bank.) Remind students that
recently they heard more about Badger. Ask students to describe Badger
by asking, “What kind of character is Badger?”


                 - Read the title of the chapter and tell students that Dulce Domum [ _DULL-_ chay
_DOE_ -mum] is Latin for “home sweet home.” Tell students that the phrase
“home sweet home” is similar to the saying “There’s no place like home.”


                 - Ask students what they think this saying means.


» Home is the best place of all.


                 - Ask students when they might use this phrase.


» If they had been away from home and were happy to be coming back.


                 - Ask students if any of them has ever moved from one place or home to
another. Ask, “What was it like? How did moving make you feel?”


                 - Remind students that Mole has been living away from his home for several
months while staying with Rat. Tell students to listen to find out how Mole
feels when he passes through his neighborhood and smells his home.

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L6.1**
Mole smells and remembers
his old home


Not long after their adventures in

the Wild Wood, the Rat and the Mole

found themselves plodding silently

along a country lane. The rapid nightfall of mid-December had

already descended upon them. The Mole was thinking of supper as

he followed obediently behind the Rat, leaving the guidance in the

darkness entirely to him.


As for the Rat, he was walking a little way ahead, as was his habit.

He walked steadily with his shoulders humped, his eyes fixed on the

straight grey road in front of him. This is why he did not notice poor

Mole when suddenly something soft and **subtle,** carried gently upon

the cool night air, caused Mole to stop dead in his tracks.


It was one of these mysterious sensory moments that suddenly

reached Mole in the darkness. It made him tingle through and

through with its familiar appeal, even though he could not clearly

remember what it was. ~~What do you think a sensory moment is?~~

~~As you heard earlier, you use your senses to perceive things. Mole is~~

~~using his senses in this moment to perceive something in the darkness.~~


Having stopped suddenly in the pitch black of the night, his nose

searched hither and thither in an effort to recapture the vague scent

that had so strongly moved him. A moment, and he had caught it

again; and with it this time came **recollection** in fullest flood.


Home! The essence of which had wafted through the air. Why, it

must be quite close by him at that moment, his old home. The one

he had forsaken and never sought again, that day when he first found


Lesson 6 Dulce Domum, Part I
**129**


the river! And now it was sending out its scouts and its messengers

to capture him and bring him in. ~~The phrase “its scouts and its~~

~~messengers” is the author’s way of saying that the scent of Mole’s~~

~~home is acting like scouts looking for Mole, and like messengers~~

~~bringing him a message: Come home!~~ Since his escape on that bright

morning, Mole had hardly given it a thought—so absorbed was he in his

new life, with all its happiness, surprises, and captivating experiences.

Now, with a rush of old memories, how clearly it stood up before him,

in the darkness! Shabby indeed, and small and poorly furnished, and

yet it was his. It was the home he had made for himself, the home he

had been so happy to get back to after his day’s work. And the home

had been happy with him, too, evidently, and was missing him, and

wanted him back.


**Show Image U1.L6.2**
Mole implores Rat to go with him to
his long-abandoned home


The call was clear, the summons was

plain. He must obey it instantly, and

go. “Ratty!” he called, full of joyful

excitement. “Hold on! Come back!”


“Oh, _come_ along, Mole, do!” replied the Rat cheerfully, still plodding along.


“ _Please_ stop, Ratty!” pleaded the poor Mole, in anguish of heart. “You

don’t understand! It’s my home, my old home! I’ve just come across

the smell of it, and it’s close by. I _must_ go to it, I must! Oh, come back,

Ratty! Please, please come back!”


The Rat was by this time very far ahead, too far to hear clearly

what the Mole was calling. He was also too far away to catch the

sharp note of painful appeal in his voice. And he was much taken

up with the weather, for he too could smell something—something

suspiciously like approaching snow.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**130**


“Mole, we mustn’t stop now, really!” he called back. “We’ll come for

it tomorrow, whatever it is you’ve found. But I daren’t stop now—it’s

late, and the snow’s coming on again, and I’m not sure of the way! So

come on quick, there’s a good fellow!” And the Rat pressed forward

on his way without waiting for an answer.


Poor Mole stood alone in the road, his heart torn asunder, and a

big sob gathering somewhere low down inside him. But even under

such a test as this his loyalty to his friend stood firm. Never for a

moment did Mole dream of abandoning Rat. Meanwhile, the wafts

from his old home pleaded, and whispered to him. He dared not tarry

longer within their magic circle. With a wrench that tore his very

heartstrings, he set his face down the road and followed submissively

in the track of the Rat, while faint little smells **reproached** him for his

new friendship and his forgetfulness.


With an effort he caught up to the unsuspecting Rat, who began

chattering cheerfully about what they would do when they got back.

In the midst of his descriptive fervor, the Rat failed to notice his

companion’s silence and despair. At last, however, when they had

gone some considerable way further, he stopped and said kindly,

“Look here, Mole old chap, you seem dead tired. No talk left in you,

and your feet dragging like lead. We’ll sit down for a minute and rest.

The snow has held off so far, and the best part of our journey is over.”


**Show Image U1.L6.3**
Rat comforts a despondent Mole


The Mole rested forlornly on a tree

stump and tried to control himself, for

he felt it surely coming. The sob he

had fought with so long refused to be

beaten. Up and up, it forced its way to the air, and then another; till

poor Mole at last gave up the struggle, and cried freely and helplessly.


Lesson 6 Dulce Domum, Part I
**131**


The Rat, astonished and dismayed at the violence of Mole’s grief,

did not dare to speak for a while. At last he said, very quietly and

sympathetically, “What is it, old fellow? Whatever can be the matter?

Tell us your trouble, and let me see what I can do.” Poor Mole found it

difficult to get any words out between such heavy sobs. “I know it’s

a—shabby, dingy little place,” he sobbed forth at last, brokenly: “not

like—your cozy quarters—or Toad’s beautiful hall—or Badger’s great

house—but it was my own little home—and I was fond of it—and I

went away and forgot all about it—and then I smelt it suddenly—on

the road, when I called and you wouldn’t listen, Rat—and everything

came back to me with a rush—and I _wanted_ it!—O dear, O dear!—And

when you _wouldn’t_ turn back, Ratty—and I had to leave it, though

I was smelling it all the time—I thought my heart would break. We

might have just gone and had one look at it, Ratty—only one look—it

was close by—but you wouldn’t turn back, Ratty, you wouldn’t turn

back! O dear, O dear!”


Recollection brought fresh waves of sorrow, and sobs again took full

charge of him, preventing further speech.


The Rat stared straight in front of him, saying nothing, only patting

Mole gently on the shoulder. After a time he muttered gloomily, “I see

it all now! What a _pig_ I have been! Just a pig—a plain pig!”


He waited till Mole’s sobs became gradually less stormy and more

rhythmical; he waited till at last sniffs were frequent and sobs only

intermittent. Then he rose from his seat, and, remarking carelessly,

“Well, now we’d really better be getting on, old chap!” And with that

Rat set off up the road they had just traveled upon.


“Wherever are you (hic) going to (hic), Ratty?” cried the tearful Mole,

looking up in alarm.


“We’re going to find that home of yours, old fellow,” replied the Rat

pleasantly; “so you had better come along, for it will take some

finding, and we shall want your nose.” ~~Or in other words, Rat needs~~

~~Mole’s strong sense of smell to find the quarters.~~


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**132**


“Oh, come back, Ratty, do!” cried the Mole, getting up and hurrying

after him. “It’s no good, I tell you! It’s too late, and too dark, and the

place is too far off, and the snow’s coming! And—and I never meant

to let you know I was feeling that way about it—it was all an accident

and a mistake! And think of River Bank, and your supper!”


“Hang River Bank, and supper, too!” said the Rat heartily. “I tell you,

I’m going to find this place now, if I stay out all night. So cheer up, old

chap, and take my arm, and we’ll very soon be back there again.”


Still snuffling, pleading, and reluctant, Mole suffered himself to be

dragged back along the road by his companion.


**Show Image U1.L6.4**
Mole searches for his old home


When at last it seemed to the Rat that

they must be nearing that part of the

road where the Mole had been “held

up,” he said, “Now, no more talking.

Business! Use your nose, and give your mind to it.”


They moved on in silence for some little way, when suddenly the

Rat was conscious, through his arm that was linked in Mole’s, of a

faint sort of electric thrill that was passing down that animal’s body.

Instantly he disengaged himself, fell back a pace, and waited.


The signals were coming through!


Mole stood a moment rigid, while his uplifted nose, quivering slightly,

felt the air. ~~What do you look like if you stand in a rigid way? (Have a~~

~~student or two demonstrate what they think it means.)~~


Then a short, quick run forward—a fault—a check—a try back; and

then a slow, steady, confident **advance** .



Support


The phrase “Hang River
Bank, and supper, too”
means forget about River
Bank and supper!



Lesson 6 Dulce Domum, Part I
**133**


The Rat, much excited, kept close to his heels as the Mole, with

something of the air of a sleepwalker, crossed a dry ditch, scrambled

through a hedge, and nosed his way over a field.


Suddenly, without giving warning, Mole dived; but the Rat was on

the alert, and promptly followed him down the tunnel to which his

**unerring** nose had faithfully led him.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


Ask students to identify a theme from today’s Read-Aloud and provide
evidence from the story that supports that theme.


1. **Literal.** In the Read-Aloud today, you heard that Mole and Rat were

returning home after being out all day. On their way back home with Rat

leading the way, and Mole following obediently behind, Mole comes across

something soft and subtle. Describe what Mole notices.


» Mole smells his home. He realizes how much he misses it and wants to see it. Mole

experiences a strong recollection of his home.


2. **Inferential.** Rat initially continues his advance toward his own home

instead of stopping with Mole. Why?


» Rat is moving fast because he wants to be home as quickly as possible, because

he smells snow on the way. He gets so far ahead of Mole that he can’t hear Mole

yelling after him.


3. **Inferential.** When Mole catches up with Rat, Mole breaks down into

tears. Why?


» Because Mole is torn between wanting to see his old home, and his friendship with

Rat. Mole thinks Rat wouldn’t want to go to Mole’s home. Mole feels reproached

for forgetfulness when he smells his long-lost home.


4. **Inferential.** Rat decides to go back and find Mole’s old home, even though

Rat is hungry and cold. Which theme do you think fits in this part of the story?


» Answers may vary, but should include friendship and/or loyalty.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**134**


5. **Evaluative.** How does Mole find his home in all the snow?


» with his unerring nose


Do you think Mole’s excellent sense of smell is an example of personification?


» no


Why or why not?


» Moles, like many animals, really do have an acute sense of smell—much stronger

than humans.


6. **Inferential.** Whose perspective is this Read-Aloud told from?


» Mole’s


How do you know?


» The reader sees everything through Mole’s eyes, knows how he feels, knows what

he’s thinking, sees what he does, etc.


7. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ How would you feel if you were Mole in this

part of the story?


» Answers may vary, but should include examples from the text.


~~**WORD WORK: REPROACHED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _reproached_ on the board in cursive and provide an
opportunity for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being
discussed. You may review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “With a wrench that tore his very heartstrings,
he [the Mole] set his face down the road and followed submissively in the
track of the Rat, while faint little smells _reproached_ him for his new friendship
and his forgetfulness.”


3. Say the word _reproached_ with me.


4. _Reproached_ means scolded, corrected, or expressed disappointment in
someone for a certain behavior.


5. As a baby, James was never _reproached_ for making a mess while eating, but
as he grew older, he learned there were certain rules to follow at the dinner
table.


6. Have you ever reproached someone for behavior that disappointed you?
Have you ever been reproached by someone? Be sure to use the word
_reproached_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences: “I
was reproached for . . .” or “I was reproached once when . . .”)


Lesson 6 Dulce Domum, Part I
**135**


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _reproached_ ?


                  - Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up. Directions: Say, “The opposite of
reproached is _praised_ . I am going to read several sentences. If the person
or animal I describe in the sentence is being reproached, say, ‘That person/
animal is being reproached.’ If the person or animal I describe in the sentence
is not being reproached, but is instead being praised, say, ‘That person/
animal is being praised.’”


1. Jenny received many compliments for her prize-winning science fair project.


» That person is being praised.


2. Luther was scolded for tracking mud throughout the house.


» That person is being reproached.


3. Olivia gave her cat a treat for coming when she was called.


» That animal is being praised.


4. The principal voiced his disappointment to Marc for running in the hallway
when he was supposed to be in class.


» That person is being reproached.


5. Everyone congratulated Jamelle on his beautiful new painting.


» That person is being praised.


6. Lynette spoke sharply to her dog whenever he jumped up on people.


» That animal is being reproached.


                  - Use a Brainstorming/Acting activity for follow-up. Directions: Say, “Turn to
your partner and brainstorm the kinds of words, phrases, or actions that
show someone being summoned. Examples may include the waving of a hand
toward yourself; calling someone’s name; the phrases ‘Come here,’‘Excuse me,’
or ‘Follow me this way’; etc. Practice various gestures with your partner.”


~~**ON STAGE (15 MIN.)**~~


                  - Tell students that they are going to act out today’s Read-Aloud. Ask students
what characters will be needed. (Mole, Rat) Then, designate students to
be the characters. You may have several students act as Mole and Rat to
increase active participation. Ask students what settings will be needed, and
designate locations in the classroom for the various settings.


                 - As you read, encourage the “characters” to listen carefully to know what
actions to use, such as Mole catching a whiff of his home, Rat hurrying
ahead, Mole crying, etc. Also, talk about using facial expressions to show
how the characters are feeling. Remind students of the Connections activity


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_
**136**


from earlier. To help them with their acting, tell them to think about how they
would feel if they were Mole or Rat. You may also have students create some
of their own dialogue to go along with the story. Encourage students to use
unit-related vocabulary in their dialogue whenever possible.

Assessment

~~**TEKS 3.5; TEKS 3.6.G; TEKS 3.7.C; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


**SILENT READING ASSESSMENT: “THE BUG HUNT”**
~~**AND “THE SNAKE” (30 MIN.)**~~



30M



**Note:** The Silent Reading Assessment measures students’ ability to read

connected prose and answer simple multiple-choice questions. Each

assessment consists of a story and eight multiple-choice questions. The

questions are meant to be relatively easy. The first story, “The Bug Hunt,” is only

54 words long. It uses only one-syllable words and only a handful of the most

basic spellings, all of which are taught in the Kindergarten curriculum, so this

particular story and set of questions should be very easy for nearly all students.


  - Have students remove Activity Page 6.1.


  - Have students complete Activity Page 6.1 independently and answer the
multiple-choice questions. Tell them that they can look back at the story and
use it to help them answer the questions. This is not a timed assessment.
Allow enough time for students to answer the questions.


  - Tell students that once they complete Activity Page 6.1, they should bring
it to you.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


  - We recommend that you score the “The Bug Hunt” assessment on
Activity Page 6.1 during this class period, as soon as students complete
the assessment.


  - Enter students’ scores on the Placement Planning Chart located at the end
of this lesson.


  - Any students who answered fewer than five comprehension questions
correctly about “The Bug Hunt” should be given the individually administered


**TEKS 3.5** Self-select text and read independently for a sustained period of time; **TEKS 3.6.G** Evaluate details read to

- Since some students will complete the assessment more rapidly than others,
we have included other work that can be completed independently and quietly.
Students can complete Activity Pages 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5 when they finish
either one or both Activity Pages 6.1 and 6.2. You may have them participate
in other independent activities you have planned for them, such as reading
trade books, working at listening centers, or independent writing. Remember,
the important thing is that your classroom be a calm environment that is
conducive for student assessment.


- Enter students’ scores on the Placement Planning Chart located at the end
of this lesson. Note: Students who were able to answer five or more of the
questions correctly on Activity Page 6.2 will take the assessment “Night

- Have students who correctly answered five or more questions return to
their seats and read “The Snake,” found on Activity Page 6.2. Students
should also complete the comprehension questions. “The Snake” is 172
words long and presents a much greater challenge than “The Bug Hunt.” Be
sure to encourage students to take their time and do their best, rereading
the story as necessary.


- Then, score “The Snake,” either while students work independently or
after class.

~~**INTRODUCING THE CHAPTER (10 MIN.)**~~






                 - Make sure each student has a copy of the Reader, _Classic Tales_ .


                  - Read the title of the Reader to students. Take a few moments to talk with
students about the cover and to browse briefly through the images in the
Reader. Have students comment on the images.


                   - Ask students if they recall hearing stories called classic tales in Grades 1 or 2.
Explain to students that the title _Classic Tales_ means that the selections in this
Reader are “classics,” favorite children’s stories for many, many years. All of the
selections in this Reader are fiction, meaning that they are not stories of things
that have actually happened, but rather were created and written from the
imagination of the authors.


                  - Have students turn to the Table of Contents in the Reader.


                 - Either read the Table of Contents aloud to students or have students read
it.


                  - Ask if they recognize the titles of any of these chapters or have any predictions
about this Reader.


                 - Direct students briefly to the world map in the “Introduction: Where in
the World Do These Tales Come From?” and explain that the chapters in
this Reader originate from different places around the world. Two of the
chapters were written by well-known authors, while another story has been
passed down orally in certain countries and cultures.


                   - Ask students to return to the Table of Contents and to point to and read the title
of Chapter 1, “Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, Part I,” reminding students that
the title provides an idea of what the story is about. Note for students that this
story is told in three chapters and that the chapters are numbered I, II, and III.

- Tell students that this story is set in ancient Persia, now known as Iran. Have
students look back at the “Introduction: Where in the World Do These Tales
Come From?” on **page 1** and find Iran on the map by following the arrow from
the title of the story to Iran.




- Tell students that this story comes from a book called _A Thousand and_
_One Nights_, which is a collection of nightly stories a sultan’s wife named
Scheherazade [sh HAIR zod] told her husband.

**143**


**144**



Aladdin took the man to his mother. She was
surprised. Her husband had never spoken of a brother.
Even so, she greeted the man kindly. When he promised
to help Aladdin become a merchant, she believed him.


But the stranger was not Aladdin’s uncle. He was a
magician from faraway north Africa. He had come to
Persia in search of a magic lamp. It was said that this
lamp would make a man rich. To find the lamp, the
magician needed a helper. He was looking for someone
who would help without asking any questions. He
thought Aladdin was just the right person.


The next day, the magician came to get Aladdin.


“Come with me,” he said. “I will introduce you
to other merchants.” Then, he led the boy out into
the country.


_Aladdin took the man to meet his mother._

Lesson 6 Dulce Domum, Part I
**145**


The magician led Aladdin up a steep mountain.
They climbed for an hour. Then, they came to a spot
where no flowers grew.


“Get some sticks,” said the magician. “We will make
a fire. Then, I will show you something amazing.”


Aladdin did as he was told. The magician lit the fire.
Then, he threw perfumes into it and chanted magical
words. The sky darkened. Thunder rumbled. The earth
opened at their feet. There before them was a large
stone with a brass ring attached.


“Under this stone is a treasure,” said the magician.
“It will make you richer than any king. Lift the stone by
the ring. Then, go down the stairs. You will pass many
treasures, but you must not touch them. You will enter
a garden. There you will see a lamp hanging from a
tree. Bring that lamp to me. Once you have it, you may
gather any of the treasures that you see.”


Aladdin was amazed. He could not believe what he
was being asked to do. But he agreed.


“Take this ring,” said the magician. “It will keep
you safe from harm.” Aladdin took it and placed it on
his finger.



_The magician told Aladdin what to do._

Lesson 6 Dulce Domum, Part I
**147**


Aladdin lifted the stone. He went down the stairs.
He made his way through a hallway of treasures. He
was careful not to touch anything. When he found the
lamp, he tucked it inside his bag. Then, he filled his
pockets with all the glittering things he saw. He didn’t
know they were precious gems. He was thinking, “I will
gather these pretty things to play with at home.”


All those gems weighed Aladdin down. When he
came to the top of the staircase, he could not climb out.
“Give me a hand, Uncle,” he cried.


“First, give me the lamp,” the magician answered.


The lamp was buried in the bag Aladdin was carrying.


“I cannot reach it now,” Aladdin said.


“Hand it up to me,” said the magician.


“But I can’t!” Aladdin said.


The magician grew angry. “The lamp!” he cried, for
that was all he cared about.


But Aladdin did not want to drop anything. “I will
give it to you when I get out,” he said.


The impatient magician felt he could wait no longer.
He chanted a magic spell. The stone rolled back, trapping
Aladdin in the black darkness of the cave.



_“Give me the lamp,” said the magician._

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L7.1**
Mole End


It was close and airless, and the earthy

smell was strong. The Mole struck a

match, and by its light the Rat saw

that they were standing in an open

space. The space was neatly swept and sanded underfoot. Directly

facing them was Mole’s little front door, with “Mole End” painted, in

Gothic lettering, over the bell-pull at the side. ~~Gothic lettering is a~~

~~fancy writing style or type font.~~


**TEKS 3.6.C** Make and correct or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structures.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


Mole took down a lantern from a nail on the wall and lit it, and the

Rat, looking round him, saw that they were in a sort of forecourt. A

garden seat stood on one side of the door and on the other a roller.

(The Mole was a tidy animal and could not stand having his ground

kicked up by other animals into little heaps of earth.) Down on one

side of the forecourt ran a skittle alley, with benches along it and little

wooden tables. In the middle was a small round pond.

~~Skittles is a lawn game similar to bowling, and the skittle alley is like a~~

~~bowling alley except outside on a lawn.~~


Mole’s face beamed at the sight of all these objects. He hurried Rat

through the door, lit a lamp in the hall, and took one glance round his

old home. Immediately he saw the dust lying thick on everything, saw

the cheerless, deserted look of the long-neglected house, and collapsed

again on a hall chair. “O Ratty!” he cried **dismally**, “why ever did I do it?

Why did I bring you to this poor, cold little place, on a night like this?”


The Rat paid no heed to him. He was running here and there, opening

doors, inspecting rooms and cupboards, and lighting lamps and

candles. “What a **capital** little house this is!” he called out cheerily.

“Everything here and everything in its place! The first thing we want is

a good fire. I’ll fetch the wood and the coals, and you get a duster!”


**Show Image U1.L7.2**
Deferred housekeeping


Encouraged by his companion, the

Mole dusted and polished with energy,

while the Rat soon had a cheerful

blaze roaring up the chimney. He

hailed the Mole to come and warm himself; but Mole promptly had

you poor, cold, hungry, weary animal? I’ve nothing to give you!”


“What a fellow you are for giving in!” said the Rat calmly. “Why, only

just now I saw a sardine opener on the kitchen dresser; and everybody

knows that means there are sardines about somewhere. Pull yourself

together, and come with me and **forage** .” ~~Forage means to look for or~~

~~search for food.~~


They went and foraged accordingly, hunting through every cupboard

and turning out every drawer. The result was not so very depressing

after all; a tin of sardines—a box of captain’s biscuits, nearly full—and

a German sausage encased in silver paper.


“There’s a banquet for you!” observed the Rat, as he arranged the table.


“No bread!” groaned the Mole; “no butter, no—”


“No caviar!” continued the Rat, grinning. “And that reminds me—

what’s that little door at the end of the passage? Your cellar of

course!” ~~Caviar is an expensive delicacy of special salty fish eggs. Is~~

~~Rat serious or joking when he says there is no caviar?~~


Rat made for the cellar door, and presently reappeared with a bottle

in each paw and another under each arm “Now, wherever did you

pick up those prints? Make the place look so homelike, they do. No

wonder you’re so fond of it, Mole. Tell us all about it, and how you

came to make it what it is.”


The Mole, much cheered by the Rat’s fine compliments took time to

show off his splendid abode. The Rat, though desperately hungry,

allowed the Mole to hold court.


At last the Rat succeeded in decoying him to the table, and had just

got seriously to work with the sardine opener when sounds were

heard from the forecourt without—sounds like the scuffling of small

feet and a confused murmur of tiny voices—


“Now, all in a line—hold the lantern up a bit, Tommy—clear your

throats first—Where’s young Bill?”


“What’s up?” inquired the Rat.


“I think it must be the field mice,” replied the Mole. “They go round

carol-singing regularly at this time of the year. I used to give them hot

drinks and supper, too, sometimes.”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“Let’s have a look at them!” cried the Rat, jumping up and running to

the door.


**Show Image U1.L7.3**
Housework and carolers


It was a pretty sight that met their eyes.

In the forecourt, lit by the dim rays of

a lantern, some eight or ten little field

mice stood in a semicircle. They had

red scarves around their necks, and their forepaws were thrust deep

into their pockets. With bright beady eyes they glanced shyly at each

other. As the door opened, one of the elder ones that carried the lantern

proclaimed, “Now then, one, two, three!” and forthwith their shrill little

voices rose up into the chill night air.


_Villagers all, this frosty tide,_

_Let your doors swing open wide,_

_Though wind may follow, and snow beside,_

_Yet draw us in by your fire to bide;_

_Joy shall be yours in the morning!_


_Here we stand in the cold and the sleet,_

_Blowing fingers and stamping feet,_

_Come from far away you to greet—_

_You by the fire and we in the street—_

_Bidding you joy in the morning!_


_For ere one half of the night was gone,_

_Sudden a star has led us on,_

_Raining bliss and benison—_

_Bliss tomorrow and more anon,_

_Joy for every morning!_


The voices ceased, the singers exchanged sidelong glances—but for

a moment only. Then, from up above and far away, down the tunnel

they had so lately traveled, came the sound of distant bells ringing a


Lesson 7 Dulce Domum, Part II
**159**


**160**



joyful and clangorous peal. ~~A clangorous peal is the loud clanging or~~

~~ringing of bells.~~


“Very well sung, boys!” cried the Rat heartily. “And now come along in

and warm yourselves!”


“Yes, come along, field mice,” cried the Mole eagerly. “This is quite

like old times! Shut the door after you. Pull up that settle to the fire.

Now, you just wait a minute, while we—O, Ratty!” he cried in despair.

“We’ve nothing to give them!”


“You leave all that to me,” said the masterful Rat. “Here, you with the

lantern! I want to talk to you. Now, tell me, are there any shops open

at this hour of the night?”


“Why, certainly, Sir,” replied the field mouse respectfully. “At this time

of the year our shops keep open to all sorts of hours.”


“Then look here!” said the Rat. “You go off at once, you and your

lantern, and you get me—”


Here much muttered conversation ensued, such as—“Fresh, mind!—

no, a pound of that will do—if you can’t get it there, try somewhere

else—yes, of course, homemade!” Finally, there was a chink of coin

passing from paw to paw, the field mouse was provided with a basket

for his purchases, and off he hurried.


The rest of the field mice, perched in a row on the settle, their small

legs swinging, gave themselves up to enjoyment of the fire.


**Show Image U1.L7.4**
A little winter cheer


The Rat, meanwhile, was busy examining

the label on one of the bottles. “I

**perceive** this to be ginger beer,” he

remarked approvingly. “The very thing!

Now we shall be able to mull some ginger beer! Get the things ready, Mole,

while I draw the corks.”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


~~Ginger beer is like root beer.~~


It did not take long to prepare the brew; and soon every field mouse

was sipping and coughing and choking (for a little mulled ginger beer

goes a long way) and wiping his eyes and laughing.


“They act plays, too, these fellows,” the Mole explained to the Rat.

“Make them up all by themselves. And very well they do it, too! They

gave us a capital one last year, about a field mouse who was captured

at sea by pirates. Here, you! You were in it. Get up and recite a bit.”


The field mouse addressed got up on his legs, giggled shyly, looked

round the room, and remained absolutely tongue-tied. His comrades

cheered him on, Mole coaxed and encouraged him, and the Rat went

so far as to shake him; but nothing could overcome his stage fright.

The now-mute field mouse was saved from further encouragement

by the sound of the door opening. The field mouse with the lantern

had reappeared with a heavy basket.


**Show Image U1.L7.5**
Dulce Domum (Home Sweet Home)


There was no more talk of playacting

once the contents of the basket had

been tumbled out onto the table. Under

the generalship of Rat, everybody was

set to do something. In a very few minutes supper was ready. As they

ate, they talked of old times.


They clattered off at last, very grateful indeed. When the door had

closed on the last of them, Mole and Rat kicked the fire up, drew their

chairs in, and discussed the events of the day. At last the Rat, with a

tremendous yawn, said, “Mole, I’m ready to drop. That your own bunk

over on that side? Very well, then, I’ll take this.”


Rat clambered into his bunk and rolled himself well up in the blankets

as **slumber** gathered him in.

~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.6.C; TEKS 3.8.A**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Were your predictions correct about how the themes of

friendship/loyalty, hospitality, responsibility, and irresponsibility play a role

in the second half of the chapter? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


2. **Literal.** At the beginning of the Read-Aloud, Mole looks around dismally

at his empty, dusty home and experiences the blues over the state of his

home. How does Rat help Mole?


» lights a fire, helps Mole clean up, tells Mole he has a capital home, helps Mole

forage for food, etc.


What themes do you think Rat’s actions demonstrate?


» friendship or loyalty—Rat helps Mole feel better, as a friend should; hospitality—

Even in Mole’s home, Rat is taking charge and making things cheerier.


3. **Literal.** While Mole and Rat are foraging for food, who comes to the door?


» field mice


What do they do?


» They sing a carol, or song, for Rat and Mole.


Check for Understanding


**Inferential.** How is the theme of hospitality demonstrated through the
characters’ actions in today’s Read-Aloud?


» Rat and Mole welcome the carolers, or singers, into Mole’s home; Rat

acts hospitably by buying food and drinks for the carolers even though

he is not in his own house; Mole offers Rat a place to sleep; etc.


4. **Inferential.** What words could you use to describe how Mole feels at the

end of the evening?


» happy, content, sleepy


Do you think he is glad that he is back in his own home for the evening? Why?


» Yes, Mole feels comfortable in his home; he is happy to see the field mice; he had

missed his home and is glad to see it.


**TEKS 3.6.C** Make and correct or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structures;
**TEKS 3.8.A** Infer the theme of a work, distinguishing theme from topic.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


How about Rat? Is he comfortable in Mole’s home?


» Yes; at the end of the evening, slumber gathers Rat in, and he sleeps peacefully in

Mole’s home.


5. **Evaluative.** Close your eyes and imagine you are in Mole’s home after he

and Rat have cleaned it up. Describe what you would perceive through your

6. **Inferential.** What kind of friend is Rat?


» helpful, kind, forceful


How do you know?


» Rat helps Mole without complaining or thinking of himself.


7. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ The story today is mostly told from Mole’s

perspective. How do you think the story would be different if it was told

mostly from Rat’s perspective?


» Answers may vary.


~~**WORD WORK: FORAGE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _forage_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity for
students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You may
review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard Rat say to Mole, “[C]ome with me and _forage_ .”


3. Say the word _forage_ with me.


4. Forage means to look around and search for food.


5. Squirrels forage for acorns in the fall and store them away for the winter.


6. Can you name any other animals that forage for food and the types of food
they forage? Be sure to use the word _forage_ when you tell about it. (Ask two
or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses
to make complete sentences: “forage for . . .")


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _forage_ ?


  - Use an Acting activity for follow-up. Tell students to demonstrate to a partner
how they would forage for food in their kitchen or in the woods, and/or how
an animal in nature would forage for food. Make sure the students use the
word _forage_ in a complete sentence throughout this activity.

  - As the student reads a word, mark any incorrect letter-sound
correspondences above the word on the copy of Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment Activity Page 7.4 that students brought to you earlier. (You will use
Activity Pages 7.5–7.7 to analyze scores at a later time.) Also, note whether the
student incorrectly chunks letters into syllables, leading to mispronunciation.
If the student reads the word correctly, simply place a check mark above the
word.


  - If, after 10 seconds, the student is unable to read the word at all, simply tell the
student the word and move on. Mark an X above the word on the recording
sheet.

able to use these words immediately, but with repeated exposure throughout
the lessons they will acquire a good understanding of most of the words.
Students may also keep a “unit dictionary” notebook along with definitions,
sentences, and/or other writing exercises using these vocabulary words.


**conceited,** having a very high opinion of yourself; thinking that you are the best

**gross,** major; extreme

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.6.D**~~


  - Ask students to define _dialogue_ and _narration_ and provide examples from
the story.


  - Remind students that narration helps the reader know what the characters
are doing. Explain that narration also includes a lot of description to help the
reader imagine the plot and setting.


  - Ask students to listen to this excerpt from “Dulce Domum, Part I” to see if
they can identify these elements in the narration:


Not long after their adventures in the Wild Wood, the Rat and the Mole found
themselves plodding silently along a country lane. The rapid nightfall of
mid-December had already descended upon them. The Mole was thinking
of supper as he followed obediently behind the Rat, leaving the guidance in
the darkness entirely to him.


As for the Rat, he was walking a little way ahead, as was his habit. He walked

steadily with his shoulders humped, his eyes fixed on the straight grey
road in front of him. This is why he did not notice poor Mole when suddenly
something soft and subtle, carried gently upon the cool night air, caused
Mole to stop dead in his tracks.


  - Tell students that the voice the author uses to tell the narration part of
the story is called the narrator. Explain that narrators have their own
“personality” that shows through in their style of storytelling, and that may
or may not be the same as the author’s personality.


  - Tell students the title of this Read-Aloud: “Mr. Toad.” Ask students to share
what they remember about Mr. Toad from the prior Read-Alouds.


  - Ask students why Mr. Toad’s friends are concerned about him.


  - Tell students to listen carefully as the narrator tells more about Mr. Toad and
the story themes.


**TEKS 3.6.D** Create mental images to deepen understanding.

discussing the joys of boating. They

were finishing breakfast when a heavy knock sounded at the door.


The Mole went to the door, and the Rat heard him utter a cry of

surprise. Then he flung the door open, and announced, “Mr. Badger!”


The Badger strode into the room, and stood looking at the two

animals with an expression full of seriousness.


“The **hour** has come!” said the Badger at last.


“What hour?” asked the Rat uneasily, glancing at the clock on

the mantelpiece.


“ _Whose_ hour, you should rather say,” replied the Badger. “Why, Toad’s

hour! The hour of Toad! I said I would take him in hand as soon as the

winter was over, and I’m going to take him in hand today!”


“Toad’s hour, of course!” cried the Mole delightedly.


“It has been brought to my attention,” continued the Badger, taking

an armchair, “that another new motorcar will arrive at Toad Hall

today. You two animals will accompany me to Toad Hall, and the work

of rescue shall begin.”


“Right you are!” cried the Rat enthusiastically.


They set off immediately on their mission of mercy.



Challenge


The narrator says that
the animals left for “their
mission of mercy.” Who
might receive mercy from
their plan?



Lesson 8 Mr. Toad

**Show Image U1.L8.2**
Intervention at Toad Hall


They reached Toad Hall to find a shiny

new motorcar parked in the driveway.

As they neared the front door it was

flung open, and Mr. Toad, attired in his

driving clothes, came swaggering down the steps.


“Hullo!” he cried cheerfully. “You’re just in time to come with me for a

jolly—for a—er—jolly—”


Toad’s words faltered as he noticed the stern look on the faces of

his friends.


The Badger strode up the steps. “Take him inside,” he said to his

companions. Then, as Toad was hustled through the door, he turned

to the chauffeur in charge of the new motorcar.


“I’m afraid you won’t be wanted today,” he said. “Mr. Toad has

changed his mind.” With that, the Badger followed the others inside

and shut the door.


“Now then!” he said to the Toad, when the four of them stood

together in the Hall. “Take those ridiculous things off!”


“Shan’t!” replied Toad, with great spirit.


“Take them off him, then, you two,” ordered the Badger.


They had to lay Toad out on the floor before they could get to work

properly. Then the Rat sat on him, and the Mole got his motorclothes

off him bit by bit.


“You knew it must come to this, Toad,” the Badger explained. “You’ve

disregarded all the warnings we’ve given you, you’ve gone on

squandering the money your father left you, and you’re constantly

getting into trouble with the police. You’re getting us animals a bad

name in the area. Now, you will come with me into the library, and

there we will have a serious ‘heart to heart.’”

**Show Image U1.L8.3**
Badger’s heart-to-heart with Toad


He took Toad firmly by the arm, and

led him into the library.


After about three-quarters of an hour

the Badger reappeared, solemnly

leading by the paw a very dejected Toad.


“Sit down there, Toad,” said the Badger kindly, pointing to a chair. “My

friends,” he went on, “I am pleased to inform you that Toad has seen

the error of his ways.”


“That is very good news,” said the Mole gravely.


“Very good news indeed,” observed the Rat dubiously, “if only—”


He was looking very hard at Toad as he said this, and could not help

thinking he perceived something like a twinkle in that animal’s eye.


“There’s only one thing more to be done,” continued the Badger.

“Toad, I want you to repeat, before your friends here, that you see the

error of your ways.”


There was a long, long pause. Toad looked desperately this way and

that. At last he spoke.


“No!” he said, quite firmly; “I admit nothing!”


“What?” cried the Badger. “Didn’t you tell me just now, in there—”


“Oh, yes, yes, in _there_,” said Toad impatiently. “I’d have said anything

in _there_ . You’re so persuasive, dear Badger.”


“Then you don’t promise,” said the Badger, “never to touch a

motorcar again?”


“Certainly not!” replied Toad.


“Told you so!” observed the Rat to the Mole.


Lesson 8 Mr. Toad
**183**


**184**



“Very well, then,” said the Badger firmly. “We’ll have to see what force

can do. You’ve often asked us three to come and stay with you, Toad;

well, now we’re going to. Take him upstairs, you two, and lock him up

in his bedroom.”


**Show Image U1.L8.4**
Taking Toad in hand


“We’ll take great care of everything

till you’re well, Toad,” said the Mole, as

Toad was hauled up the stairs.“


No more of those regrettable incidents

with the police, Toad,” said the Rat, as they thrust him into his

bedroom and locked the door.


They descended the stairs, Toad shouting abuse at them through

the keyhole; and the three friends sat down to discuss the matter.

~~”Shouting abuse” is the British way of saying Toad was angrily yelling~~

~~at the others and calling them names.~~


“Toad must never be left unguarded,” said the Badger, firmly. The

Mole and the Rat nodded in agreement.


They arranged watches accordingly. At first Toad resisted their efforts,

but as time passed, however, he appeared to grow depressed.


One fine morning the Rat, whose turn it was to go on duty, went upstairs

to relieve Badger.


“Toad’s still in bed,” Badger told the Rat. “Now, you look out, Rat! When

Toad’s quiet and submissive, then he’s at his trickiest.” And with that

warning, the Badger departed.


“How are you today?” inquired the Rat cheerfully, as he approached Toad.

**Show Image U1.L8.5**
Toad hatches a plan


A feeble voice replied, “Thank you so

much, dear Ratty! So good of you to

inquire! But first tell me how you are

yourself, and the excellent Mole?”


“O, _we’re_ all right,” replied the Rat. “Mole,” he added innocently, “is

going out for a run with Badger. Now jump up, and don’t lie moping

there on a fine morning like this!”


“Dear, kind Rat,” murmured Toad, “I can’t ‘jump up’ now—if ever! I

hate being a burden, and I do not expect to be one much longer.”


“Well, I hope not, too,” said the Rat heartily.


“I’m a nuisance, I know,” replied the Toad.


“You are, indeed,” said the Rat. “But I tell you, I’d take any trouble on

earth for you, if only you’d be a **sensible** animal.”


“If I thought that, Ratty,” murmured Toad, “then I would beg you to

fetch a doctor.”


“Why, what do you want a doctor for?” inquired the Rat.


“Surely you have noticed of late—” murmured Toad. “But, no—why

should you? Never mind—forget that I asked.”


“Look here,” said the Rat, beginning to get worried, “of course I’ll

fetch a doctor if you really think you need one. But you can hardly be

bad enough for that yet. Let’s talk about something else.”


“I fear, dear friend,” said Toad, “that ‘talk’ can do little for me. And, by

the way—if you do fetch a doctor—would you mind fetching a lawyer,

too?” ~~Do you think Toad really needs a doctor and a lawyer? Why is he~~

~~asking for them?~~


“A lawyer! O, gracious me!” the concerned Rat said to himself, as he hurried

from the room, not forgetting, however, to lock the door behind him.


Lesson 8 Mr. Toad
**185**


**186**



Outside, he stopped only for a moment to consider Toad’s behavior,

before running off to the village on his errand of mercy.


**Show Image U1.L8.6**
Toad’s escape


As the key turned in the lock, the Toad

hopped out of bed. Toad watched Rat

from his window until he was out of

sight. Laughing heartily, Toad dressed

quickly in his best suit, filled his pockets with cash, and **improvised**

a rope by knotting sheets from his bed together. Tying one end of the

rope around the strongest part of his window, Toad slid lightly to the

ground and, taking the opposite direction to the Rat, marched off

lightheartedly, whistling a merry tune.


It was a gloomy luncheon for Rat when the Badger and the Mole returned.


“He did it awfully well,” said the crestfallen Rat.


“He did _you_ awfully well!” replied the Badger hotly. “He’s got clear

away—for now. And the worst of it is, he’ll be so **conceited** with what

he’ll think is his cleverness that he may commit any folly. But we’d better

stay here. Toad may be brought back at any moment—on a stretcher, or

between two policemen.”


Meanwhile, Toad was walking briskly along a main road.


“Smart piece of work that!” he remarked to himself.


With this thought in mind, he strode along till he reached a little town,

where the sign of “The Red Lion” reminded him that he was hungry.

He marched into the inn and ordered lunch.


He was about halfway through his meal when a familiar sound made

him jump. The glorious sound of a motorcar could be heard in the

innyard. Before long, the owners of the motorcar appeared in the inn.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


Eager to get a look at the vehicle, the Toad slipped out and sauntered

round to the innyard. “There cannot be any harm,” he said to himself,

“in my just _looking_ at it!”


The car stood in the middle of the yard. Toad walked slowly round it.


“I wonder if this sort of car _starts_ easily?” he said to himself.


Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he was hurtling

along in someone else’s motorcar.


**Show Image U1.L8.7**
Crime and punishment


“To my mind,” observed the Chairman

of the Bench of Magistrates, “the _only_

difficulty that presents itself is how we

can sufficiently punish this rogue. He

has been found guilty of stealing a motorcar; of driving dangerously;

and of **gross impertinence** to the rural police. Mr. Clerk, will you tell

us what is the stiffest penalty we can impose on this villain?” ~~_Gross_~~

~~means extreme, and~~ ~~_impertinence_~~ ~~means disrespect.~~


The Clerk scratched his nose. “Supposing you were to say twelve

months for the theft; and three years for the furious driving; and fifteen

years for the cheek. Those figures, if added together correctly, total up

to nineteen years—”


~~_Cheek_~~ ~~is a British word used to mean rude boldness.~~


“First-rate!” said the Chairman.


“—So you had better make it a round twenty years,” concluded the Clerk.


“An excellent suggestion!” said the Chairman. “Prisoner! It’s going to

be twenty years for you this time!”

~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** What are some themes the narrator communicates in

this chapter?


» friendship/loyalty, responsibility, irresponsibility


What are some examples?


» Toad’s friends are loyal and responsible by doing what they know is good for

him; Toad is irresponsible in spending his father’s money, getting in trouble with

the police, giving his friends a bad name, escaping his friends and ending up in

prison; etc.


2. **Inferential.** Describe “the hour” in this chapter that comes for Toad.


» Mr. Badger, Rat, and Mole decide it is time to make him a sensible Toad; they want

to teach him responsibility and keep him from hurting himself and those around

him any longer.


3. **Inferential.** What reasons do Mr. Badger, Rat, and Mole have to make Toad

be more responsible?


» Toad is a careless driver who is involved in several car accidents and even ends up

in the hospital a few times. They want him to be more sensible about cars because

it is causing him and other animals danger, as well as giving them bad reputations.


4. **Literal.** What do Mr. Badger, Rat, and Mole do in their attempts to make

Toad more responsible?


» They decide to go to his house and lock him up in his bedroom so he won’t be able

to drive. They take turns making sure he is never unguarded. They do not trust

him to be alone.


5. **Inferential.** Is their plan successful?


» no


Why not?


» Toad tricks Rat into thinking he is sick. Rat leaves Toad unattended to search for

a doctor and lawyer. Toad improvises a rope with his sheets, and is able to escape

from his bedroom window.


How do Mr. Badger and Mole react to the news of Toad’s escape?


» They are upset that Rat trusts Toad enough to leave him unattended.


6. **Literal.** What happens to Toad at the end?


» He is found guilty of stealing a car, and gross impertinence to the police, and is

sent to prison for 20 years.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


7. **Inferential.** From which character’s perspective is the end of this Read
Aloud?


» Toad’s


How do you know?


» The reader knows Toad’s conceited thoughts and plans of stealing the motorcar,

sees Toad’s actions through his eyes, etc.


Check for Understanding


**Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Do you think Toad’s punishment of being
sent to jail for 20 years is fair? Why or why not? Do you think this sentence
will change Toad’s behavior?


» Answers may vary.


After hearing today’s Read-Aloud and comprehension questions and
answers, do you have any remaining questions?


~~**WORD WORK: CONCEITED (5 MIN.)**~~


8. Write the word _conceited_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You
may review syllable division patterns at this time.


9. Today you heard that after Toad fools Rat, he is full of _conceited_ thoughts.


10. Say the word _conceited_ with me.


11. When you are conceited, you have a very high opinion of yourself. When you
have conceited thoughts, you are thinking about how great you are.


12. Tony is very conceited; he thinks his drawing is far better than anyone else’s.


13. Have you ever seen someone act conceited? How did they act? Be sure to
use the word _conceited_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students.
If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete
sentences: “I saw someone act conceited when . . .”]


14. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _conceited_ ?


  - Use an Acting activity for follow-up. Have students demonstrate conceited
behavior. You may also wish to have students act conceited like Toad,
creating dialogue from his perspective. Make sure that students use the word
_conceited_ in complete sentences throughout this activity.

Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will demonstrate an understanding of the saying “One

rotten apple spoils the whole barrel” and will describe the author’s purpose in

using figurative language. ~~**[ TEKS 3.3.D ]**~~


~~**SAYINGS AND PHRASES (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that proverbs are short, traditional sayings that have been
passed along orally from generation to generation. These sayings usually
express general truths based on experiences and observations of everyday life.
Although some proverbs do have literal meanings—that is, they mean exactly
what they say—many proverbs have a richer meaning beyond the literal level.
Note: It is important to help students understand the difference between the
literal meanings of the words and the implied or figurative meanings.


  - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone say, “One rotten apple spoils the
whole barrel.”


  - Have students repeat the proverb. Ask students to guess what this phrase means.


  - Explain that, literally or specifically, this phrase means that an apple or another
piece of fruit that has gone bad will eventually make all of the surrounding fruit
spoil if it remains in the same barrel or container.


  - Ask students to guess what a “rotten apple” symbolizes, or stands for.


  - Explain that the saying means that one badly behaving person or one bad
thing can spoil anything that is close to it.


  - Tell students that this saying is a metaphor.


  - Explain that a metaphor is a word or phrase that stands for something else. A
metaphor is a way to say something figuratively or symbolically. So the phrase


**TEKS 3.3.D** Identify use, and explain the meaning of antonyms, synonyms, idioms, homophones, and homographs in a text.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“One rotten apple spoils the whole barrel” has a literal (or specific) meaning
and a figurative (or symbolic) meaning.


  - Reread this passage:


“You knew it must come to this, Toad,” the Badger explained. You’ve
disregarded all the warnings we’ve given you, you’ve gone on squandering the
money your father left you, and you’re constantly getting into trouble with the
police. You’re getting us animals a bad name in the area. Now, you will come
with me into the library, and there we will have a serious ‘heart to heart.’”


  - Instead of saying, “You’re getting us animals a bad name,” Badger could have
said to Toad, “One rotten apple spoils the whole barrel.”


  - Ask the following questions:


    - Who figuratively is the “rotten apple”? _(Toad)_


    - Who figuratively is the “barrel” (or other apples)? _(close animal friends of_
_Toad, i.e., Badger, Rat, and Mole)_


    - Who says in his own words that Toad figuratively is the “rotten apple”? _(Badger)_


    - What is the literal or specific meaning of the phrase “One rotten apple

spoils the whole barrel”? _(One rotten apple can make the rest of the apples_
_in a barrel go bad, too.)_


    - Why do you think the author used this metaphor?


  - Tell students that Toad’s actions are affecting how others connected to him
are perceived. Because Toad is acting irresponsibly, others along the River
Bank and in the Wild Wood are beginning to think that Toad’s friends are also
irresponsible.


  - On a blank piece of paper, have students draw a situation that is an example
where “one rotten apple” has spoiled the “whole barrel.” Encourage students
to add a few sentences to describe their illustration.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**[ TEKS 3.3.D ]**~~

**Chapter** **[Aladdin and the ]**

**Wonderful Lamp,**
**Part II**
###### **2**

Aladdin was trapped in the cave.


“Uncle!” he called. “Help me!” But there was no
reply. The magician had whisked himself back to north
Africa. All he wanted was the lamp. If Aladdin would
not help him get that, he cared nothing for Aladdin.


For three days, Aladdin stayed in the pitch-black
cave. At first, he shouted. Then, he wept. Finally, he put
his hands together to pray. As he did so, he happened to
rub the ring that the magician had placed on his finger.
A genie rose before him.


“What is your wish?” said the genie of the ring.


Aladdin was scared but he managed to say, “Take me
out of this cave!”


Poof!


Aladdin found himself outside again.

Lesson 8 Mr. Toad
**197**


One day at the market, Aladdin caught a glimpse of
the Sultan’s daughter. She was so beautiful that he fell
in love at once. He told his mother that he wanted to
marry the princess.


Aladdin’s mother laughed. “Have you lost your
senses?” she said. “Your father was a poor tailor!”


“Remember the glittering things from the cave?”
said Aladdin. “Take them and offer them as a gift to
the Sultan.”


Aladdin’s mother went to the Sultan. “My lord,” she
said. “My son Aladdin wishes to marry your daughter.”


The Sultan burst out laughing. “Your son and my
daughter?” he boomed. “Ha!”


Aladdin’s mother opened her cloth and displayed
the gems.


The Sultan fell silent. He stepped forward to look
closely at what he saw. He realized that they were not
just pretty, glittering things.


“These are astounding!” the Sultan thought. “I have
never seen such radiant gems!”


The Sultan spoke again: “Your son may marry
my daughter—on one condition. He must send forty
servants, each carrying a bowl of gems like these.”

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Review with students what they learned in the previous lesson about
the terms _narrator_ and _point of view_ . You may wish to ask the following
questions:


   - What is a narrator? _(the voice the author uses to tell the story)_


   - What is point of view? _(the way the author chooses to have the narrator tell_
_the story)_


   - Which point of view does the author of _The Wind in the Willows_ have the
narrator use? _(third-person point of view)_


   - What are some key words used for third-person point of view? _(he, she, it,_
_his, her, its, characters’ names, etc.)_


 - Ask students what themes they have heard thus far in _The Wind in the_
_Willows_ . _(friendship/loyalty, hospitality, responsibility, and irresponsibility)_ Tell
students that today they will hear more about the theme of irresponsibility.
Ask students the following questions:


   - Would you consider Toad to be responsible or irresponsible based on his
actions so far? _(irresponsible)_


   - What examples from the previous Read-Alouds demonstrate Toad’s
irresponsibility? _(He didn’t care about mending his wrecked caravan;_
_he thinks nothing of getting into car accidents; he doesn’t take care of_
_himself; he steals a car; he doesn’t think about the consequences of his_
_actions; he is a “rotten apple” that affects his friends’ reputations; etc.)_


   - Which characters have a sense of responsibility in the previous ReadAloud? _(Mr. Badger, Rat, and Mole)_


   - What examples from the previous Read-Alouds demonstrate responsibility?
_(Rat and Mole make arrangements to have the caravan fixed; Mr. Badger,_
_Rat, and Mole try to help their friend Toad by making sure he does not get_
_into any more trouble.)_


 - Ask students, “Now that Toad has been sent to prison, what do you think
will happen? Do you think being locked up will teach Toad to mend his
irresponsible ways? Do you think Mr. Toad will serve his 20-year sentence?”


 - Tell students to listen carefully for the key words that signify the third-person
point of view and to hear if their predictions are correct.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L9.1**
Mr. Toad behind bars


When Toad found himself in a dark

**dungeon**, he flung himself on the

floor and cried. “This is the end of

everything,” he said. “Imagine, Toad

imprisoned for stealing a motorcar, and for lurid cheek. Ridiculous

animal that I was,” he reproached himself. With lamentations such as

these he passed his days, refusing his meals.


Now the gaoler [JAIL-er] had a daughter who assisted her father. The

gaoler’s daughter was **particularly** fond of animals. This kindhearted

girl said to her father one day, “Father! If you let me look after the

Toad, I’ll make sure he eats.”


Her father replied that she could do what she liked with him. He was

tired of Toad. So that day she knocked at the door of Toad’s cell.


“Now, cheer up, Toad,” she said, “and dry your eyes. Please do eat

some dinner. See, I’ve brought you some of mine.”


It was bubble-and-squeak, and its fragrance reached the nose of

Toad, but he stubbornly refused to eat. Instead Toad wailed and

would not be comforted. So the wise girl retired for the time. ~~Bubble-~~

~~and-squeak is a traditional English dish made of leftover vegetables~~

~~in which the main ingredients are potato and cabbage. It is often~~

~~eaten with a meat roast, and its name comes from the sound the food~~

~~makes as it cooks.~~



Challenge


Ask students what kinds
of words represent the
sounds they make.



Lesson 9 Toad’s Adventures

**Show Image U1.L9.2**
A little tea for Toad


When the girl returned, some hours

later, she carried a tray with a cup

of fragrant tea steaming on it; and a

plate piled up with hot buttered toast.

Toad sat up, dried his eyes, sipped his tea, and munched his toast.

Before long he began talking freely.


The gaoler’s daughter saw that this social interaction was doing Toad

as much good as the tea.


“Tell me about Toad Hall,” said the girl.


“Toad Hall,” said the Toad proudly, “is a gentleman’s residence dating

from the fourteenth century. It is five minutes from church, the post

office, and the golf course. Suitable for—”


“Gracious,” said the girl, laughing,“I don’t want to _buy_ it. Tell me something

_real_ about it. But first wait till I fetch you some more tea and toast.”


She skipped away, and presently returned with a fresh trayful; and Toad,

munching on another piece of buttered toast, told her all about Toad Hall.


They had many interesting talks together, after that, and the gaoler’s

daughter grew very fond of Toad.


One morning the girl spoke to Toad in an exceptionally thoughtful manner.


“Toad,” she said, “I need you to listen carefully. I have an aunt who

is a washerwoman.” ~~What do you think a washerwoman does? (A~~

~~washerwoman’s job is to wash laundry.)~~


“There, there,” said Toad kindly, “never mind; I have several aunts who

_ought_ to be washerwomen.”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“Do be quiet, Toad,” said the girl. “As I said, I have an aunt who is a

washerwoman; she does the washing for all the prisoners. If you were

to offer her some money, I believe she would let you have her dress

and bonnet, and you could escape in **disguise** . You’re very alike in

many respects—particularly about the figure.” ~~In other words, the~~

~~gaoler’s daughter thinks Toad looks like her washerwoman aunt.~~


“We’re _not_,” said the Toad in a huff.


“Toad, I am trying to help you!” exclaimed the girl.


“Yes, yes, I see; thank you very much,” said the Toad hurriedly.

“But you wouldn’t surely have Mr. Toad going about disguised as a

washerwoman!”


“I suppose you want to escape in a horse-drawn carriage!” the

girl retorted.


Toad began to see the error of his ways. “You are a kind girl,” he

said. “Please introduce me to your aunt. I am sure we can come to a

mutually agreeable arrangement.”


Next evening the girl ushered her aunt into Toad’s cell. The sight of

certain gold coins sealed the deal. In return for cash, Toad received

a cotton print dress, an apron, a shawl, and a black bonnet. The only

stipulation the old lady made was that she should be gagged and

bound and placed in a corner of Toad’s cell. This way, she hoped to

escape suspicion that she had helped Toad escape by making it look

like she had been attacked.


Toad was more than willing to oblige. And when the time came, he

tied her up with great gusto!


“Now it’s your turn, Toad,” said the girl. “Take off that coat and

waistcoat of yours.”



Support


A waistcoat is a
dressy vest.



Lesson 9 Toad’s Adventures
**211**


Explain


A disguise allows
someone to change what
they look like or act like. A

disguise does not change
who you are, but it makes

it difficult for people to

recognize you.


**212**



**Show Image U1.L9.3**
Disguise


Shaking with laughter, she helped him

into the dress.


“You’re the very image of her,” she

giggled. “Now, good luck, Toad!”


With a quaking heart, Toad set forth cautiously. He was soon surprised

to find that the washerwoman’s squat figure, in its familiar cotton

dress, opened every barred door, including the one that opened

onto the outside world. ~~In other words, Toad’s disguise works, and~~

~~everyone allows the “washerwoman” through.~~


Toad immediately walked towards the nearest town. As he walked

along, he spotted some red and green lights a little way off, and the

sound of the puffing of engines. “Aha!” he thought, “a railway station.”


He made his way to the station and found that a train, bound more or

less in the direction of his home, was due to leave. “More luck!” said

Toad, as he went off to buy his ticket.


He gave the name of the station that he knew to be nearest to Toad

Hall, and mechanically reached into his waistcoat pocket for his

money. But here the cotton gown thwarted his efforts. As a line began

to form behind him, the Toad slowly began to realize that not only was

there no waistcoat in the gown, but there was no money either.


Forgetting his disguise, the Toad commanded the attention of the

clerk: “I am Toad of Toad Hall. I’ve left my money behind,” he offered.

“Give me a ticket, and I’ll send the money on tomorrow.”


The clerk ignored Toad’s request. “Stand away from the window,

please, madam!” the clerk ordered.


Full of despair, he wandered blindly down the platform. What was

to be done? As he pondered, he found himself opposite the engine,

which was being tended to by its driver.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“Hullo, madam!” said the engine driver, “what’s the trouble?”


“O, sir!” said Toad, crying afresh, “I am a poor washerwoman, and I’ve

lost my money, and can’t pay for a ticket.”


“That’s a bad business, indeed,” said the engine driver.“Lost your money—

and can’t get home—and got some kids, too, waiting for you, I dare say?”


“Any amount of ’em,” sobbed Toad. “And they’ll be hungry—and playing

with matches.” ~~Why do you think Toad says this?~~


“Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” said the engine driver. “If you’ll wash

some shirts for me when you get home, and send ’em along, I’ll give

you a ride on my engine.”


Toad agreed and scrambled up into the cab of the engine. Of course,

he had never washed a shirt in his life.


The guard waved his flag, the engine driver whistled, and the train

moved out of the station.


**Show Image U1.L9.4**
Mr. Toad’s great escape


They had covered many a mile, when

Toad noticed that the engine driver

was leaning over the side of the

engine. Then he saw him climb onto

the coals and gaze out over the top of the train; then he returned and

said to Toad: “It’s very strange; we’re the last train running in this

direction tonight, yet I’m sure that I heard another following us!”


Toad became alarmed.


By this time the moon was shining brightly, and the engine driver,

steadying himself on the coal, could see more clearly the line behind them.


Presently he called out, “I can see it now! It is an engine coming along

at a great pace! It looks as if we are being **pursued** !”


The miserable Toad crouched in the coal-dust.


Lesson 9 Toad’s Adventures
**213**


**214**



“The engine is crowded with policemen and the strangest lot of

people all shouting the same thing—‘Stop!’” cried the engine driver.


At that moment, Toad fell on his knees and cried, “Save me, dear

Mr. Engine Driver! I am not a washerwoman! I am the well-known

Mr. Toad. I have just escaped from prison!”


The engine driver looked down upon him very sternly, and said, “Now

tell the truth; what were you put in prison for?”


“It was nothing very much,” said poor Toad. “I only borrowed a motorcar.”


The engine driver looked very grave and said, “I fear that you have been

a wicked toad. But you are evidently in **distress** so I will not desert you.”


They piled on more coals; the engine leapt but still their pursuers

gained. The engine driver wiped his brow and said, “It’s no good,

Toad. They have the better engine. There’s just one thing left. A short

way ahead of us is a long tunnel, and on the other side of that the line

passes through a thick wood. I will put on all the speed I can while we

are running through the tunnel. When we are through, I will put on the

brakes. The moment it’s safe to do so, you must jump and hide in the

wood. Then I will go full speed ahead again.”


**Show Image U1.L9.5**
Mr. Toad jumps from the train


They piled on more coals, and the

train shot into the tunnel and out at

the other end. The wood lay dark and

brooding upon either side of the line.

The driver shut off the steam and put on the brakes. The Toad got

down on the step, and as the train slowed he heard the driver call

out, “Now, jump!”


Toad jumped, rolled down an embankment, and scrambled into the

wood and hid.


Peeping out, he saw his train get up speed again. Then out of the

tunnel burst the pursuing engine.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


It didn’t take long for the Toad to realize that it was now very late and

dark, and he was in an unknown wood. After so many weeks within

walls, he found the wood strange and unfriendly. Toad walked until he

could walk no further. At last, cold and tired, he sought the shelter of

a hollow tree where he slept till the morning.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


**Evaluative.** Were your predictions correct about whether Toad mends his
irresponsible ways, or serves his 20-year sentence? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


1. **Inferential.** When Toad is in the dungeon, what is his state of mind? In other

words, how does he act that tells you about what he is thinking?


» Toad is in distress, cries, and won’t eat. He admits that he was stupid for stealing

the motorcar, and for his impertinence to the police and the magistrate.


2. **Literal.** How does Toad manage to escape the dungeon?


» The gaoler’s daughter feels particularly sorry for Toad and helps him find a

disguise as a washerwoman in order to escape.


3. **Literal.** What is the first thing Toad does once he escapes?


» He goes to a railway station.


What happens at the station?


» He wants to buy a ticket, but he realizes he has left all his money back at the

dungeon where he had to leave his own clothes. He tells the ticket clerk that he

is Toad of Toad Hall, but the clerk doesn’t believe him, because Toad looks like a

washerwoman. He tells Toad to move away from the ticket window.


4. **Literal.** How is Toad able to get on the train?


» Toad finds the engine driver and tells him a story about how he’s lost his money and

can’t pay for a ticket. He says that he is worried his children are at home playing

with matches. The engine driver feels sorry for washerwoman Toad, and lets him get

on the train as long as he promises to wash some shirts once he returns home.


Lesson 9 Toad’s Adventures
**215**


**216**



5. **Literal.** Another train pursues the train Toad is on. Who is on that train?


» policemen from the jail yelling at the train to stop


6. **Literal.** How does Toad manage to escape the policemen this time?


» Toad confesses who he is to the engine driver. The engine driver asks Toad about

his crime, and Toad tells him the crime was “borrowing” a motorcar. The engine

driver agrees to help Toad in his time of distress. They try to outrun the other train,

but after discovering the train he is on cannot outrun the other train, Toad jumps

off and runs into the woods.


7. **Inferential.** What theme is portrayed in today’s Read-Aloud?


» irresponsibility


How is Toad irresponsible?


» Instead of staying in the jail and accepting the punishment for what he did, Toad

disguises himself, lies, and escapes his responsibility.


8. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ If you were the gaoler’s daughter, would you

have helped irresponsible Toad escape from the dungeon? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


~~**WORD WORK: PURSUED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _pursued_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity

for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You
may review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the story today, you heard that Toad was on a train being _pursued_ by
policemen on another train.


3. Say the word _pursued_ with me.


4. _Pursued_ means being chased after or followed in an attempt to be captured
by someone or something.


5. The squirrel was being pursued by the barking dog.


6. Have you ever been pursued by anyone? Have you ever seen a person or an
animal being pursued? Have you ever pursued anyone? Be sure to use the
word _pursued_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences:
“I was pursued by . . .”)


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _pursued_ ?


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


- Use a Brainstorming activity for follow-up. Have students brainstorm situations
where someone might be pursued. You may also wish to explain to students how
this word may be used in a figurative sense, such as pursuing a goal or dream.
Encourage students to share any goals they have pursued. As students share,
make sure they use the word _pursued_ in a complete sentence.

» _gaoler_ ’ _s daughter_, _girl_, _she_, _her_


    - Have students underline third-person words that relate to the gaoler’s

daughter in the passage.


    - Tell students that together they are going to change this passage

from third-person point of view to first-person point of view from the
perspective of the gaoler’s daughter.


    - Ask students what key first-person words they think will replace the words

_girl, gaoler’s daughter, she_, and _her_ . ( _I, me, my_ ) Model for students how to
convert these sentences to first-person point of view:


I am the gaoler’s daughter, and I help my father out at work. I am particularly
fond of animals. I am kindhearted, and one day I said to my father . . .


    - Point out that the key words in the daughter’s dialogue do not change,
because even when the narration is written in the third-person point of
view, the dialogue is written in the first-person point of view.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students what themes they have heard so far in _The Wind in the Willows_ .
_(friendship/loyalty, hospitality, responsibility, and irresponsibility)_

 - Remind students that they have heard many examples of these themes
throughout the chapters of this book.

 - Remind students that in the previous lesson they learned more about the
theme of irresponsibility. Ask students what word is an antonym, or opposite,
of the word _irresponsibility_ .

 - Ask students if they think Toad is responsible or irresponsible. You may also
wish to encourage students to use the saying “One rotten apple spoils the
whole barrel” in reference to Toad and his irresponsible ways.

 - Ask students, “Where were we in the story at the end of the last ReadAloud?”

 - Ask students if they remember what a disguise is from the previous ReadAloud.

 - Ask students if they can think of any situations where a disguise would be
helpful or harmful. Have students give examples of characters in stories
they’ve heard who have worn disguises to trick others in order to
accomplish something.

 - Ask students what they think of Toad’s disguise, and ask if they think it is
helpful or harmful to Toad and to others.

 - Remind students that Toad has fooled many people disguised as
a washerwoman.

 - Ask, “Do think he will continue to fool people? Do you think he will gain a
sense of responsibility, or will he continue to be irresponsible?”


 - Tell students to listen carefully to find out if their predictions are correct.



Explain


Toad is dressed in female
type clothing in a lot of
the images. This is his
disguise. A disguise allows
someone to change what
they look like or act like. A
disguise does not change
who you are, but it makes
it difficult for people to
recognize you.



Lesson 10 The Further Adventures of Toad, Part I

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L10.1**
Toad in the woods, still in disguise


The front door of the hollow tree

faced eastward, so Toad was woken

up at an early hour. The bright

sunlight was streaming in on him, and

his toes were exceedingly cold. Just before he woke up, he had been

dreaming that he was at home in bed on a cold winter’s night. He

would probably have been awoken much earlier, had he not slept for

some weeks on straw strewn on a stone floor.


Sitting up, he rubbed his eyes first and his complaining toes next, wondered

for a moment where he was; then, with a leap of the heart, remembered

everything—his escape, his flight, his pursuit, and that he was free!


_Free!_ The word and the thought alone were worth fifty blankets. He

shook himself and combed the dry leaves out of his hair with his

fingers. Then he marched forth into the comfortable morning sun—

cold but confident, hungry but hopeful.


He had the world all to himself, that early summer morning: the dewy

woodland, the green fields, the road itself. Toad, however, was looking for

something that could talk and tell him clearly which way he ought to go.


**Show Image U1.L10.2**
The canal and the barge-woman


The country road was presently joined

by a canal. Toad, having traveled

fairly extensively knew that both the

road and the canal were coming _from_

somewhere, and going to somewhere.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“That’s a fact, Toad, my boy!” he proclaimed confidently as he

marched along by the water’s edge.


Round a bend in the canal came plodding a **solitary** horse. From a

rope attached to his collar stretched a long, taut line. Toad let the

horse pass him. With a pleasant swirl of quiet water a barge slid up

alongside of him. The barge’s brightly painted gunwale [GUN-uhl]

was level with the towing path, and its sole **occupant** was a large

woman wearing a sunbonnet. ~~The gunwale is the top edge around the~~

~~deck of a boat.~~


“A nice morning, ma’am!” she remarked to Toad, as she drew up level

with him.


“I dare say it is, ma’am!” responded Toad politely, as he walked along

the towpath abreast of her. “I dare say it _is_ a nice morning to them

that’s not in trouble, like what I am. Here’s my married daughter, she

asks me to come to her at once; so off I comes, not knowing what

may be happening, but fearing the worst. And I’ve left my business

to look after itself—I’m in the laundering line—and I’ve left my young

children, too. I’ve lost all my money, and lost my way, and as for what

may be happening to my married daughter, why, I don’t like to think

of it, ma’am!”


“Where might your married daughter be living, ma’am?” asked the

barge-woman.


“She lives near to the river, ma’am,” replied Toad. “Close to a fine

house called Toad Hall. Perhaps you may have heard of it.”


“Toad Hall? Why, I’m going that way myself,” replied the barge-woman.

“This canal joins the river some miles further on, a little above Toad

Hall; and then it’s an easy walk. I’ll give you a lift.”


She steered the barge close to the bank, and Toad stepped lightly

on board and sat down with great satisfaction. “Toad’s luck again!”

Toad and the barge-woman


“So you’re in the laundering business,

ma’am?” said the barge-woman politely.

“And a very good business you’ve got, too.”


“Finest business in the whole country,”

said Toad airily. “All the gentry come to me—wouldn’t go to anyone

else. You see, I understand my work thoroughly, and attend to it all

myself. Washing, ironing, clear-starching, making up gents’ fine shirts

for evening wear—everything’s done under my own eye!”


“But surely you don’t do _all_ that work yourself, ma’am?” asked the

barge-woman respectfully.


“O, I have girls,” said Toad lightly; “twenty girls or thereabouts.”


“So do I, too,” said the barge-woman with great heartiness. “It seems

you are very fond of washing.”


“I love it,” said Toad. “Never so happy as when I’ve got both arms in

the wash-tub!”


“What a bit of luck, meeting you!” observed the barge-woman. “Why,

what do you mean?” asked Toad, nervously. “Well,” replied the barge
woman. “I like washing, too, but my husband, he’s such a fellow for

shirking his work and leaving the barge to me. I simply do not have a

moment to see to my own affairs. By rights he ought to be here now.

Instead of which, he’s gone off with the dog, to see if they can’t pick

up a rabbit for dinner. Says he’ll catch me up at the next lock. But

meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?”


“O, never mind about the washing,” said Toad, not liking the subject.

“Try and fix your mind on that rabbit. Got any onions?”


“I can’t fix my mind on anything but my washing,” said the barge
woman, “and I wonder you can be talking of rabbits, with such a

joyful prospect before you. There’s a heap of things of mine that need

washing. If you’ll just take one or two of the most necessary sort—I


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


won’t venture to describe them to a lady like you—and put them

through the wash-tub, why, it’ll entertain you, and help me. You’ll find

a tub handy, and soap, and a kettle on the stove.”


“Here, you let me steer!” said Toad, now thoroughly frightened,

“and then you can get on with your own washing. I’m more used to

gentlemen’s things myself.”


“Let you steer?” replied the barge-woman, laughing. “It takes some

practice to steer a barge properly. No, you shall do the washing, and

I’ll stick to the steering. Don’t try and **deprive** me of the joy of giving

you a treat!”


Toad was fairly cornered. He saw that there was no means of escape

and resigned himself to his **fate** . “If it comes to that,” he thought in

desperation, “I suppose any fool can wash!”


**Show Image U1.L10.4**
The barge-woman drives a hard bargain
with reluctant Toad


Toad fetched a tub, soap, and other

necessaries from the cabin, selected a

few garments at random, and set to.


A long half-hour passed, and every minute of it saw Toad getting

crosser and crosser. Nothing that he could do would remove the

stubborn grime. Once or twice he looked nervously over his shoulder

at the barge-woman, but she appeared to be gazing out in front of

her. His back ached badly, and he noticed with dismay that his hands

were beginning to get all crinkly.


A burst of laughter made him straighten himself and look round.

The barge-woman was leaning back and laughing **unrestrainedly.**


“I’ve been watching you,” she gasped. “I thought you must be a

humbug all along. Never washed so much as a dishcloth in your life,

I’ll bet!” ~~_Humbug_~~ ~~here means a person who is faking.~~

Challenge


Ask students what it
means to relinquish the
tiller. _(to let go of the_
_rudder, the device used for_
_steering the boat)_


**242**



Toad’s temper, which had been simmering for some time, now fairly

boiled over, and he lost all control of himself.


“You silly barge-woman!” he shouted. “Don’t you dare to talk to me

like that! I would have you know that I am a very respected Toad! I

may be under a bit of a cloud at present, but I will _not_ be laughed at

by a barge-woman!”


The woman moved nearer to him and peered under his bonnet. “Why,

so you are!” she cried. “A horrid, nasty, crawly Toad! And in my nice

clean barge, too! Now that is a thing that I will _not_ have.”


**Show Image U1.L10.5**
The barge-woman calls Toad’s bluff


She relinquished the tiller for a

moment. One big mottled arm shot out

and caught Toad by a foreleg, while the

other gripped him fast by a hind leg.

Then the world turned upside down, and Toad found himself flying

through the air.


The water, when he eventually reached it, proved quite cold. He rose

to the surface, spluttering. When he had wiped the duckweed out of

his eyes, the first thing he saw was the barge-woman looking back at

him and laughing. Toad vowed **revenge** . He struck out for the shore

and climbed up the steep bank. Gathering up his wet skirts, he ran

after the barge as fast as his toad legs would carry him.


The barge-woman was still laughing when he drew up level with her.

“Put yourself through your mangle, washerwoman,” she called out,

“and iron your face, and you’ll pass for quite a decent-looking Toad!”

Toad steals the barge-woman’s horse


Toad never paused to reply. Solid

revenge was what he wanted, and

he saw it just ahead of him. Running

swiftly on, he overtook the solitary

horse, unfastened the towrope, jumped on the horse’s back, and

urged it to gallop forward. He steered the horse toward the open

country, abandoning the towpath. He looked back and saw that the

barge had run aground on the other side of the canal. Toad laughed

aloud as he continued to spur the horse onward.


The barge horse was not capable of galloping about the countryside,

and its gallop soon subsided into an easy walk; but Toad was quite

contented with this, knowing that the barge was not moving at all.

~~Why do you think Toad is feeling contented?~~


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Were your predictions correct about whether Toad will continue

to fool people, or gain a sense of responsibility? Why or why not?

What happens to uncover his disguise?


» He has never washed clothes before, and the barge-woman thinks it is funny that

a washerwoman is having so much trouble washing her clothes. Toad grows upset

that a mere barge-woman would dare laugh so unrestrainedly at Mr. Toad of Toad

Hall, so he reveals his identity to her and insults her. She throws him off the barge.

5. If you deprive some plants of necessary sunlight, they will die.


6. Has anyone ever done something to deprive you of something? Be sure to
use the word _deprive_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete
sentences: “I was once deprived of . . .”)


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _deprive_ ?

name some people and things. If you would deprive the person or thing of
something, say what you would deprive them of, based on the situation. If
you would not deprive the person or thing of something, say what you would
not deprive them of, based on the situation. Be sure to answer the question

  - Remind students that the various characters in the story have demonstrated
these themes through their dialogue and actions.


  - Briefly review some of the examples pulled from the text in the Themes Chart
from previous lessons.


  - Tell students that together they are going to write an opinion paragraph based on
the characters and themes in _The Wind in the Willows._ Ask, “What is an opinion?”


  - Explain that an opinion is a thought or belief about something. You may wish
to share an opinion of your own about something as an example, and allow a
few students to do the same.


  - Tell students that for this class opinion piece, they will choose a theme from the
story and a character they think best demonstrates that theme. Explain that
they will have to support this opinion with reasons and examples from the text.


  - Explain to students the steps of the writing process—plan, draft, edit, revise,

and publish—and tell them that today they will complete the first step: plan.
To aid in this planning step, have students refer back to the relevant written
responses to comprehension questions and to other writing activities that
relate to characters and themes.


  - Direct students to Activity Page 10.4 and the chart you prepared on chart paper.


  - Have students share ideas for which theme they would like to write about and
which character they think best exemplifies that theme. Write the theme and
character inside the central oval. You may wish to create several brainstorms
for many themes and/or characters to see which would provide the most
supported opinion.


  - As a class, think about and search for adjectives and examples from the text to
support this opinion. Write students’ words and/or phrases in the smaller ovals.


  - Tell students that they need to find at least three examples to support their
opinion. Remind them that these examples may be narration and/or dialogue.


  - Explain that if they cannot find at least three examples from the text, they
should choose another theme and/or character.


  - If you completed multiple brainstorming charts, you may wish to have the class
decide the same day which theme/character pairing is best supported by the
text to use for their opinion paragraph, or you may wish to allow students time to
think about it and decide at the beginning of the next writing session.


  - Tell students that they will complete the draft stage together in the next
lesson. Also, tell students to be thinking of a title for this opinion piece.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~

Assessment Analysis


The student scores you have been recording for both assessments will be
useful in deciding where students should be placed for Skills instruction. Once
all scores have been recorded, all Grade 3 teachers will need to meet to
place students.


A chart has been provided with specific information about the Silent
Reading Assessment.


The chart for the Silent Reading Assessment tells you about the length of each
story, the code knowledge assumed, and suggested placements for students
based on their scores. Below is an overview of how to interpret
students’ scores.


~~**SILENT READING ASSESSMENT SCORES**~~


Students who answered fewer than six questions correctly on “The Bug
Hunt” and “The Snake” have **minimal preparation** for the Grade 3 sequence
of Skills instruction. These students likely have fairly significant skills deficits
and will need to be regrouped to an earlier point of instruction in the grade
level materials. Additional information from the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment should be used to guide placement.


Students who answered six or more of the questions correctly on “Night
of Ghosts” have **adequate preparation** for Grade 3 and may enjoy reading
some trade books. Use student results from the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment to identify gaps in the mastery of specific letter-sound spellings.


Students who answer at least five questions correctly on “The Dog Show”
likely have **strong preparation** for Grade 3 and are ready to read trade
books independently.


Students who correctly answer six or more of the questions on “The Black
Diamond” have **outstanding preparation** for Grade 3 and are ready to read
trade books independently. If there are enough students performing at this
level, they may be grouped together for Skills so that they can move at a
faster pace.

**259**


**260**



In analyzing results from the **Word Reading in Isolation Assessment**,
remember that not all poor scores are the same.


 - A score in the **lower range of poorly prepared** on the one-syllable word
section of this assessment probably indicates a major problem reading the
words or spellings in question and signals the need for intensive remediation
beyond what can likely be provided within a Grade 3 classroom. However,
a score in the **lower range of poorly prepared** for multisyllable words
might result from the student not knowing a small set of letter-sound
correspondences or a less than adequate knowledge of syllabication. This
sort of problem can often be remediated in supplemental, small-group
sessions, and may not require placing the student at any earlier point in the
sequence
of instruction. A score of **poorly prepared** in the Tricky Words section will
result in the need to remediate those words and evaluate knowledge of Tricky
Words in general.


Remember that one possibility is to place the student back at an earlier
point in the grade level materials. A second possibility is to place him or
her in the Grade 3 material and then provide remedial tutoring to correct
specific problems. For example, if you can identify the specific letter-sound
correspondences causing difficulty, you may be able to practice these in
extra sessions while the student gets the Grade 3 instruction with the rest of
the class.


If you are considering grouping less-prepared students with stronger
students and teaching both groups the Grade 3 sequence, be sure to
individualize instruction during small-group time to meet all students’ needs.


If you feel you will be unable to provide such additional support sessions,
this may be a reason for regrouping the less-prepared students to an earlier
point in the grade level materials.

~~**ANALYZING STUDENT SKILLS SCORES FOR SKILLS PLACEMENT**~~


Once you have administered and scored all assessments, enter students’ scores
on the Placement Planning Chart found at the end of Lesson 6. Consideration of
these scores is critical in determining what Skills instruction students need and
how to group students to facilitate the best delivery of this instruction.


We highly recommend that all Grade 3 teachers meet as a grade level team
to examine students’ scores across the entire grade level, rather than having
each teacher examine only the scores of students in his or her own classroom.
Homogeneous grouping for Skills instruction is the most efficient and effective
way to differentiate instruction and meet students’ needs when teaching phonics
skills. Once the grade level team has examined the scores of all Grade 3 students
on these assessments, you may find that it makes sense to regroup some students
on the basis of their specific decoding skills for purposes of Skills instruction only.


**Note:** The Skills assessments and placement recommendations should

be used in grouping students for instruction during the Skills Strand.

These assessments should not be used for regrouping students during the

Listening and Learning Strand. In fact, all students should participate in

grade level Listening and Learning instruction, regardless of their decoding

skills. Limited decoding skills will not prevent a student from learning from

the Read-Alouds, discussions, and activities that are a part of Listening and

Learning. It is critical that all students continue to build their oral vocabulary

and content knowledge, irrespective of their decoding skills. In fact, the focus

on oral language in the Listening and Learning Strand may provide struggling

decoders with an opportunity to shine.

~~**PLACEMENT AND GROUPING GUIDELINES**~~


Grade 3 teachers should meet as a team after they have completed the
Placement Planning Chart and have assigned a group number to each
student in their class. Teachers may wish to write each student’s name and
group number on an index card for ease in grouping students. Using the
group numbers, begin sorting students from all classrooms on the basis of
their group number, using the following guidelines.






|If there is only one<br>classroom teacher per<br>grade level . . .|. . . the teacher should start all students in Groups 1 and 2 with Grade 3, Unit 2,<br>providing individualized remediation in small groups using Pausing Point activities<br>as needed. Group 3 needs intensive intervention outside the regular classroom and<br>should not start with Grade 3, Unit 2.|
|---|---|
|If there are 2 classroom<br>teachers per grade level . . .|. . . one teacher provides Skills instruction to all Group 1 and 2 students, starting with<br>Grade 3<br>, Unit 2, while the other teacher provides Skills instruction to all Group 3<br>students.**OR** …one teacher provides Skills instruction to all Group 1 students, starting<br>with Grade 3<br>, Unit 2; the other teacher should provide Skills instruction to all Group 2<br> <br>students, starting with Grade 3<br>, Unit 2; and all Group 3 students, who need intensive<br>intervention outside the regular classroom would not start with Grade 3, Unit 2 but<br>rather be provided the needed intervention.|
|If there are 3 classroom<br>teachers per grade level . . .|. . . one teacher provides Skills instruction to all Group 1 students, starting with Grade<br>3, Unit 2; another teacher provides Skills instruction to all Group 2 students, starting<br>with Grade 3, Unit 2; and the third teacher provides Skills instruction to all Group 3<br>students, who need intensive intervention|
|If there are 4 classroom<br>teachers per grade level . . .|. . . one teacher provides Skills instruction to all Group 1 students, starting with<br>Grade 3, Unit 2; another teacher provides Skills instruction to the high-level Group 2<br>students, starting with Grade 3<br>, Unit 2; a third teacher provides Skills instruction to<br>the lower-level Group 2 students, starting with Grade 3, Unit 2; and the fourth teacher<br>provides Skills instruction to all Group 3 students, who need intensive intervention.|



Lesson 10 The Further Adventures of Toad, Part I
**265**


**266**



These grouping guidelines are only a starting point; other variables, such as
the number of students across the grade level in any given group, will also
be considered. If there are disproportionately larger numbers of one or more
particular groups of students, these guidelines will need to be modified to
ensure that no one teacher has a disproportionately larger class size within
the basic guidelines of placement suggestions.


~~**ANALYZING ASSESSMENT**~~


Once students have been grouped and placed, teachers are encouraged
to conduct a more refined error analysis of student performance on the
various assessments as suggested below in order to better tailor small group
instruction to meet individual students’ needs.


 - **Word Reading in Isolation Assessment** —See error analysis for each

student as documented on the Scoring Sheet for Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment, Worksheet 7.5. Provide specific remediation for the letter-sound
correspondences and/or Tricky Words missed.


 - **Silent Reading Assessments** —See errors on the comprehension

worksheets for the assessments completed by students. Provide support in
modeling how to answer multiple-choice comprehension questions (both
literal and inferential) during small-group meetings with students.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Review with students the themes and literary tools they have learned about
so far.


  - You may wish to revisit the Themes Chart and add examples to it based on
examples from the text.


  - Ask students to turn to a partner and describe briefly what happened in the
previous lesson.


  - Toad is wearing a disguise. As we read today, we’ll think about the author’s
purpose for putting toad in a disguise. What is the lesson or message?


  - Explain: A disguise allows someone to change what they look like or act like.

A disguise does not change who you are, but it makes it difficult for people to
recognize you.


  - Also review with students the word _conceited._ Ask, “Would you describe
Toad as conceited? Why or why not?” Be sure to have students use the word
_conceited_ when they talk about it.


  - Explain to students that in the Read-Aloud today, Toad is even more
conceited than usual.


  - Share with students the title of the Read-Aloud, “The Further Adventures of
Toad, Part II.”

 - Ask students to predict what adventures Toad will experience in today’s
Read-Aloud.


~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L11.1**

Toad on horseback


Toad had traveled some miles, his

horse and he, and he was feeling

drowsy in the hot sunshine, when the

horse stopped, and began to nibble

the grass; and Toad, waking up, just saved himself from falling off.

He looked about him and found he was on a wide common. Near him

stood a gypsy caravan and beside it was a man sitting on an upturned

bucket. A fire of sticks was burning nearby, and over the fire hung an

iron pot, and from out of that pot came rich and varied smells. Toad

was hungry. He looked the gypsy over carefully, wondering whether

it would be easier to fight him or persuade him. So there he sat, and

sniffed and looked at the gypsy; and the gypsy sat and looked at him.

~~Who remembers what a gypsy is? And what is a caravan? (Gypsies,~~

~~or Romani, are wandering people who originally came from northern~~

~~India. A caravan is a large covered wagon that’s used as a traveling~~

~~home.)~~


Presently the gypsy remarked, “Want to sell that there horse of yours?”


Toad was completely taken aback. Nevertheless, the gypsy’s

suggestion seemed to smooth the way towards the two things he

wanted—money and breakfast.


“What?” he said. “Me sell this beautiful young horse? O, no! Besides,

I’m too fond of him. All the same, how much might you be willing to

offer me?


The gypsy looked the horse over. “Shillin’ a leg,” he said briefly, and

turned away. ~~A shilling is a British coin.~~


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“A shilling a leg?” cried Toad. “If you please, I must take a little time to

work that out.”


He climbed down off his horse, and did sums on his fingers, and

at last he said, “A shilling a leg? Why, that comes to exactly four

shillings. That is simply not enough.”


“Well,” said the gypsy, “I’ll tell you what I will do. I’ll make it five

shillings, and that’s more than the animal’s worth.”


Then Toad sat and pondered. He was **keenly** aware that he was

hungry and penniless. At last he said firmly, “Look here! You give me

six shillings and sixpence, and as much breakfast as I can eat. In

return, I will hand over my horse.”


**Show Image U1.L11.2**

Toad buys breakfast


The gypsy grumbled but in the end

he counted out six shillings and

sixpence into Toad’s open paw. Then

he disappeared into the caravan and

returned with a large iron plate. He

tilted up the pot, and a stream of hot rich stew gurgled onto the plate.

Toad took the plate on his lap. He thought that he had never eaten so

good a breakfast in all his life.


When Toad had eaten as much stew as he possibly could, he got

up and said good-bye to the gypsy and the horse. After receiving

directions from the gypsy, he set forth on his travels again.


As he tramped along, he thought of his adventures, and how when

things seemed at their worst, he had always found a way out. Toad’s

pride and conceit began to swell within him. “Ho, ho!” he said to

himself, “what a clever Toad I am!” He got so puffed up with conceit

that he made up a song as he walked in praise of himself, and sang it

at the top of his voice, though there was no one to hear it but him.


Lesson 11 The Further Adventures of Toad, Part II
**273**


Challenge


Have you heard the saying
“Pride goes before a fall”?
What do you think is going
to happen?


**274**



_The world has held great Heroes,_

_As history books have showed;_

_But never a name to go down to fame_

_Compared with that of Toad!_


_The clever men at Oxford_

_Know all that there is to be knowed._

_But they none of them know one half as much_

_As intelligent Mr. Toad!_


~~The University of Oxford is a world-renowned university in Great~~

~~Britain. Is~~ ~~_knowed_~~ ~~a word? The author is using humor here because~~

~~he has just mentioned Oxford, a place where many intelligent people~~

~~have studied.~~


_The animals sat in the Ark and cried,_

_Their tears in torrents flowed._

_Who was it said, ‘There’s land ahead’?_

_Encouraging Mr. Toad!_


_The army all saluted_

_As they marched along the road._

_Was it the King? Or President?_

_No. It was Mr. Toad!_


He sang as he walked, and got more inflated every minute. But his

pride was shortly to have a severe fall.


After a while, Toad reached the main road, and there he saw

approaching him a speck that turned into a dot, and then into

something very familiar.


“This is the life again,” said the excited Toad. “I will hail my brothers of

the wheel, and they will give me a lift!”


He stepped confidently out into the road, when suddenly he became

very pale. His knees shook, and he collapsed. And well he might; for

the approaching car was the very one he had previously stolen!


He sank down in a miserable heap in the road, murmuring to himself,

“It’s all over!”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


**Show Image U1.L11.3**

Toad thinks the jig is up


The motorcar drew slowly nearer, till at

last he heard it stop just short of him.

Two gentlemen got out and walked

round the heap lying in the road, and

one of them said, “O dear! Here is a poor old thing—a washerwoman

apparently—who has fainted in the road! Let us take her to the

nearest village.”


They tenderly lifted Toad into the motorcar and proceeded on their way.


When Toad heard them talk so kindly, he cautiously opened first one

eye and then the other.


“Look!” said one of the gentlemen, “she is better already. How do you

feel now, ma’am?”


“Thank you kindly, Sir,” said Toad in a feeble voice, “I’m feeling a great

deal better!”


“Now don’t try to talk,” said the gentleman.


~~The gentlemen use the words “washerwoman”, “ma’am”, and~~

~~“woman” to describe Toad. These words are used because the men~~

~~have been tricked by Toad’s disguise.~~


“I won’t,” said Toad. “I was only thinking, if I might sit on the front seat

there, beside the driver, where I could get the fresh air full in my face,

I should soon be all right again.”


“What a sensible woman!” said the gentleman. “Of course you shall.”

So they helped Toad into the front seat beside the driver.


Toad was now almost himself again. He sat up, and tried to beat down

the old cravings that rose up and took possession of him.


“It is fate!” he said to himself. “Why struggle?” and he turned to the

driver at his side.


Lesson 11 The Further Adventures of Toad, Part II
**275**


**276**



“Please, Sir,” he said, “would you kindly let me try and drive the car? I

should like to be able to tell my friends that I have had the privilege!”


The driver laughed at the **proposal** so heartily that the gentleman

inquired what the matter was. When he heard, he said, to Toad’s

delight, “I like your **spirit** . Let her have a try.”


Toad scrambled into the seat vacated by the driver, took the steering

wheel in his hands, listened with affected humility to the instructions,

and set the car in motion.


The gentlemen behind applauded, and Toad heard them saying,

“Fancy a washerwoman driving a car as well as that, the first time!”


Toad went a little faster.


He heard the gentlemen call out warningly, “Be careful,

washerwoman!” And this annoyed him, and he became angry.


The driver tried to interfere, but the Toad made the car speed even

faster. “Washerwoman, indeed!” he shouted **recklessly.** “I am the

Toad who always escapes! Sit still and you shall know what driving

really is!”


With a cry of horror the whole party rose and flung themselves on

him. “Seize him!” they cried.


**Show Image U1.L11.4**

Yet another smash-up, courtesy of Toad


Alas! They should have remembered to

stop the motorcar before attempting

to seize Toad. With a turn of the

wheel the Toad sent the motorcar

crashing through a hedge. One mighty bound, and the wheels of the

car were churning up the thick mud of a horsepond.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


Toad found himself flying through the air. He eventually landed on his

back in the soft grass of a meadow. Sitting up, he could just see the

motorcar in the pond; the gentlemen and the driver were floundering

in the water.


He picked himself up, and set off running across country as hard as

he could. He ran till he was breathless and weary, and had to go at a

slower pace. When he had recovered his breath, he began to laugh.

“Ho, ho!” he cried, in **elation** and self-admiration, “Toad, as usual,

comes out on the top!”


Then he burst into song again. A slight noise at a distance behind him

made him turn his head and look. O horror!


About two fields off, the chauffeur, or driver, and two large policemen

were visible, running towards him.


Toad sprang to his feet and pelted away again. “O, my!” he gasped, as

he ran. “What a _fool_ I am! What a _conceited numpty!”_


Toad glanced back, and saw that they were **gaining** on him. On he ran

desperately. He did his best, but his legs were short. Ceasing to heed

where he was going, he struggled on wildly, when suddenly the earth

failed under his feet. The Toad grasped at the air, and, splash! He

found himself head over ears in deep water. He had run straight into

the river!


**Show Image U1.L11.5**

Toad back on the river


Toad rose to the surface and tried to

grasp the reeds, but the stream was

so strong that it tore them out of his

hands. “O my!” gasped poor Toad. “If

ever I steal a motorcar again!”—then down he went, and came up

spluttering.



Support


_Numpty_ is the Scottish
word for idiot or fool.
Remember, Kenneth
Grahame, the author, was
born in Scotland.

**278**



Presently he saw that he was approaching a big dark hole in the bank,

just above his head. As the stream bore him past it, he reached up with a

hand and caught hold of the edge. Then slowly he drew himself up out of

the water, till he was able to rest his elbows on the edge of the hole.


As he stared before him into the dark hole, some bright small thing

twinkled in its depths. As it approached, a face grew up gradually

around it, and it was a familiar face!


Brown and small, with whiskers.


It was the Water Rat!


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Were your predictions correct about what adventures Toad has?

Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


2. **Literal.** At the beginning of today’s Read-Aloud, we find Mr. Toad riding away

on a stolen horse. He’s tired and keenly hungry. What does he do next?


» He sells the horse to a gypsy for six shillings and sixpence and breakfast.


3. **Inferential.** How does Toad act conceited in today’s Read-Aloud?


» He sings a song about how wonderful he is in “elation and self-admiration”; he

congratulates himself several times, drives recklessly and brags about it; etc.


4. **Inferential.** As Toad is walking along the road, a motorcar passes by. Who is

in the motorcar?


» The same people he had stolen from before.


Why don’t they recognize him?


» He is still dressed like a washerwoman.


5. **Inferential.** Describe how Toad feels when he recognizes the motorcar and

the people in it.


» He becomes pale, his knees shake, and he collapses.


Why does Toad feel this way?


» He is afraid the people are going to recognize him and turn him into the police.


6. **Literal.** How does Toad manage to get behind the wheel of that motorcar

once more?


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


» The passengers put Mr. Toad in the motorcar to bring him to the nearest village.

When Toad realizes they don’t recognize him, he asks them if he can drive. The

gentleman thinks it’s a funny proposal, and says he likes Toad’s spirit. And so he

let Toad take the wheel of the car.


7. **Evaluative.** Once Toad is in the driver’s seat, he drives recklessly. Retell this

part of the story from the perspective of the men in the car.


» Answers may vary.


8. **Inferential.** Why does Toad run straight into the river after getting out of the

horse pond?


» The chauffeur, or driver, and the policemen are chasing him and gaining on him;

Toad is looking back and not paying attention when the ground drops off, and he

falls into the river.


Check for Understanding


**Evaluative.** Toad is very conceited and irresponsible. Do you think Toad
will ever learn from his mistakes? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


9. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ At the end of the Read-Aloud, Toad

encounters Rat. Will Rat “let bygones be bygones”? Or is Toad too much of

a “rotten apple”?


» Answers may vary.


~~**WORD WORK: RECKLESSLY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _recklessly_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You
may review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the story today, Toad shouts _recklessly_ when he reveals that he is not a
washerwoman, but “the Toad who always escapes!”


3. Say the word _recklessly_ with me.


4. When people do something recklessly, they are doing it carelessly, without
thinking about how it will affect themselves or others around them.


Lesson 11 The Further Adventures of Toad, Part II
**279**


**280**



5. Jimmy recklessly climbed the maple tree, even though the branches looked
like they might break at any moment.


6. Over the past few days, you have heard about the adventures of Toad. What
kinds of things have you heard about that he has done recklessly? Be sure
to use the word _recklessly_ when you tell about them. (Ask two or three
students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make
complete sentences: “Toad. . . _recklessly_ . . .”)


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _recklessly_ ?


 - Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up. Directions: Say, “I am going to
read a series of situations. If the person in the situation is acting recklessly,
say, ‘He or she is acting recklessly!’ If the person in the situation is not acting
recklessly, say, ‘He or she is not acting recklessly.’”


1. Abigail ran out into the road without looking both ways. _(She is_
_acting recklessly!)_


2. Monica jumped into the river even though her mother told her it was
dangerous. _(She is acting recklessly!)_


3. Tom made sure to put on his helmet before riding his bike. _(He is not_
_acting recklessly.)_


4. Gary tried to climb the very tall fence to get into the park when it was closed.

_(He is acting recklessly!)_


5. Tina walked carefully around the side of the pool because it was wet and
slippery. _(She is not acting recklessly.)_

Writing


**Primary Focus:** With assistance, students will draft an opinion paragraph.

~~**TEKS 3.7.B; TEKS 3.11.B.i; TEKS 3.12.C; TEKS 3.2.D**~~



30m



~~**WRITING AN OPINION PARAGRAPH: DRAFT (30 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.12.C**~~


  - Remind students of the steps of the writing process—plan, draft, revise, edit,
and publish.


  - Remind them that in the previous lesson they completed the plan step of
their opinion piece.


  - Tell students that today they are going to complete the next step: draft.


  - Display the brainstorming chart(s) you previously created as a class. If you
created multiple charts, discuss which theme and character the class would like
to use for the opinion piece based on the supporting examples found in the text.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and answers
legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all assignments
in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


  - Direct students to Activity Page 11.8. Tell students they should complete this
activity page while you are completing the prepared chart.


  - Tell students that today they are going to use the words and phrases from
their brainstorming plan to create sentences for their draft.


  - Have students share ideas for a title, and display these ideas. Tell students

that you will revisit these when the draft is finished to see if one of them is a
fitting choice.


  - Tell students that the first thing they are going to write in their draft is the

topic sentence. Ask students, “Who can tell me what a topic sentence is?”
Explain that a topic sentence is the first sentence in the paragraph that tells
the reader the key idea that the writer is going to write about.


  - Tell students that in an opinion paragraph, this sentence includes the writer’s

opinion about his or her topic. In this case, the topic sentence will state
an opinion about the chosen theme and character. For example, a topic
sentence for this opinion paragraph may be, “I think Mole is the best example
of the theme of friendship in this story.”


**TEKS 3.7.B** Write a response to a literary or informational text that demonstrates an understanding of a text; **TEKS 3.11.B.i**
Develop drafts into a focused, structured, and coherent piece of writing by organizing with purposeful structure including an

- Next, tell students that they are going to choose the three best reasons from
the brainstorming chart they created together that support their opinion.
Explain that they may include more than three reasons, but three is the
minimum needed. For example, a reason that supports their topic sentence
may be, “Mole is a good friend because he is always willing to help others.”


- Tell students that after each reason, they will provide an example, such as
“Mole offers to pack up the picnic basket after he and Rat have lunch.” Guide
students in generating three reasons and three examples. Explain that these
reasons and examples should be written down in chronological order as
they relate to the plot. Encourage students to use linking words between
the different reasons and examples, such as _then, as, because, also, for_
_example, such as,_ etc. Explain that sometimes the reason and example may be
combined into one sentence. For example, “Mole is a good friend because he is
always willing to help others, such as when he offers to pack the picnic lunch.”


- As you write these sentences in the middle six rectangles, tell students
that you are using capital letters at the beginning of your sentences and
punctuation at the end. If applicable, tell students that you are using commas
between things in a list. Tell students that they will check the grammar and
spelling during the edit step, but that they should try to pay attention to
these things as they are writing their draft as well.


- Finally, tell students that the last rectangle is for the concluding sentence.
Ask, “Who can tell me what a concluding sentence is?”


- Remind students that this is the last sentence in the paragraph that wraps
up, or concludes, the information, and often restates the topic sentence in
another way. Have students share ideas for a concluding sentence and write
these down. Choose a sentence together, and write it in the last rectangle. As
you write this sentence, remind students that this sentence lets the reader
know that the writer is finished with the key idea stated in the topic sentence,
and that it does not introduce any new supporting information.


- Tell students that because the concluding sentence often restates the topic
sentence, this is a good opportunity to use synonyms, or words that have
similar meanings, such as _demonstrates_ or _exemplifies_ instead of _represents._







Read the completed paragraph to the class. Revisit the list of title ideas

to see if any of them are a fitting choice. Tell students that you are going
to continue to work on this draft together during the next writing session.
Encourage students to be thinking of any other title ideas and other changes
that they think are needed in the paragraph.

**Primary Focus:** Students will review spellings for ‘g’ and ‘c’.


~~**SPELLINGS ‘G’ AND ‘C’ (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.A.i**~~


**Spelling ‘g’**



~~**TEKS 3.2.A.i**~~




- Remind students that some spellings, called Tricky Spellings, can be
pronounced more than one way.


- Show the Spelling Card for ‘g’ as a spelling for /g/. Remind students that
they have already learned that ‘g’ can be pronounced /g/. Using the following
steps, draw the chart below to illustrate the spelling ‘g’.



**/g/**



**/j/**

**g**



**284**




  - Begin by writing _got_ on the board in cursive under the left side of the chart
marked /g/.


  - Underline the ‘g’ in _got_ as you write it. Pronounce the word _got._


  - Repeat the process with the words _gum_ and _big_ .


  - Read the words aloud. Ask students what sound the letter ‘g’ makes in these
three words.


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text; **TEKS 3.2.A.i** Demonstrate and
apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns such as eigh, ough, and en.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


- Point out that the spelling ‘g’ is pronounced /g/ in these words.


- Explain that ‘g’ can also be pronounced /j/.


- Begin by writing _gem_ on the board in cursive under the right side of the chart
marked /j/.


- Underline the ‘g’ in _gem_ as you write it. Pronounce the word _gem._


- Repeat the process with the words _tragic_ and _legend_ .


- Read the words aloud. Ask students what sound the letter ‘g’ makes in these
three words.


- Point out that the spelling ‘g’ is pronounced /j/ in these words. Explain that
‘g’ is often pronounced /j/ when it is followed by the letter ‘e’ or the letter ‘i’.


- Tell students that to figure out how to pronounce this spelling, they may need
to try sounding it out two different ways.


- Explain that /g/ is the most likely pronunciation option and therefore the one

they should try first.


- If that does not sound right, or does not make sense in context, they should
try option 2, /j/.


- Tell students to turn to **page 1** of the **Individual Code Chart.**


- Have students turn to Activity Page 11.2.


- Read the example words on the left of the page: _got_, _gum_, _big._ Point out the
/g/ sound in these words. Have students underline the ‘g’ in the words.


- Read the example words on the right of the page: _gem, tragic, legend._ Review
that it is the /j/ sound because ‘g’ is followed by ‘i’ or ‘e’. Have students
underline the ‘g’ in the words.


- Have students find and underline the ‘g’ in the word in the first sentence.


- Read the first sentence on the worksheet, pronouncing the spelling /g/: “He
did a /m/ /a/ / **g** / /i/ /k/ trick.” Ask if that sounds right. Explain that since
/m/ /a/ / **g** / /i/ /k/ sounds wrong, students need to try pronouncing it the
second way.


- Read the sentence again, pronouncing the spelling /j/: “He did a /m/ /a/ / **j** /
/i/ /k/ trick.” Point out that ‘i’ follows ‘g’. Ask if that sounds right.


- Write _magic_ in the /j/ column to indicate that the ‘g’ in _magic_ is pronounced
like the ‘g’ in _gem_ .


- Work through the remaining sentences on the activity page, having students

first find and underline ‘g’ in the words on their own. Then, call on students
to read each sentence aloud, try the tricky spelling both ways, choose the
pronunciation that sounds right and/or makes sense, and print the word in
the correct column. Help students select a word from the box and use it in
their own sentence for number 5. Model saying a sentence with one of the
words aloud. Remind students to use their best cursive handwriting.

 - Show Spelling Card ‘c’ as a spelling for /k/. Remind the students that they
have already learned that ‘c’ can be pronounced /k/.


 - Using the following steps, draw the chart below to illustrate the spelling ‘c’.



**/k/**



**/s/**



Activity Page 11.5




- Begin by writing _can_ on the board in cursive under the left side of the chart
marked /k/.


- Underline the ‘c’ in _can_ as you write it. Pronounce the word _can_ .


- Repeat the process with the words _cap_ and _cot_ .


- Read the words aloud. Ask students what sound the letter ‘c’ makes in these
three words.


- Point out that the spelling ‘c’ is pronounced /k/ in these words.


- Explain that ‘c’ can also be pronounced /s/.


- Explain that ‘c’ is often pronounced /s/ when it is followed by the letters ‘e’ or
‘i’, as in words like _cent_ and _citrus._


- Begin by writing _cent_ on the board in cursive under the right side of the chart
marked /s/.


- Underline ‘c’ in the word _cent_, and pronounce it /s/. Pronounce the word _cent_ .


- Repeat the process with the words _citrus_ and _cell_ .


- Point out that the spelling ‘c’ is pronounced /s/ in these words.


- Explain that /k/ is the most likely pronunciation option and therefore the one

that students should try first. If that does not sound right, or does not make
sense in context, they should try option 2, /s/.


- Tell students to turn to **page 2** of the **Individual Code Chart.**


- Show the students the ‘c’ > /s/ ( _cent_ ) Spelling Card for /s/. Remember to
point out and discuss the power bar for each spelling.


- Have students locate Activity Page 11.5.


- Explain that the letters in slashes stand for sounds.

**286**


  - Have students underline the ‘c’ in the example words: can, cap, and cot.
Review the /k/ sound.


  - Have students underline the ‘c’ in the example words: cent, citrus, and cell.
Review the /s/ sound.


  - Have students find and underline ‘c’ in the word in the first sentence.


  - Read the first sentence on the activity page, pronouncing the spelling /k/:
“The king got the /p/ /r/ /i/ /n/ / **k** / /e/ /s/ a kitten.”


  - Ask students if that sounds right.


  - Explain that since /p/ /r/ /i/ /n/ / **k** / /e/ /s/ does not sound right, students
need to try it the second way.


  - Read the sentence again, pronouncing the tricky spelling /s/: “The king got
the /p/ /r/ /i/ /n/ / **s** / /e/ /s/ a kitten.”


  - Ask students if that sounds right. _(Yes,_ princess _is a word and it makes sense_
_in this context since a princess is the daughter of a king.)_


  - Show students how to write _princess_ in the “cent” column to indicate that the
‘c’ in _princess_ is pronounced like the ‘c’ in _cent._


  - Work through the remaining sentences on the worksheet, asking students to
underline the ‘c’. Call on students to read the sentences aloud, try the spelling
both ways, choose the pronunciation that sounds right and/or makes sense,
and print the word in the correct column. Help students select a word from
the box and use it in their own sentence. Model saying a sentence with one of
the words aloud. Remind students to use their best cursive handwriting.


  - When students have completed the worksheet, ask them which
pronunciation seems to be more common. _(/k/ is more common)_


**Note:** Distribute the decodable passage, “Summary of ‘The Further
Adventures of Toad, Part II, ‘” that you prepared in advance for students
to practice reading independently when finished with the Activity Pages.
Remind students that the passage uses /g/, /j/, /k/, and /c/ sounds they
learned about today.

Review the plot from the previous lesson by showing images and asking the

following questions:


 - What are examples of how Toad acts conceited?


 - Whom does Toad come across in the previous lesson?


 - How does Toad end up in the water?



Support


Have students explain
what personification is and
provide an example from a
previous reading.




  - Review with students the literary tools (i.e., perspective, point of view,

narration, etc.) and themes they have learned about thus far. You may wish
to revisit the Themes Chart and add any new examples from the previous
Read-Aloud.


  - Tell students they will meet some new—as well as revisit some old—animal
characters from the Wild Wood in today’s Read-Aloud. Tell students they will
hear about weasels, ferrets, and stoats (more commonly known as _ermine_ ).


  - Tell students that these animals are personified, just like Rat, Mole, Badger,

and Toad.


  - Tell students to listen carefully to the story to hear which aspects of their

characteristics are personified, and which ones are true to nature and
not personified.


Lesson 12 The Return of Toad, Part I

Explain


A disguise allows
someone to change what
they look like or act like. A

disguise does not change
who you are, but it makes

it difficult for people to

recognize you.


**292**




 - Share with students the title of today’s Read-Aloud, “The Return of Toad, Part
I.” Remind students that at the end of the previous Read-Aloud, Toad runs right
into the river and then finds himself in front of Water Rat.


 - Ask students if they remember what happened the last time Toad saw Water

Rat. If students have difficulty, remind them that the last time Toad saw
Water Rat, Toad lied to Rat about being ill so he could escape.


 - Ask students the following questions:


   - How do you think Rat feels after Toad tricks him and escapes Toad Hall?
Do you think Rat is happy to see Toad?


   - How would you feel if a friend lied to you and tricked you? Would you “let
bygones be bygones”?


   - Do you think Rat will be willing to help Toad in the Read-Aloud today? Why
or why not?


 - Tell students to listen carefully to find out if their predictions are correct.


~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L12.1**

The return of Toad


The Rat put out a neat little brown

paw, gripped Toad firmly by the scruff

of the neck, and gave a great hoist and

a pull. The waterlogged Toad came up

slowly but surely over the edge of the hole. At last he stood safe and

sound in the hall, streaked with mud and weed, and with the water

streaming off him.


“O, Ratty!” he cried. “I’ve been through such times since I saw you last.”


“Toad,” said the Water Rat firmly, “you go off upstairs at once, and

take off that old cotton rag that looks as if it once belonged to a

washerwoman. Clean yourself, and put on some of my clothes. Now

be off! I’ll have something to say to you later!”


Toad was at first inclined to do some talking back. He had had enough

of being ordered about. However, he caught sight of himself in the


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


looking-glass, with the bonnet perched over one eye, and he changed

his mind. He went very quickly upstairs to the Rat’s dressing room.

There he had a thorough wash, and changed his clothes.


**Show Image U1.L12.2**

Rat and Toad catch up over lunch


By the time he came down again

luncheon was on the table. While

they ate, Toad told the Rat about his

adventures.


When at last Toad had talked himself to a standstill, there was silence

for a while; and then the Rat said, “Now, Toady, on your own admission

you have been handcuffed, **imprisoned**, starved, chased, terrified out

of your life, insulted, jeered at, and flung into the water—by a woman,

too! Don’t you see what a fool you’ve been making of yourself? And all

because you stole a motorcar.”


Toad heaved a deep sigh and said, very humbly, “Quite right, Ratty!

I can quite see that; but now I’m going to be a good Toad. As for

motorcars, I’ve not been so keen on them for quite a while. I have

something else in mind, but all in good time. Let’s have our coffee,

and then I’ll stroll down to Toad Hall.”


“Stroll down to Toad Hall?” cried the Rat, greatly excited. “Do you

mean to say you haven’t _heard_ ?”


“Heard what?” said Toad, turning rather pale.


“Do you mean to tell me,” shouted the Rat, “that you’ve heard nothing

about the stoats and weasels?”


What, the Wild Wooders?” cried Toad, trembling in every limb. “What

have they been doing?”


“—And how they’ve been and taken Toad Hall?” continued the Rat.


Toad leaned his elbows on the table, and a large tear welled up in

each of his eyes.

“Go on, Ratty,” he murmured presently; “tell me all.”


“When you—got—into that—that—trouble of yours,” said the Rat.


Toad merely nodded.


“Well, it was a good deal talked about,” explained the Rat. “The River
Bankers stuck up for you. But the Wild Wood animals said it served you

right, and they went about saying you would never come back again!”


Toad nodded once more.


“The Mole and the Badger insisted that you would come back again,

somehow!”


Toad began to sit up in his chair again, and to smirk a little.


“They were so sure that you would never be seen again,” continued

the Rat, “that they arranged to move their things into Toad Hall. And

so, one dark night, a band of weasels crept silently up the driveway.

Simultaneously, a body of desperate ferrets took possession of

the kitchen garden, the backyard, and offices; while a company of

skirmishing stoats occupied the conservatory and the billiard room.”


**Show Image U1.L12.3**

Toad learns of the fate of Toad Hall


“The Mole and the Badger were sitting

by the fire when those bloodthirsty

villains broke down the doors and

rushed in upon them. They were

unarmed, and taken by surprise. Those two poor faithful creatures

were turned out into the cold. The Wild Wooders have been living in

Toad Hall ever since,” concluded the Rat.


“O, have they!” said Toad getting up and seizing a stick.“I’ll see about that!”


“It’s no good, Toad!” called the Rat after him. “You’d better come back

and sit down; you’ll only get into trouble.”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


But the Toad was off. He marched rapidly down the road, fuming and

muttering to himself till he got near his front gate. At that moment

there popped up from behind the palings a long, yellow ferret with a

gun. ~~Palings are fences made out of pointed stakes.~~


“Who comes there?” said the ferret sharply.


“Stuff and nonsense!” said Toad, very angrily. “What do you mean by

talking like that to me? Come out of that at once, or I’ll—”


The ferret said never a word, but he brought his gun up to his

shoulder. Toad prudently dropped flat in the road, and _bang_ ! A bullet

whistled over his head.


The **startled** Toad scrambled to his feet and scampered off as hard

as he could.


He went back, very crestfallen, and told the Water Rat.


“What did I tell you?” said the Rat. “They’ve got **sentries** posted, and

they are all armed. You must just wait.”


Still, Toad was not inclined to give in all at once. So he got out the

boat, and set off rowing up the river to where the garden front of Toad

Hall came down to the waterside.


Arriving within sight of his old home, he **surveyed** the land cautiously.

All seemed very peaceful and quiet. He could see the whole front

of Toad Hall, glowing in the evening sunshine. He would try the

boathouse first, he thought. Very **warily** he paddled up to the mouth

of the creek, and was just passing under the bridge, when . . . crash!


**Show Image U1.L12.4**

Toad scouts out Toad Hall from the river


A great stone, dropped from above,

smashed through the bottom of the

boat. The boat filled and sank, and Toad

found himself struggling in deep water.


Lesson 12 The Return of Toad, Part I
**295**


**296**



“It will be your head next time, Toady!” the stoats called out to him. The

**indignant** Toad swam to shore, while they laughed and laughed.


The Toad retraced his weary way on foot, and related his

disappointing experiences to the Water Rat once more.


“Well, _what_ did I tell you?” said the Rat very crossly. “And, now, look here!

See what you’ve been and done! Lost me my boat that I was so fond of!”


The Toad saw at once how foolishly he had acted. He admitted his

errors and made a full apology to Rat. “Ratty! I see that I have been

a headstrong and a willful Toad! Henceforth, I will take no action

without your advice and full approval!”


“If that is really so,” said the good-natured Rat, already appeased, “then

my advice to you is to have some supper. In addition, do nothing until

we have seen the Mole and the Badger, and taken their advice.”


“Oh, ah, yes, of course, the Mole and the Badger,” said Toad. “What’s

become of them, the dear fellows?”


“Well may you ask!” said the Rat reproachfully. “While you were riding

about the country in expensive motorcars, those two poor devoted

animals were trying every which way to get your property back for

you. You don’t deserve to have such loyal friends!”


“I’m an ungrateful beast, I know,” sobbed Toad, shedding bitter tears.

“Let me go out and find them, out into the cold, dark night—Hold on a

bit! Surely I heard the chink of dishes on a tray! Supper’s here at last,

hooray! Come on, Ratty!”


They had just finished their meal when there came a heavy knock at

the door. ~~Who do you think is at the door?~~


Toad was nervous, but the Rat, nodding mysteriously at him, went

straight up to the door and opened it, and in walked Mr. Badger.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


**Show Image U1.L12.5**

Mr. Badger arrives


Mr. Badger looked decidedly bedraggled.

He came solemnly up to Toad, shook him

by the paw, and said, “Welcome home,

Toad! Alas! This is a poor homecoming.”

Then he turned his back on him and helped himself to a large slice of pie.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Were your predictions correct? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


2. **Evaluative.** Briefly describe what Toad has gone through since he’s last

seen his friends, and how he feels after he tells Rat about his adventures.

Does he want to go on any more?


» no


Why or why not?


» Toad has been handcuffed, imprisoned, starved, chased, terrified for his life,

insulted, jeered at, and flung into the water by a woman—and all because he stole

a motorcar. Toad says he’s had enough adventures. He regrets being conceited.


Do you think there is a chance that Toad will actually change his ways?


» Answers may vary.


3. **Inferential.** What happens to Toad Hall while Toad is gone? Who moves in?


» weasels, ferrets, and stoats


Why?


» They didn’t think Toad was ever coming back, and they didn’t support Toad’s

irresponsibility.


4. **Literal.** What happens each time Toad goes to his home to try to get it back

from the weasels, ferrets, and stoats?


» The first time, Toad is startled when a ferret tries to shoot him. The second time,

Toad uses Rat’s boat and warily tries to get to his house by river, but the stoats

drop a stone on the boat. It sinks, and an indignant Toad swims to shore.


Lesson 12 The Return of Toad, Part I
**297**


**298**



5. **Inferential.** In the Read-Aloud today, you heard that Mole and Badger

surveyed, or looked over, the outside of Toad’s home. What do they discover?


» Toad’s home is surrounded by _______(soldiers, sentries), or guards with guns.


What does that mean for Toad?


» It will be very ______ (hard, easy) to get back into Toad’s home.

~~**TEKS 3.7.C**~~
6. **Evaluative.** From whose perspective is “The Return of Toad, Part I” told?


» Toad


How would the Read-Aloud be different if it were told from the perspective of the
weasels, stoats, and ferrets?


» Answers may vary.


7. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share: At the end of the Read-Aloud, Toad is very

upset. He doesn’t think he will be able to get his house back. Imagine you

are with Toad, Rat, and Badger. What advice would you give Toad? How do

you think he could get his house back?


» Answers may vary.


8. **Inferential.** What are some additional examples of the themes of

friendship/loyalty, hospitality, responsibility, and irresponsibility in this

Read-Aloud?


» Answers may vary. Friendship/loyalty—Rat takes Toad in; Mole and Badger try

to get Toad’s house back for him. Hospitality—Rat feeds Toad lunch and dinner;

Rat gives Toad clothes and a place to stay. Irresponsibility—Toad goes to Toad

Hall without telling Rat; and he loses Rat’s boat when it is destroyed by the stoats.

Responsibility—Toad acknowledges his thoughtlessness; Toad apologizes and

promises not to take action without Rat’s advice and approval.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to identify examples of personification.


~~**WORD WORK: STARTLED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _startled_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You
may review syllable division patterns at this time.


**TEKS 3.7.C** Use text evidence to support an appropriate response.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


2. In the story today, you heard that Toad was _startled_ by the ferret with a gun.


3. Say the word _startled_ with me.


4. When people are startled, they are suddenly scared or surprised, and often
move or jump as a reaction.


5. Rachael was so startled when her sister popped out from behind the door
that she jumped.


6. Have you ever been startled? Has anyone ever been startled by you? Be sure
to use the word _startled_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students.
If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete
sentences: “I was startled once when . . .”)


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _startled_ ?


 - Use a Drawing activity for follow-up. Have students think of a time when they
were startled or when they startled someone. You may also wish to have
them come up with ideas about how they could startle someone. Have them
draw their idea and write a sentence beneath their drawing. Make sure that
students use the word _startled_ in their sentence.

~~**WRITING AN OPINION PARAGRAPH: DRAFT/REVISE (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Display the plan and draft charts created as a class based from previous lessons.


  - Remind students that they have completed the plan step of the writing process
and that today they are going to continue working on the draft step together.


  - Read the sample draft to the class. Have students share any additional
ideas they may have for a title, and add these to the list. Then, tell students
they are going to use a Revision Checklist to help them to know what other
changes need to be made to the paragraph.


  - Explain that writers often revise many, many times before they are able to
call their final manuscript writing “finished.” Explain that revising is somewhat
different from editing: Revising is often making changes to the content and/
or the order of the content, whereas editing is often making corrections to
grammar, punctuation, and spelling according to the rules of standard English.

should be in chronological order to follow the plot of the story. You may wish
to explain, however, that sometimes support sentences may be rearranged if
they are not tied to a chronological plot.


  - Explain that when this is the case, it is helpful to write the supporting
sentences onto strips and move them around to see which order helps the
paragraph flow best. Tell students that they will have the opportunity to do
this with other types of writing during future writing sessions.


  - Once revisions have been decided upon, tell students that the last part of
the draft step is to write a second draft of the paragraph, incorporating the
changes made during revision.


  - Direct students to Activity Page 12.4 and have students write the revised

Encourage students to keep thinking about any other title ideas. Tell students
they will complete the next step of the writing process—edit—together the
next time you meet to work on writing, and that you will decide on a final
title then.


  - An example opinion paragraph may follow along these lines:


**“Marvelous Mole”**


I think Mole best represents the theme of friendship in _The Wind in the Willows_ .
He is always willing to help his friends, like when he volunteers to pack the picnic
lunch after he and Rat finish eating. Mole is also willing to stay at his friends’
houses and do things the way they want to do them. He is very unselfish in this
way. Finally, Mole is a good friend because he is willing to fight for his friend Toad
to help him get his house back, even after Toad acts irresponsibly. These are the
reasons that I believe Mole is the character who best demonstrates the theme
of friendship in this story. I would love to be Mole’s friend!

Alice sat down and began to cry again. She went
on, crying gallons of tears, until there was a large pool
around her.


Then, Alice heard a pattering of feet in the
distance. It was the White Rabbit returning. He was
splendidly dressed, with a pair of white gloves in one
hand and a large fan in the other. He was muttering to
himself, “Oh, The Duchess! Won’t she be cross if I’ve
kept her waiting!”


When the Rabbit came near her, Alice tried to speak
to him.


“If you please, sir—”


The Rabbit was startled. He dropped his gloves and
his fan and scurried away into the darkness.

As she said this, Alice could see that she was
shrinking again. In another moment, splash! She was up
to her chin in water. Poor Alice was swimming in a pool
of her own tears.


“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice as she
swam about in search of a way out. Thankfully, Alice
did find a way out. She was not one for sitting still
doing nothing, so she began to wander further and
further into Wonderland.

It was at that point that she came upon a large, blue
Caterpillar. The Caterpillar was sitting on a mushroom.


Alice stood on her tiptoes and peeked over the edge
of the mushroom. Her eyes met those of the Caterpillar.
The two of them looked at each other for some time in
silence. At last, the Caterpillar asked, “Who are you?”


Alice replied, “I—I hardly know, sir. I know who
I was when I got up this morning, but I have been
changed several times since then.”


“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar
sternly. “Explain yourself!”


“I can’t explain myself, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m
not myself, you see.”


“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.


“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied.
“I find that being so many different sizes in one day is
very confusing.”



“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.



_Alice came upon the Caterpillar._

Alice felt a little irritated by the Caterpillar and she
turned away.


“Come back!” the Caterpillar called. “I’ve something
important to say!”


This sounded promising, so Alice turned and came
back again.


“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.


“Is that all?” said Alice.


In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the
mushroom. Then, he crawled away into the grass. As he
went, he said, “One side will make you grow taller. The
other side will make you grow shorter.”


“One side of what?” thought Alice to herself.


“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar.


In another moment, the Caterpillar was gone.



Alice broke off a bit of each side of the mushroom.
She ate small bites and managed to bring herself back to
her normal height.

Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus:** Students will review spelling alternatives ‘kn’, ‘wr’, ‘wh’, and ‘qu’.

~~**TEKS 3.2.A.i; TEKS 3.4**~~


~~**REVIEW SPELLING ALTERNATIVES (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today, they will review several spelling alternatives for consonant
sounds that are found mostly at the beginning of words. Write the spelling ‘kn’ on
the board and ask students, “If you saw this spelling in a word, what would you
say?” (Remind students that the spelling ‘kn’ is pronounced /n/.)


  - Once students have provided the sound(s), ask them for the letter names.


  - Show students the ‘kn’ > /n/ ( _knock_ ) Spelling Card. Have students read the
sample word. Discuss what the power bar tells us about this spelling.


  - Repeat this process for the other spellings, writing each spelling on the board
and showing student the Spelling Card. Remember to point out and discuss
the power bar for each spelling.


  - Read the first paragraph of the decodable passage, “Summary of ‘The Return
of Toad, Part I’”, aloud to the class, modeling fluent reading. Tell students
that after they complete the activity book page, they will finish reading the
passage on their own. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


Note to Teacher


/qu/ is actually two sounds, /k/ + /w/. You can either teach this to students
as two sounds or just glide over it without drawing attention to the fact that
it is actually two sounds. If you have good listeners, some of them may hear
that /qu/ is actually /k/ + /w/.


As you review these digraph spellings, you may also wish to review the sounds that
the single letters generally stand for. For example, when introducing ‘wh’, you might
cover the ‘h’, leaving only the ‘w’ visible, and ask, “What sound would you say if you
saw this in a word?” Then, you could cover the ‘w’, leaving only the ‘h’ visible, and
ask, “What sound would you say if you saw this in a word?” Then, show the digraph.


**TEKS 3.2.A.i** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling
patterns such as eigh, ough, and en; **TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading
grade-level text.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_



**312**


We encourage you to avoid speaking of “silent letters” when discussing
spellings like ‘wr’. Just say that these two letters stand for one sound, in the
same way ‘sh’ and ‘ch’ stand for one sound.


  - Have students locate Activity Page 12.2.


  - Guide students through the first two items. First, ask students to name the
picture and then circle the letters that spell the picture name. Then, ask
students to write the picture name on the line provided.


  - Model using _wrap_ in a sentence. Prompt students to turn and talk in partners
to use _knit_ in a sentence. Explain that when students complete all of the
boxes, they should select one word to write in their own sentence.


  - Have students complete the remainder of the activity page independently.


**Note:** Distribute the decodable passage for students to read independently.
Circulate and give feedback on their accuracy reading words with ‘kn’, ‘wr’,
‘wh’, and ‘qu’, and their intonation and accuracy of reading the decodable
passage.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~






  - Review the plot from the previous lesson by showing students some of
the illustrations from the previous Read-Alouds and asking the following
questions:


    - How do Rat and Badger react to Toad’s return? Do they “let bygones
be bygones”?

    - Has Toad stopped being irresponsible and conceited?

    - Who has taken over Toad Hall?

  - Review with students the literary tools (i.e., perspective, point of view,
narration, etc.) and themes they have learned about thus far. You may wish to
revisit the Themes Chart and add any new examples from the previous ReadAloud to the chart (e.g., friendship and loyalty: Rat lending Toad his boat and
trying to get Toad’s house back, despite what other animals are saying about
Toad; etc.).


  - Explain to students that you will be reading the last Read-Aloud in _The Wind_
_in the Willows_ . Ask students to predict whether or not Mr. Toad will be able to
reclaim, or take back, Toad Hall.

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U1.L13.1**
Making plans


Toad was quite alarmed at Badger’s

serious style of greeting; but the Rat

whispered to him, “Never mind; he’s

always despondent when he’s hungry.”


They waited in silence, and presently there came another knock. The

Rat, with a nod to Toad, went to the door and ushered in the Mole.


“Hooray! Here’s old Toad!” cried the Mole. “Why, you must have

managed to escape, you clever Toad!” ~~How is Mole’s reaction to Toad~~

~~different from Rat’s and Badger’s?~~


The Rat, alarmed, pulled him by the elbow; but it was too late. Toad

was puffing and swelling already.


“Clever? O, no!” Toad said. “I’m not really clever, according to my

friends. I’ve only broken out of the strongest prison in England, that’s

all! And captured a railway train and escaped on it, that’s all!”


“Well, well,” said the Mole, moving towards the supper table;

“supposing you talk while I eat. Not a bite since breakfast!” And he

sat down and helped himself to cold beef and pickles.


Toad straddled the hearth rug, thrust his paw into his trouser pocket

and pulled out a handful of silver. “Look at that!” he cried, displaying

it. “That’s not so bad, is it, for a few minutes’ work? And how do you

think I done it, Mole? Horse dealing! That’s how I done it!” ~~What’s the~~

~~right way to say, “That’s how I done it”?~~


“Go on, Toad,” said the Mole, immensely interested.


“Toad, do be quiet, please!” said the Rat.“And don’t you egg him on, Mole.

Just tell us what the position is, and what’s to be done, now that Toad is back.”


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“The position’s about as bad as it can be,” replied the Mole; “armed

**sentinels** posted everywhere at Toad Hall.”


“It’s a very difficult situation,” said the Rat, reflecting deeply. “But I

think I see what Toad really ought to do.”


“No, he oughtn’t!” shouted the Mole.


“Well, I shan’t do it, anyway!” cried Toad, getting excited. “I’m not going

to be ordered about by you fellows!” ~~Is Toad really trying to change?~~


By this time they were all three talking at once, at the top of their

voices, when a thin, dry voice made itself heard, saying, “Be quiet!”

and instantly everyone was silent.


It was the Badger.


“Toad!” he said crossly. “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? What do

you think your father would have said if he had been here tonight?”


Toad, who was on the sofa by this time, began to sob.


**Show Image U1.L13.2**

Toad breaks down


“There, there!” went on the Badger,

more kindly. “Stop crying. We’re

going to let bygones be bygones. But

what the Mole says is true. There are

guards at every point. There is no point in trying to take the place by

storm!” ~~What does Badger mean when he, Rat, and Mole say they will~~

~~“let bygones be bygones”? (They will forgive Toad and let go of what~~

~~has happened.)~~


“Then it’s all over,” sobbed the Toad, crying into the sofa cushions.

“I shall join the army.”


“Come, cheer up, Toady!” said the Badger. “There are more ways of

getting back a place than taking it by force. Now, I’m going to tell you

a secret.”

Sentinels are soldiers
or guards.



Lesson 13 The Return of Toad, Part II
**319**


**320**



Toad sat up and dried his eyes. Secrets had an **immense** attraction

for him, because he never could keep one.


“There—is—an—underground—passage,” said the Badger, “that leads

from the river bank, right up into the middle of Toad Hall.”


“O, nonsense! Badger,” said Toad. “I know every inch of Toad Hall!”


“My young friend,” said the Badger, with great severity, “your father

told me a great deal he wouldn’t have dreamt of telling you. He made

me promise not to tell you about it unless you really needed to know.”

~~Why do you think Toad’s father would tell something to Badger and~~

~~not to his own son? Is Toad responsible or irresponsible?~~


The other animals looked hard at Toad to see how he would take it.

Toad was inclined to be sulky at first; but he soon brightened up.


“Well, well,” he said. “Go on, Badger. How’s this passage of yours

going to help us?”


“I’ve found out,” continued the Badger, “that there’s going to be

a banquet tomorrow night. It’s somebody’s birthday—and all the

weasels will be gathered together in the dining hall. No weapons of

any sort!”


“But the sentinels will be posted as usual,” remarked the Rat.


“Exactly,” said the Badger; “that is my point. The weasels will trust

entirely to their guards. And that is where the passage comes in. That

tunnel leads right up under the butler’s pantry, next to the dining hall!”


**Show Image U1.L13.3**

The plan to retake Toad Hall


“We shall creep out quietly into the

butler’s pantry—” cried the Mole.


“—with our pistols and swords and

sticks—” shouted the Rat.


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


“—and rush in upon them,” said the Badger.


“—and whack ’em, and whack ’em, and whack ’em!” cried the Toad in ecstasy.


“Very well, then,” said the Badger, resuming his usual dry manner,“our plan

is settled. We will make all the necessary arrangements in the morning.”


Toad slept till a late hour next morning, and by the time he got down

he found that the other animals had already breakfasted. The Mole

had slipped off somewhere, the Badger was sitting reading the paper,

and the Rat was organizing an enormous pile of weapons.


“I think the job can be done without the need for weapons, Rat,” said

the Badger presently.


“It’s as well to be on the safe side,” said the Rat reflectively.


The Toad, having finished his breakfast, picked up a stick and swung

it vigorously about him. “I’ll learn ’em to steal my house!” he cried.


“Don’t say ‘learn ’em,’ Toad,” said the Rat. “It’s not good English.”


“What are you always nagging at Toad for?” inquired the Badger.

“What’s the matter with his English? It’s the same what I use myself,

and if it’s good enough for me, it ought to be good enough for you!”


“I’m very sorry,” said the Rat humbly. “Only _I think_ it ought to be

‘teach ’em,’ not ‘learn ’em.’”


“But we don’t _want_ to teach ’em,” replied the Badger. “We want to

_learn_ ’em! And what’s more, we’re going to _do_ it, too!”


“Oh, very well, have it your own way,” said the Rat.


Presently the Mole returned, and the four companions continued to

make plans to recapture Toad Hall.


When it began to grow dark, the Rat summoned them back into the

parlor to prepare for the coming **expedition** . When all was ready, the

Badger took a dark lantern in one paw, grasped a stick with the other,

and said, “Now then, follow me! Mole first, because I’m very pleased

with him; Rat next; Toad last!” The Toad was so anxious not to be

left out that he did not protest. ~~A dark lantern is a lantern that has a~~

~~sliding panel to dim or hide the light.~~

Badger, Mole, Rat, and Toad sneak into
Toad Hall through a secret passage


With Badger leading the way, they

soon found themselves in the secret

passage. It was cold and dark, and

Toad began to shiver. The lantern was far ahead, and he could not

help lagging behind. Then, fearful of being left alone in the dark, Toad

hurried forward and bumped into Rat. The Badger thought they were

being attacked and drew a pistol. He was on the point of putting a bullet

into Toad when he discovered what had really happened. He was very

angry, and said, “Now this time that tiresome Toad _shall_ be left behind!”


But Toad whimpered, and the other two promised to look out for him,

and at last the procession moved on.


They shuffled along till at last the Badger said, “We ought by now to

be nearly under the Hall.”


Then suddenly they heard a confused murmur of sound, as if people

were cheering.


The passage now began to slope upwards; and then the noise broke

out again, very close above them. “Ooo-ray-ooray-oo-rayooray!” they

heard, and the stamping of little feet. “ _What_ a time they’re having!”

said the Badger. “Come on!” They hurried along the passage till it

came to an end. There they found themselves standing under the

trap door that led up into the butler’s pantry.

**Show Image U1.L13.5**

Badger, Mole, Rat and Toad spring into action


Such a tremendous noise was going

on in the banqueting hall that there

was little danger of their being

overheard. The Badger said, “Now, all together!” and the four of them

put their shoulders to the trap-door and heaved it back. Hoisting

each other up, they found themselves standing in the pantry.


The noise they heard as they emerged from the passage was

**deafening** . At last, as the cheering and hammering subsided, a voice

could be heard to say, “Well, I should like to say one word about our

kind host, Mr. Toad. We all know Toad!”—(great laughter)—“ **Modest**

Toad!” (shrieks of merriment) ~~Modest means humble. Is Toad really~~

~~modest? Or do you think the Wild Wooders are being sarcastic?~~


“Just let me get at him!” muttered Toad.


“Hold hard a minute!” said the Badger, restraining him with difficulty.

“Get ready, all of you!”


The Badger drew himself up, took a firm grip of his stick, glanced

round at his comrades, and cried—“The hour is come! Follow me!”


And flung the door open wide.


My! What a squealing and a screeching filled the air!


**Show Image U1.L13.6**

Toad Hall is reclaimed


Well might the terrified weasels dive

under the tables! Well might the

ferrets rush wildly for the fireplace

and the chimney therein! Well

might tables and chairs be upset when the four Heroes strode into

the room!


Lesson 13 The Return of Toad, Part II
**323**


**324**



They were but four in all, but to the panic-stricken weasels, and

before long the stoats, Toad Hall seemed full of monstrous animals,

and they broke and fled with squeals of terror. And so, Toad Hall

was reclaimed.


“Mole, you’re the best of fellows!” declared Badger to Mole, so

impressed was he with how valiantly Mole had fought. Toad felt rather

hurt that the Badger hadn’t complimented him on how splendidly he

had fought. But Toad put aside his jealousy and thanked Mole for

his help.


“Toad,” said Badger, “you must have a banquet to celebrate.”


Thinking immediately of all the speeches he would make, and songs

he would sing about his own leading part in the fight, Toad puffed

up with conceit once more. He became so inflated that his friends

suspected right away what Toad was up to.


“Now, Toad,” said the Rat, “we want you to understand there are going

to be no speeches and no songs. Especially as your songs are all

self-praise—and—”


“And gas,” put in the Badger.


“It’s for your own good, Toady,” went on the Rat. “You know you _must_

turn over a new leaf, sooner or later.”


Toad thought a long while. “My friends, you shall never have occasion

to blush for me again,” he said. “But, O dear, this is a hard world!” And

so, he was indeed a changed Toad!


As the weeks and months went by, many tales were told of the great

siege at Toad Hall. Toad became a more thoughtful Toad, and life on

the river bank continued, as did the friendships of the creatures with

whom you have just become acquainted.

Challenge
~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (15 MIN.)**~~



1. **Evaluative.** Toad has an immense attraction to secrets, but he has always

been bad at keeping secrets. Do you think that was wise of Toad’s father?

Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


2. **Inferential.** Why do Badger and the others want to use an underground

passage?


» They need to secretly get into the house, and sentinels are posted around

the outside.


3. **Literal.** Where does the underground passageway lead?


» under the pantry in Toad’s house


How are Rat, Toad, Mole, and Badger planning to use the underground passageway?


» to sneak into the house and surprise the weasels, ferrets, and stoats; Toad is in

ecstasy about the possibility of whacking ’em!


4. **Evaluative.** Describe the tunnel passage that the animals use on their

expedition to Toad’s mansion. How would you use your senses to perceive

this hidden passage? What does it look like? Feel like? Sound like? Smell

like?


» Answers may vary.


5. **Literal.** Describe how the four animals are able to come in through the

butler’s pantry without being heard.


» The weasels, ferrets, and stoats were making a deafening amount of noise

toasting the “modest Toad,” and so didn’t hear Badger, Rat, Mole, and Toad enter

the hall.


6. **Evaluative.** Why do you think Rat tells Toad that he should “turn over a new

leaf,” or start over again in his life?


» Answers may vary, but should include examples from the text, such as Toad’s

irresponsibility; the way his actions have affected his friends with him being the

“rotten apple that spoils the barrel”; the accidents, the time in prison, the fact that

he lost his house; etc.


7. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ After the four friends get Toad’s mansion

back, Toad’s feelings are hurt because Badger compliments Mole and not

him. However, Toad compliments and thanks Mole for his help. Do you think

that Toad would have been able to put aside his jealousy and thank his

friend before all of his adventures? Do you think Toad has changed since we

first heard about him? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary, but should include examples from the text.



What does it mean to “turn
over a new leaf”?



Lesson 13 The Return of Toad, Part II
**325**


**326**



8. **Evaluative.** In real life, can an escaped prisoner simply go back to his own

home without the police arresting him again and returning him to prison?


» no


What kind of story is _The Wind in the Willows_ again, and why?


» classic fiction, because it’s an old, high-quality, well-known story


What kind of fiction is _The Wind in the Willows_ ?


» _The Wind in the Willows_ is a fantasy, because things happen in the story that

cannot happen in real life, such as animals who talk and wear clothes, or a prisoner

escaping and moving back home without being found and returned to prison.


~~**WORD WORK: MODEST (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _modest_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity for
students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You may
review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the story today, you heard that the weasels, ferrets, and stoats were
toasting _modest_ Toad, and laughing at his expense.


3. Say the word _modest_ with me.


4. If you are modest, that means you are humble and don’t show off.


5. Albert Einstein—a famous physicist, or special kind of scientist—was modest
about his many achievements, and rarely spoke of them to anyone. Do you
know someone who is modest? Who? What did they do and how do they
act? Be sure to use the word _modest_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three
students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make
complete sentences: “. . . is modest because . . .”)


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _modest_ ?


 - Use a Synonyms and Antonyms activity for follow-up. Ask, “What are some
synonyms, or words that have a similar meaning, of _modest_ ?” Prompt
students to provide words like _humble, unassuming, unpretentious, meek_,
etc. Then ask students, “What are some antonyms, words and phrases, that
have the opposite meaning of _modest_ ?” Prompt students to provide words
like _conceited, showy, self-important, proud_, etc.

**Primary Focus:** With assistance, students will write a final draft of an opinion

paragraph. ~~**TEKS 3.7.B; TEKS 3.11.C; TEKS 3.11.D; TEKS 3.11.E; TEKS 3.12.C; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


~~**WRITING AN OPINION PARAGRAPH: EDIT/FINAL COPY (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Display the plan and drafts created in previous lessons.


  - Remind students that they have completed the plan and draft steps of the
writing process together and that today they are going to complete the edit step.


  - Tell students this is also the time to decide on a final title.


  - Tell students they are going to use an Editing Checklist to help them to know
if any further corrections are needed. Explain that writers often edit their
drafts many, many times before they are able to call their final manuscript
writing “finished.” Remind students that editing is somewhat different
from revising: Revising is often making changes to the content and/or
order of content, whereas editing is often making corrections to grammar,
punctuation, and spelling.


  - Direct students to Activity Page 13.3 and review together.

  - Have students refer to the most recent draft and discuss any necessary Activity Pages
edits to grammar, punctuation, and spelling. As you make corrections to the 13.3 and 13.5
draft and check off the items on the checklist, you may wish to model basic
proofreading marks for students.


  - Direct students to write a final copy using Activity Page 13.4.


  - Tell students that after editing and deciding on a title, you will create a final copy.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~ Activity Page 13.4


  - Tell students they will complete the publishing step in the next lesson. Explain

that this means they are going to create a presentation of the final copy,
possibly together with illustrations and/or other graphic aids, to display and
share with others. Encourage students to be thinking of any illustrations they
would like to include with this opinion paragraph during the publishing step.


  - Direct students to Activity Page 13.5 and discuss together.

“In that direction,” said the Cat, waving his right
paw, “lives a Mad Hatter. In that direction lives a March
Hare. Visit either of them if you like: they’re both mad.”


“But I don’t want to visit with mad people,” Alice
remarked.


“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat. “We’re all
mad here.”


Then, the Cat vanished slowly, beginning at the end
of his tail and ending with his grin, which remained

She walked a bit and came to a house with a table
set up in front. The March Hare and the Mad Hatter
were having tea. A Dormouse was sitting between
them. The table was large but the three of them were all
crowded together at one corner of it.


“No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw
Alice coming.


“There’s plenty of room!” said Alice indignantly. She
sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table.


“Have some lemonade,” said the March Hare.


Alice looked all around the table.


“I don’t see any lemonade,” she remarked.


“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.


“Then, it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said
Alice angrily.



“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being
invited,” said the March Hare.

The Mad Hatter looked at Alice for some time. At
last, he said, “Why is a raven like a writing desk?”


“A riddle!” thought Alice. “We shall have some fun
now!”


“I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.


“Do you mean that you think you know the answer
to it?” asked the March Hare.


“Exactly so,” said Alice.


“Then, you should say what you mean,” the March
Hare went on.


“I do,” Alice replied. “At least, I mean what I say—
that’s the same thing, you know.”


“Not the same thing at all!” said the Mad Hatter.
“Why, you might as well say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the
same thing as ‘I eat what I see!’”



“You might as well say,” added the Dormouse,
which seemed to be walking and talking in its sleep,
“that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing as ‘I
sleep when I breathe!’”

“It is the same thing with you,” said the Mad Hatter.
Then, he turned to Alice again and asked, “Have you
guessed the riddle yet?”


“No, I give up,” Alice replied. “What’s the answer?”


“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Mad Hatter.


“Nor I,” said the March Hare.


“Well,” thought Alice, “this is the strangest tea party
I ever was at in all my life!”


Alice stayed for a while longer and listened to the
Dormouse tell a story about three sisters who lived
at the bottom of a treacle well. The story was very
odd indeed. Alice, confused by the tale, frequently
questioned the Dormouse. At last, a frustrated Alice
walked off.


“It’s the strangest tea party I ever was at in all my
life!” Alice concluded.

~~**WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


Use the questions below to promote a discussion.
**Literal.** Describe the tea party that Alice came upon.

» There was a Hatter, a March Hare, and a Dormouse at a large

table. They said many odd and confusing things as Alice tried to

understand what was happening. Alice became very frustrated

and finally left.

**Literal.** What was odd about the Dormouse?

» He seemed to walk and talk in his sleep.

**Inferential.** What adjectives would you use to describe Alice as she took
part in the tea party?

» Answers may vary, but could include confused, puzzled, wary of

“mad” people, intrigued, and frustrated.

Foundational Skills 30M


**Primary Focus:** Students will review r-controlled vowels. ~~**[[TEKS 3.2.A.ii; TEKS 3.2.D]](https://3.2.A.ii)**~~


~~**R-CONTROLLED VOWELS REVIEW (30 MIN.)**~~ ~~**[TEKS 3.2.A.ii](https://3.2.A.ii)**~~


  - Explain to students that by itself, the letter ‘r’ is a spelling for a consonant
sound, but the sound /r/ can mix with certain vowel sounds to create unique
vowel sounds, like /or/.


  - Write ‘or’ on the board and ask students, “If you saw this spelling in a word,
what sound would you say?”


» Students should respond with the sound /or/.


  - Show the Spelling Card ‘or’> /or/ ( _for_ ). Discuss the power bar. Point out that
the power bar is large but does not stretch all the way across the card. This
means there are some other spellings for this sound that students will study
later in the year.


  - Have students turn to the **Individual Code Chart page 4** . Explain to students
that by itself, the letter ‘r’ is a spelling for a consonant sound, but the sound /r/
can mix with certain vowel sounds to create another unique vowel sound, /ar/.


**[TEKS 3.2.A.ii](https://3.2.A.ii)** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by: decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables, open
syllables, VCe syllables, vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs, r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables;

  - Write ‘ar’ on the board and ask students, “If you saw this spelling in a word,
what sound would you say?”


» Students should respond with the sound /ar/.


  - Show the Spelling Card ‘ar’> /ar/ ( _car_ ). Point out that the ‘ar’ > /ar/ ( _car_ )
Spelling Card has a very long power bar; ‘ar’ is, in fact, the only major spelling
for /ar/. This sound is one of only two vowel sounds that are almost always
spelled with the basic code spellings. (The only other vowel sound that
almost always is spelled with the basic code spelling is /a/.) Tell students to
stay on **Individual Code Chart page 4.** Project DP.U1.L14.1 on the board.
Underline ‘or’ and ‘ar’ in each word, which will help students see that the
spelling occurs in different places in different words. Have students read the
words aloud.


**DP.U1.L14.1**


1. order 11. barbecue


2. boring 12. particle


3. oral 13. cigar


4. orange 14. depart


5. orphan 15. radar


6. transform 16. partly


7. short 17. scarlet


8. forget 18. starfish


9. story 19. garlic


10. carnival


  - Prompt students to use a word from the list in a sentence with a partner.


  - Next, tell students that they will first begin by reviewing the basic code
spelling ‘er’ for /er/. Remind students that by itself, the letter ‘r’ is a spelling
for a consonant sound, but the sound /r/ can mix with certain vowel sounds
to create unique vowel sounds, like /er/. We know /er/ is a vowel sound since
adding it to a word adds a syllable: _steep > steeper._


  - Project DP.U1.L14.2 on the board. Explain that the /er/ sound can be spelled
by any of these letter combinations. Ask students to share at least eight to 10
words that contain the /er/ sound.

**Note:** On the following page are examples of words students may provide.

Each column represents the major spellings that were taught in Grade 2.

  - Have students turn to the **Individual Code Chart page 4.** Tell students to
look at the Individual Code Chart. Ask students which of the three spellings,
‘er’, ‘ir’, or ‘ur’, has the longest power bar. (‘er’) Explain that ‘er’ is used as a
spelling for /er/ in more words than ‘ur’ and ‘ir’. As a class, read the word list
and underline the letters that make the /er/ sound. Have students turn and
talk to a partner using a word in a sentence.


  - Direct students to Activity Page 14.2. Complete the first few items together
as a class, and then give students time to complete the worksheet
independently.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all Activity Page 14.2
assignments in this unit. ~~**[TEKS 3.2.D]**~~


**Note:** Distribute the decodable passage, “Summary of ‘The Open Road,
Part II,’” that you prepared in advance to practice decoding words with
r-controlled vowels. Students can read the decodable passage independently
or in small groups.

  - On the board, write the following words: characters, setting, and plot.


  - Ask various students to define each of the key words.


» Characters are the people, animals or creatures in the story. The setting is the

place and time in which a story takes place. The plot is all the events in a story

(beginning, middle, and end).


  - Explain to students that by identifying the key elements of a story
(characters, setting, and plot) you begin to see how characters change, how
one event influences another, and can more easily compare and contrast
stories about the same or similar characters.


  - Ask students to return to the Table of Contents and to point to and read the
title of Chapter 8, “The Open Road, Part I,” reminding students that the title
provides an idea of what the story is about.


  - Note for students that in Lesson 3 students listened to the original
“The Open Road” chapter from the book The Wind in the Willows. Explain
that the original chapter was rewritten and appears in the Classic Tales
Reader. Note for students that this story is told in four chapters and that the
chapters are numbered I, II, III, and IV.


  - Ask students to locate the chapter and then turn to the first page
of the chapter.


**TEKS 3.8.B** Explain the relationships among the major and minor characters; **TEKS 3.8.C** Analyze plot elements, including
the sequence of events, the conflict, and the resolution; **TEKS 3.8.D** Explain the influence of the setting on the plot.

Rounding a bend in the river, they came in sight of
a handsome, dignified old house. It was faded red brick,
with well-kept lawns reaching down to the water’s edge.


“There’s Toad Hall,” said Rat. “See that creek on the
left? That leads to Toad’s boathouse. That’s where we’ll
leave the boat. The stables are over there. That’s the
banquet hall you’re looking at now—very old, that is.
Toad is rather rich, you know. This is really one of the
nicest houses around, though we never admit as much
to Toad.”


They glided up the creek and passed into the
shadow of a large boathouse. There they saw many large
boats. Some were slung from the cross beams. Some
were hauled up on a slip. But none of them were in the
water. The place seemed deserted.



Rat looked around him. “I see how it is,” he said.
“Boating is old news. Toad is tired of it and done with it.
I wonder what new fad he has taken up now. Come along
and let’s go see. We shall hear all about it soon enough.”



_Rat and Mole arrived at Toad Hall._

They stepped out of the boat and walked across the
flower-decked lawn. They found Toad resting in a wicker
garden chair. He had a large map spread out on his
knees.


“Hooray!” he cried, jumping up upon seeing them.
“This is splendid!” He shook the paws of both of them
warmly, never waiting for an introduction to Mole.
“How kind of you!” he went on, dancing round them.
“I was just going to send a boat down the river for you,
Ratty, with strict orders that you were to come here at
once, whatever you were doing. You don’t know how
lucky it is, your turning up just now!”


“What a delightful house you have!” said Mole.


“Finest house on the whole river,” cried Toad
proudly. “Or anywhere else, for that matter,” he could
not help adding.

Toad led the way to the stable yard. Rat followed,
with a most unhappy look on his face. There, for all to
see was a travel wagon, shining with newness. It was
painted yellow and green.


“There you are!” cried Toad. “There’s real life for
you in that travel wagon. The open road! The dusty
highway! Camps, villages, towns, cities! Here today, up
and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel, new places
to see, fun! The whole world before you! A horizon
that’s always changing! Mind you: this is the very finest
wagon of its sort that was ever made. Come and look at
the inside. Planned all of it myself, I did!’


Mole followed Toad eagerly up the steps and into
the wagon. Rat did not move. He only snorted and put
his hands deep into his pockets.

The wagon had little sleeping bunks and a table
that folded up against the wall. It had a cooking stove,
lockers, and bookshelves. It had a birdcage with a bird
in it. It had pots, pans, jugs, and kettles of every size.


“All complete!” said Toad happily. “You’ll find that
nothing whatever has been forgotten, when we make
our start this afternoon.”


“I beg your pardon,” said Rat. “But did I hear you
say something about ‘WE’, and ‘STARTING’ and
‘THIS AFTERNOON’?”


“Yes, yes!” begged Toad. “You’ve GOT to come. I can’t
possibly go without you. So please don’t argue—it’s the
one thing I can’t stand. You surely don’t mean to stick to
your dull, old river all your life and just live in a hole in a
bank and go boating? I want to show you the world!”



“I don’t care,” said Rat, doggedly. “I’m not coming
and that’s that. I am going to stick to my old river
and live in a hole and go boating, as I’ve always done.
What’s more, Mole’s going to stick with me and do as I
do. Aren’t you, Mole?”

“Of course I am,” said Mole, loyally.


“I’ll always stick with you, Rat. What you say has
got to be. All the same, it sounds as if it might have
been, well, rather fun, you know!” he added, wistfully.


Poor Mole! The Life Adventurous was a new thing to
him and so thrilling. It was all so tempting. He had fallen
in love at first sight with the yellow-colored wagon.


Rat saw what was passing in Mole’s mind and began
to change his mind. He hated disappointing people and
he very much liked Mole.


Toad was watching both of them closely.


“Come in and have some lunch,” he said. “We’ll talk
it over. We don’t need to decide anything in a hurry. Of
course, I don’t really care. I only want you fellows to
have fun. Live for others! That’s my motto in life.”

But lucky for Alice, she was removed from the game
by none other than the Queen who was eager for Alice to
meet the Mock Turtle. On their way to meet the Mock
Turtle, Alice was introduced to the Gryphon. What are a
Mock Turtle and a Gryphon? Alice did not know either;
nor did she ever get an answer that made sense. The
best answer is that they are two more examples of the
extraordinary inhabitants of Wonderland.


Together the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told
the Queen and Alice stories of their school days.
They recalled the subjects they had studied in school,
including Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition, not to
mention ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was quite
certain that she had not yet studied these subjects.

reading, writing, and arithmetic, also known as the “Three R’s.” These three

subjects sound like the words _reeling, writhing,_ and _ambition_ . The subject named

“Mystery” rhymes with a common subject in school called history.

This odd conversation was stopped by the news that
an important trial had begun. Alice raced off with the
Gryphon to discover that the Knave of Hearts was on
trial for stealing some tarts.


Just like the game of croquet, the trial itself was a
confusing mess. The witnesses were not at all helpful.
Quite strangely, Alice herself was called as a witness.
When the Queen said that the sentence should be
announced before the jury had decided upon their
verdict, Alice was ready to scream. In fact, she did.


“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of
having the sentence first!”


“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.


“I won’t!” said Alice.


“Off with her head!” yelled the Queen.

Again, lucky for Alice, just at that moment she woke
up on the river bank beside her sister. The sun was still
shining and it was indeed a beautiful day. Alice eagerly
told her sister all about her dream and her adventures in
Wonderland. Alice’s sister was quite entertained by the
stories of Wonderland and the way in which Alice told
them. Alice’s eyes twinkled and shone as she told her
sister about the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad
Hatter, the March Hare, the King and Queen of Hearts,
not to mention the White Rabbit.


As Alice skipped away to enjoy some afternoon tea,
her sister imagined this magical world full of curious
creatures. Alice’s sister hoped that Alice would always
remember the day that she dreamed of Wonderland and
continue to tell the stories.

They were strolling along the highway when they
saw a small cloud of dust. It seemed to be coming at
them fast. From out the dust they heard a faint “toottoot!” that sounded like an animal in pain. They turned
to continue talking. But in an instant, everything
changed. With a blast of wind and a whirl of sound that
made them jump for the nearest ditch, it was on them!


The horn of the motor car rang out, “TOOTTOOT!” They had a quick look at an interior of
glittering glass and leather. Then, the magnificent
motor car flung a cloud of dust that blinded them and
dwindled to a speck in the distance.


The old grey horse and the wagon lurched forward.
Then, there was an awful crash. The yellow-colored
wagon, their beautiful wagon, fell over onto its side in
the ditch.


Rat danced up and down in the road.


“You villains!” he shouted, shaking both fists. “You
scoundrels! You, you, road hogs! I’ll call the police on
you! I’ll report you!” _“TOOT-TOOT!” the horn rang out._

“There is nothing to be done,” said Rat. “He is
mad. He has got a new craze. It is always like this,
in the first stage. He’ll go on like that for days now,
walking in a happy dream, not able to do anything
useful. Never mind him. Let’s go and see what can be
done about the wagon.”


They inspected the wagon and found that it would
no longer travel. One wheel had been broken into bits.


“Come on!” said the Rat. “We’ll have to walk. It’s
five or six miles to the nearest town. The sooner we get
started the better.”


“But what about Toad?” asked Mole. “We can’t
leave him here, sitting in the middle of the road by
himself! It’s not safe. What if another . . . thing . . . were

They had not gone very far, however, when there
were footsteps behind them. Toad caught up with them
and put a paw inside the elbow of each of them.


“Now, look here Toad!” said Rat sharply. “As soon
as we get to the town, you’ll have to go straight to the
police station. You must see if they know anything
about that motor car. You must find out who it belongs
to. You must complain because your wagon is broken.
Then, you’ll have to go to a blacksmith so he can fix the
wagon. Meanwhile, Mole and I will find rooms where
we can stay until the wagon is ready.”


“Police station? Complain?” murmured Toad
dreamily. “Why on earth would I complain about
that beautiful motor car? I am done with wagons
forever. I never want to see the wagon again or hear
of it. O, Ratty!”

    - Rat and Mole


    - Mole and Toad


    - Toad and Rat


    - riverbank life in the United Kingdom and riverbank life in Texas


  - If time permits, allow students to share their diagrams with the class and ask
each other questions.

~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


**Understanding How Phonics Is Taught**


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 2. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds (or
phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the **Basic Code** for each of the 44 phonemes. The Basic Code spelling
for a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Basic Code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/, ‘b’

 - /b/, ‘m’ > /m/. Basic Code spellings may also include digraphs or two letters to represent a sound,
such as ‘ee’ > /ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, ‘th’ > /th/. Other Basic Code spellings include
separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, ‘o_e’ > /oe/. The chart on the next page lists the Basic
Code as taught in this program.


In a **Basic Code lesson**, students first learn to listen for and isolate a single sound and are then
taught the spelling for that sound. Typically in this type of lesson, the teacher introduces the sound
and conducts various oral language activities with the students to be certain that they can identify
the sound orally. The teacher then presents the spelling for that sound and models writing the
spelling, as well as sounding out simple one syllable words that use the spelling. Additional reading
and writing practice opportunities for students then follow.

Teacher Resources
**385**


**386**



The **Advanced Code** consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’> /s/, ‘c’ > /s/
‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively frequently in the
English language, while others are quite rare.


As each spelling alternative is taught in this program, the frequency with which students may expect
the spelling to occur is communicated in several ways. A “power bar” on cards used to teach the
spellings indicates how frequent or infrequent a spelling is. A long power bar indicates the spelling
occurs frequently, while a short bar designates a rarer spelling.


The long power bar on the card below indicates that the ‘a’ spelling is used frequently to spell /a/,
the short vowel sound:


The short power bar on this card signals that the ‘eigh’ spelling is used infrequently to spell /ae/.


The relative frequency of spellings for any given sound is also communicated in the student’s
Individual Code Chart, a copy of which is included at the end of this section. In this chart, the
spellings for a sound are arranged in order from most to least frequent.


Students are introduced to and practice the **Advanced Code** in two types of lessons, **Spelling**
**Alternative Lessons** and **Tricky Spelling Lessons** . In a **Spelling Alternative Lesson**, the teacher
first reviews the Basic Code spelling that students have already learned for a particular sound. New
words with different spellings for the same sound are then introduced. Students are then often


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


asked to conduct word sorts as a way to reinforce the fact that the same sound may be
spelled multiple ways. In Grades 1 and 2, teachers are also encouraged to display Spelling
Trees in the classroom as yet another way to reinforce spelling alternatives. A given sound
is listed on the tree trunk, with various branches standing for different spellings. Leaves
with words exemplifying a spelling are placed on the appropriate branches.


_The fact that there are so many spelling alternatives in the English language pres-_
_ents a challenge for students when they are asked to write (and spell) a word._











**Tricky Spelling Lessons** are used to explicitly call students’ attention to a spelling that
can be pronounced and read more than one way. For example, ‘a’ can be pronounced as /a/
( _cat_ ), /ae/ ( _paper_ ), /o/ ( _father_ ) or / / ( _about_ ). It may be helpful to think of a tricky spelling

as an instance in which several sounds “vie” for the student to pronounce and read the
spelling a different way:





_Tricky spellings present a challenge when students are asked to read unfamiliar_
_words since it is possible to sound out and pronounce a tricky spelling multiple_
_ways._


In a **Tricky Spelling Lesson**, the teacher calls explicit attention to many examples of
words in which the same spelling is pronounced different ways. Students are taught to try
each pronunciation that they have learned for a spelling until they recognize a particular
pronunciation as a familiar word that makes sense in the context.

~~**USING CHUNKING TO DECODE MULTISYLLABLE WORDS**~~


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught in this program will enable students to
read one syllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences
is no guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To
this end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and
read parts of words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, we insert a small dot as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., sun·set). This is done in both the workbooks and
readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then be
sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are expected to
begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two syllable compound words (e.g., cat·fish, cup·cake, pea·nut, drive·way). For
compound words, we place the dot between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle two-syllable
words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., yawn·ing, hunt·er, kick·ed). We typically
place the dot immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter spellings for
consonants, in this program, we typically place the divider after the double-letter spelling rather than
between the two consonants (e.g., batt·ed, bigg·er, bunn·y). Teachers familiar with other ways to chunk or
divide syllables may initially find this odd. We do this, however, because the double-letter spellings have
been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten (‘nn’ >/n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’> /t/, etc.) and we wish
to be consistent in representing these spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process
them, e.g., as whole entities for a sound. (Ultimately as students become more proficient at decoding
and chunking syllables through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually
chunk and decode these words as batt· ed or bat · ted.) Most students find chunking and decoding these
two-syllable words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.
To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


Note: Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.







_**Closed Syllables (CVC,VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound, e.g.,**_

_**/a/, /e/, /i/,/ /o/, /u/:**_ _let, pad, rod, tin, fun, pic·nic, un·til_



**394**




- _**Magic E Syllables (V-C – E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound, e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**_

_**/oe/, /ue/:**_ _cake, home, like, mule, Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


  - _**Vowel Digraph Syllables**_ _joint, speak, proud, play, dis·may, be·low, coun·sel_


  - _**R-Controlled Syllables**_ _art, curb, girl, fort, clerk, tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


  - _**Open Syllables (V or CV) – always associated with a “long” vowel sound, e.g. /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**_

_**/oe/, /ue/:**_ _go, me, hi, a·pron, fi·nal, com·pre·hend_


  - _**Consonant-LE Syllables (C-LE):**_ _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, we think it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


  - _**Schwa Syllables**_ _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant-LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but we distinguish it separately because of

the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** What is necessary, however, for your students
to become fluent readers of longer words in increasingly complex text is that they be able to
visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode
each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one syllable words in kindergarten.


We divide two closed syllables in a word as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, we divide the syllables between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, we typically place the divider after the
double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, we do this because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten (‘nn’ >/n/, ‘mm’ >
/m/, ‘tt’> /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, we divide so the first consonant
goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


Teacher Resources
**395**


**396**



When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


_magnet_


_mag_


_net_


_magnet_


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the
magic-E syllable, vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


 - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


 - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, we suggest first dividing the word in front of
the consonant and sounding it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


_unit_


_u_


_nit_


Unit 1 Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is no
definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible and try
dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine whether
they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize whether a word
is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has heard before, i.e., the
word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary. Obviously, this will represent an additional challenge for
students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a second language.


  - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


_lemon_


_lem_


_on_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to consonant – _le_ syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.


  - When a word ends in consonant -le, we divide in front of the consonant, creating a first syllable that
may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings in the words


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


_simple_


_sim_


_ple_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of
stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly
stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call
a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’
and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


Teacher Resources
**397**


**398**




 - We divide syllables with a schwa sound in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the schwa
sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the consonant – _le_ syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but we identify it separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, throughout the
entire year of Grade 3 instruction, they study prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater
depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten – Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.

**Unit 1 | Lesson 1**
**Summary of “The River Bank, Part 1”**





_The Wind in the Willows_ follows the adventures of many

animals who live in the English countryside. The animals in the

story act like people.


The chapter “The River Bank” begins with Mole doing his

spring cleaning. He has swept and dusted. But when he is

mixing some paint, he smells a hint of the fresh spring air

outside. He drops his brush and runs up the tunnel. The world

outside his den is all warm grass and yellow sunlight.


He happily jumps and skips across the grass until he comes

to a hedge. He walks until he comes to a river that is full to the

brim with rushing water. He sits down to rest as he watches

and listens to the river. Soon, a water rat comes out of a hole

on the river bank. Rat says hello to Mole and asks if Mole

would like to go for a boat ride. Mole has never been in a boat

before and can’t wait to hop in.


Mole has such a good time that Rat invites him to stay on the

boat all day. He packs a picnic basket, and they float down

the river. Mole relaxes and drags a paw in the cool water as

they go. After a while, Mole asks Rat about the places they are

passing by. Rat tells him about the Wild Wood, where many

other creatures live but where they must always be careful.

Mole asks what is past the Wild Wood. Rat doesn’t seem to

want to talk about it. He tells Mole that no one with any sense

goes into the Wide World! Then they stop in a backwater to

have their lunch.

**Summary of “The Open Road”**





“The Open Road” begins with Mole and Rat on the river bank.

Mole says that he would like to meet Mr. Toad. Rat agrees to

take Mole for a visit. They row a boat up the river.


Mr. Toad’s house is old and quite nice. Rat says that Mr. Toad is

rich. To their surprise, Mr. Toad is waiting for Rat on the porch.

He hopes Rat will help him with something. He shows them

a brand-new covered wagon painted bright yellow and green.

The inside is complete with bunks for sleeping, a tiny living

space, and a kitchen.


Toad announces that everything is ready for them to leave that

very afternoon. Mole is excited, but Rat is not so sure. Toad

talks to them over lunch. Rat agrees to take the trip. He is full

of praise for “the open road.” They harness Toad’s gray horse

and set off through the countryside.


They sleep in the bunks. In the morning, Mr. Toad sleeps late.

Rat and Mole must do all the work of finding and making

breakfast. On the second morning, they make Mr. Toad join in

doing the chores. He complains.


Later that day, they plod along the narrow lane and disaster

strikes. From behind comes the strange noise “pup-pup!”

and a white cloud of dust. A motorcar races up the lane. It

passes them so quickly that the caravan goes off the road and

crashes. Rat and Mole try to restore it so they can drive home,

but Mr. Toad does not help. He no longer cares. He has seen

what he wants: a motorcar.

**Summary of “Mr. Badger”**





At the beginning of “Mr. Badger,” it is the middle of a cold,

snowy night. Rat and Mole have lost their way and are waiting

outside Badger’s house. Mole is hurt, with a cut on his shin.


When Badger opens his door, they tumble inside. The house

is a set of underground tunnels, and Badger is a very capable

host. With a candle, he leads them to his kitchen. It is warm

and cozy. They hear the crackle of a fire and see a comfortable

place to settle. Badger gives them food and helps Mole tend to

his shin. Later, he offers them two little beds to sleep in.


In the morning, the weather is worse. In Badger’s kitchen they

find a couple young hedgehogs who have lost their way. They

all sit at the table for breakfast. Badger has already eaten and

has settled into his armchair for a nap. Later, Otter rings the

doorbell and asks for Rat and Mole. They have been gone a

long time, and their friends are worried about them.


Badger gives them a tour of his home. It is not simple at all!

Instead, it is a huge tangle of tunnels and rooms. He explains

that it was built by people who left long ago. As the daylight

begins to dwindle, they shuffle along the passages to a

shortcut home, with a jumble of vines and plants hiding the

door.

**Summary of “The Further Adventures**
**of Toad, Part II”**





“The Further Adventures of Toad, Part II” begins with Toad in

disguise, riding a horse he stole. He is tired and hungry, and he

has no money. Soon, he meets a traveler with a covered wagon

cooking stew over a fire. The traveler offers to buy the horse.

Toad bargains for a higher price that includes a very good

breakfast.


Toad starts to walk with some change in his pocket and a big

meal in his belly. He shows his pride by singing a song about

how clever he is. Then a fancy motorcar comes along. Toad

decides to ask for a ride but then remembers the car. It is the

one he stole! He is sure he will be caught, and he plunges to

the ground.


Luckily, the drivers do not know it is Toad because he is still in

disguise. They gently lift him into the car. Soon, Toad regains

his energy. He convinces them to let him drive. Thinking

himself quite the genius, he jumps behind the wheel. He

begins by driving carefully. Then he goes faster and faster. He

reveals that he is Toad. They try to grab him, he crashes the

car, and everyone goes flying.


Angry with himself, Toad runs away. Then he sees that the

gentlemen from the car are chasing him. With them are two

policemen. It looks like he can’t get away. All of a sudden, he is

splashing and gasping. He has fallen into the river!

riverbank. Rat quickly pulls him inside the hole.


Rat tells Toad to change out of his stolen clothes while Rat

makes lunch. After washing up, Toad tells Rat about everything

he has done. He quietly admits that he was wrong to steal the

motorcar. Toad wants to go home. He doesn’t yet know that

he can’t return. Over lunch, Rat tells Toad that some of the

animals from the Wild Wood have wrongfully taken over Toad

Hall.


Outraged, Toad storms off to his home. He marches up to the

gate. There, he quarrels with a ferret. Feeling upset, Toad runs

back to Rat’s house. But he isn’t ready to give up. He makes

a request to borrow Rat’s boat and goes quietly up the river.

Two stoats drop a huge stone from a bridge onto the boat. The

boat sinks.


Toad returns to Rat, who is upset at the loss of his boat.

Toad says he will quit making decisions without his friends’

approval. Rat suggests that they wait for Mole and Badger,

who might know what to do to get the house back. Soon,

Badger knocks at the door.

reclaim Toad Hall. Toad cannot stop showing off. He has not

learned his lesson about bragging.


Badger hushes everyone and tells Toad that he should be

ashamed. Toad sobs into the sofa cushions. He aches for

home and feels hopeless. But Badger tells them about a secret

passage into Toad Hall. Together, they make a plan.


The next night, the weasels are having a birthday party in

Toad Hall. The four friends creep in along the secret passage.

Soon, they are below the party. They hear cheering, speeches,

and chatter. They push open the trap door and surprise the

weasels. They march into the room. They swing and thump

sticks. It seems like there are more than four of them. The four

heroes are like fighting machines! The weasels screech and

rush away, turning over tables and chairs. Toad can reclaim his

ownership of Toad Hall in triumph.


Toad thinks he should be praised for the victory. But his

friends remind him of the problems his bragging has caused

before. He thinks about it and takes on a new philosophy.

He tries to change. As time goes on, Toad becomes more

|ELPS 3.A|<br> <br> <br>practice producing sounds of newly acquired<br>vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent<br>letters, and consonant clusters to pronounce English<br>words in a manner that is increasingly comprehensible||
|ELPS 3.B|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by<br>learning and using high-frequency English words<br>necessary for identifying and describing people,<br>places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and<br>basic information represented or supported by<br>pictures, and by learning and using routine language<br>needed for classroom communication|p. 137|
|ELPS 3.C|<br> <br> <br>speak using a variety of grammatical structures,<br>sentence lengths, sentence types, and connecting<br>words with increasing accuracy and ease as more<br>English is acquired||
|ELPS 3.D|<br> <br>speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in<br>context to internalize new English words and build<br>academic language proficiency||
|ELPS 3.E|share information in cooperative learning interactions||
|ELPS 3.F|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>ask and give information ranging from using a very<br>limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete<br>vocabulary, including key words and expressions<br>needed for basic communication in academic and<br>social contexts, to using abstract and content-based<br>vocabulary during extended speaking assignments||
