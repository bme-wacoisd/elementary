**Grade 3 Unit 2|**
##### Introduction


~~SCALES, FEATHERS, AND FUR: ANIMAL CLASSIFICATION~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the Animal Classification
unit. This unit contains 15 daily lessons, plus two Pausing Point days that may be used for
differentiated instruction. Each lesson will require a total of 120 minutes. Lesson 15 contains the
Unit Assessment.


As noted, two days are intended to be used as Pausing Point days. These Pausing Points are
embedded into the instruction at appropriate points, with the first one after Lesson 7 and the
second after Lesson 14. You may choose to continue to the next lesson and schedule the first
Pausing Point for another day in the unit sequence. Pausing Points can be used to focus on content
understanding, writing, spelling, grammar, morphology skills, or fluency.


~~FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS~~


**Reading**


The Reader for Unit 2 is entitled _Rattenborough’s Guide to Animals_ . Although it is a nonfiction
reader, Rattenborough, a fictional character, is the narrator that guides students through the factual
information to make the text more accessible to students. Students who received instruction from
this program in Grade 1 will likely remember Rattenborough as the narrator for the _Animals and_
_Habitats_ unit.


This Reader consists of selections that explain how scientists classify animals. Students will learn
about the characteristics of living things and how scientists classify living things using these
characteristics. Students will take home text copies of the chapters in the Reader throughout the
unit. Encouraging students to read a text directly related to this unit-based unit will provide content
and vocabulary reinforcement, along with fluency practice.


Introduction Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification
**1**


**2**



**Spelling**


During the spelling portion of the lessons, students will review adding suffixes such as _–ed, –ing,_
and _–es_, as well as whether to double the final consonant when adding the suffixes. Challenge Words
will be added to each spelling list. Students will review alphabetizing to the second and third letter
in preparation for learning dictionary skills. Students will complete dictation activities for spelling
practice and writing in cursive. Dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.


**Grammar**


In grammar, students will review nouns, verbs, adjectives, subjects, predicates, fragments, and
run-on sentences. Students will also be introduced to abstract nouns and discover the difference
between concrete and abstract nouns in sentences. Students will write compound sentences by
adding subjects and predicates to simple sentences.


**Morphology**


During the morphology portion of the lessons, students will learn the prefixes _un–, non–, re–,_ and
_pre–._ Students will discuss how adding prefixes changes the meaning of root words and how the
parts of speech of words may change. Students will have opportunities to apply their knowledge of
these words during oral and workbook activities.


~~WHY ANIMAL CLASSIFICATION IS IMPORTANT~~


This unit introduces students to the science of classification. Students will learn about five groups
of vertebrates, why scientists classify animals into groups, and the characteristics by which they
make these determinations. The ability to classify information is an essential skill of organizing,
analyzing, and understanding data. Students will develop scientific skills as they observe and
practice identifying important characteristics of organisms and objects.


In this unit, students will be asked to engage in structured inquiry discussions and exercises.
During these activities, students will be asked to respond based on their observations and thinking.
By asking questions such as “How do you know?” and “Why do you think so?” the teacher will
guide students in making reasonable statements based on what students already know and the
evidence they can observe. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures
used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher
Resources.


The content students learn in this unit will serve as the basis for more in-depth study in the later
grades of how living things are classified, the life cycles of animals, oceans, and marine life.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for students
to build content knowledge and draw connections to science and social studies. You may build on
class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of
Social Studies Skills from the Social Studies TEKS and Organisms and Environments, Scientific and
Engineering Practices, and Recurring Themes and Concepts from the Science TEKS. This content is
not a replacement for grade level science and social studies instruction.


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in this program in Grades K–2 will already have pertinent
background knowledge for this unit. For students who have not received prior instruction in this
program, introductory knowledge is addressed at the beginning of each unit.


Farms: From the Ground Up (Kindergarten)


Animals and Habitats: The World We Share (Grade 1)


Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops (Grade 2)


Insects: All Around (Grade 2)

~~WRITING~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students have many opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for different purposes. The
formal writing piece for the Animal Classification unit is a short, informational writing piece that
focuses on organizing and communicating characteristics and classification of one specific
vertebrate. Students learn to introduce a topic, group related information together, and provide
supporting ideas, facts, and details. The project can be done with or without the use of technology,
but having students use computers to research, write, and publish their projects is highly
recommended. Ensure that all research is monitored throughout the entirety of the project.


Everyday writing opportunities come in many forms, including short and extended responses
requiring evidence from the text. Students will also use graphic organizers to gather and categorize
information from reading or from the Read-Aloud, or to plan for writing. Many lessons provide
opportunities for students to collaborate, share ideas, and give feedback on their writing.


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving
appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete
activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~PERFORMANCE TASKS AND ASSESSMENTS~~


The Primary Focus objectives in each lesson are carefully structured and sequenced throughout the
unit to help build student understanding. Additionally, formative assessments are provided to help
keep track of their progress toward objectives and standards. These can be found in the Student
Activity Book and are referenced in every lesson.


While some units in Grade 3 have extended Performance Task assessments, Animal Classification
has a Unit Assessment covering the content of the unit, reading objectives taught throughout the
unit, and grammar and morphology assessments.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


~~FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component was created to accompany the program materials for Grade 3. It consists of selections
from a variety of genres, including poetry, folklore, and fables. These selections provide additional
opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). For more
information on implementation, please consult the supplement.

**14**




 - Explain to students that during the lesson they will focus on defining
and identifying organizational text features. Text features are parts of
the text that stand out, or are different from the rest of the text and
information. Many authors use text features to highlight or call attention to
important information, such as titles, headings, captions, table of contents and
sidebars. Text features make texts visually appealing and provide clues and
information for readers.


 - Tell students that readers can use these text features to make, confirm and
correct predictions about text by doing a quick skim of all of the features prior
to reading.


 - Pass out a few sticky notes to each student and have them start at the
beginning of the text and in order have them make a prediction about the
text based on the text features they see. Have students place their sticky
note with their prediction near the proper text feature in their Reader. Have
students leave their sticky notes near the text feature, so that after reading
the text, students can confirm or correct their prediction.


~~**PRESENTING THE READING (15 MIN.)**~~


**Table of Contents**

 - Point to the Table of Contents.


 - “Did anyone label this part of their Reader with a sticky note?”


 - Based on the table of contents, what can you predict the text will most
likely discuss?


 - Turn and talk with your partner about your prediction.


 - Explain that the Table of Contents gives the reader an overview of what texts
are in this Reader and where to find each text.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Pages 1–2**

  - Point to the Heading.


  - “Did anyone make a prediction about the text using the heading? After
reading the text, we will correct or confirm your prediction and make note of
that on your sticky note.”


  - Explain that a heading gives the reader information about the key topics in a
text, so using a text feature such as a heading will provide clues about what
the text will be about. This chapter will be about meeting Rattenborough.


  - Point to the photo and caption on **page 2** .


  - “Did anyone make a prediction about the text using the photo and caption
on page 3? What was your prediction? After reading the text, we will confirm
and correct our predictions.”

- Point to the bolded word: habitat.


- “Did anyone make a prediction about the bolded word, _habitat_ ?”


- Explain that bold print words are important words or concepts in the reading.
The author bold prints the words so they are easy to find. Skimming to look
at the bolded words in a text can help the reader make predictions about
what the text will be about.


- Ask students, “Where in the Reader could we find the definition of
_habitat_ quickly?”


» the glossary


- “Did anyone label the glossary with a sticky note?” Have students turn to the
glossary in their Reader and find the word habitat.


- Explain that a glossary is a place where readers can go to find the definition
of unknown words.


- Read aloud the greeting from Rattenborough found in the first paragraph
on **page 1** . Refer to the chart paper from earlier in the lesson with students’
responses to what they remember about Rattenborough.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Pages 3–4**

 - Tell students to read **pages 3–4** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “What animals might you find in the three images on **page 4** ?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask several
students to give one example of either an animal found in a hardwood forest
or a tropical rainforest.


» In a hardwood forest, you might find squirrels, deer, and bears. In a tropical

rainforest, you might find toucans and parrots.

Print Awareness
Pull any students who are
struggling with left-to-right
directionality into a small
group. Model for students
how to track print with your
finger. Using sticky notes,
have students label the
left and right side to orient
themselves from left to
right. Ask students to move
their finger beneath the
words from left to right as
they read.

**Pages 5–6**

 - Point out that _habitat_ is a bolded word on **page 5** .


 - **Think-Pair-Share:** Why is the word _habitat_ bolded?


» Because it is an important word in the text.


 - Direct students’ attention to the two images on **page 6** and ask what is
similar in the characteristics of the two images of habitats.


» Both images include bodies of water. The top image has trees and appears to be a

lake. The bottom image is an ocean.


 - Point out the caption on **page 6** . Ask students if anyone made a prediction
about the text using the bolded words?


 - Ask students to read **pages 5–6** to find out what is different about the
water in the two images of habitats. After reading, ask students about their
predictions and if they had to confirm or correct their thinking.


» The top image is a freshwater habitat, and the bottom image is a saltwater habitat.

My prediction was correct because...My prediction was incorrect because...


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


  - When students have finished reading, have students review their initial
predictions they made using the text features they marked with a sticky note.
Have them confirm or correct their predictions with a partner.


Check for Understanding


Quick Write: In 10 words or less, share one of your predictions and why
you were able to correct or confirm that prediction after reading the text.

**Pages 7–8**

 - Direct students’ attention to the bolded word: _herbivore_ . Have students look
in the glossary for the definition and read it together as a class. Note the
plural form of the word at the end of the definition and remind students that
they will see this form of the word in the chapter as well.


 - Point to the chart on **page 8** .


 - Ask, “Did anyone label this part of their Reader with a sticky note?”


 - Explain that charts are used to summarize information that is in the reader.
It is also used to help compare the information. Graphs will also be used to
summarize and compare information.


 - Direct students’ attention to **page 8** and discuss which animals are
herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores. Note for students that these images
are a way to _classify_ animals by showing which animals would be herbivores,
omnivores, or carnivores.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


  - Ask students to share which category they would put themselves in on the
page. Note that, biologically, all humans are classified as omnivores even
though individual people might choose to eat only plants and are usually
called vegetarians rather than herbivores.


  - Ask students to read **pages 7–8** to themselves to fill in the blank in the
sentence: “When speaking of herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores, we are
_classifying_ animals by  .”


  - When students have finished reading, reread the sentence and have students
fill in the blank.


» what they eat


  - If there is time, ask students to name other ways that animals could be
sorted.


» Answers may vary but could include size, shape, number of legs, how they move,

what is on the outside of their bodies, etc.

  - Tell students that starting with today’s lesson, they will be assigned a list of
spelling words. The day they receive spelling words is considered Day 1. They
will be assessed on the words on Day 5.


  - Explain that the root words this week are verbs to which students will be
adding suffixes.


  - Have students take out Activity Page 1.6 and record the spelling words as
directed. Students will be asked to write the root word plus the forms of
these words when the suffixes – _ed_ and – _ing_ are added. Students will also be
given two Challenge Words, _give_ and _live_ . The Challenge Words, _give_ and _live_,
do not follow the VCe pattern. Students can practice decoding and encoding
these words by writing the words in the air with their finger and segmenting
the words into phonemes to practice pronunciation.

  - As you introduce each of the spelling words, write it on the table in cursive,
pronouncing each word as you write it. Have students take out Activity Page
1.6 and record the spelling work on their paper.


**Note:** The following table already includes the Spelling Words.

|Root Word|–ed|–ing|
|---|---|---|
|Hop|||
|Rub|||
|Ship|||
|Grab|||
|Patch|||
|Plan|||
|Stretch|||
|Finish|||
|Discuss|||
|Submit|||



  - Explain that a root word is what a word is called before any prefixes or
suffixes are added to the word.


  - Point out the vowel sound(s) in each word to students.


  - When you reach the multi-syllable words ( _finish, discuss,_ and _submit_ ), model
for students how to chunk each word into syllables to say and spell the word.
Explain that when there are words with more than one syllable, it can be
helpful to divide a word into syllables if we don’t know how to read or spell it.


~~**ADDING SUFFIXES –ED AND –ING (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that you will now complete the remainder of the table by adding
the suffixes – _ed_ and – _ing_ to each root word in cursive. Use your best cursive
writing.


    - A suffix is a syllable placed after a root word. Suffixes change the meaning
of the root word.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


  - Remind students that each root word is a verb and ask what the suffix – _ed_ on
the end of a verb signals.


» past tense; the action has already happened


  - Ask students what the suffix – _ing_ signals.


» present tense; ongoing action that is still happening


  - Student tips for working with each root word, add the suffixes – _ed_ and – _ing_ .


    - Point out the words that end with CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) and
explain that the final consonant must be doubled before adding – _ed_ or

   - _ing_ . This is the case with _hop, rub, grab, ship, plan,_ and _submit_ .


    - Point out to students that adding – _ed_ and – _ing_ sometimes adds a syllable
to the word.


    - Point out that when words already end with two consonants, the suffixes

   - _ed_ and – _ing_ are simply added. There is no need to double the end
consonants because the consonants are already doubled, as is the case
with the words _discuss, patch, stretch,_ and _finish_ .


    - Point out that the suffix – _ed_ is pronounced /t/ in _hopped, shipped,_
_patched, stretched, finished,_ and _discussed_ . The suffix – _ed_ is pronounced
/d/ in _rubbed, grabbed,_ and _planned_ . In _submitted,_ the suffix – _ed_ is
pronounced /ed/ and adds an additional syllable.


  - Explain that Challenge Words are words that are used very often. They may
not follow spelling patterns and need to be memorized.


  - Write the following sentence in cursive on the board: Some eggs will produce
_live_ tadpoles, which _live_ in the water.


  - Ask students to read this sentence correctly, pronouncing the first _live_ as
/liev/ and the second _live_ as /liv/.


  - Remind students that they will be assessed on these words later in the
lessons. Have them keep Activity Page 1.6 for future spelling practice.


  - Read the first paragraph of the decodable passage, “Rattenborough and
Frieda”, aloud to the class to model fluent reading. Tell students that after they
complete the activity page, they will finish reading the passage on their own.


**• Note:** Distribute the decodable passage, “Rattenborough and Frieda”, that
you prepared in advance to practice decoding words with the suffixes _–ing_,
and _–ed_ . Tell students that in preparation of reading another text about
Rattenborough, they are going to read and spell root words with endings _–ed_
and _–ing_ . As students finish the activity page, repeat these instructions. As
students read, circulate and provide informative feedback as needed.

Rattenborough, animal expert
with animals and Earth


Aha! I’m back. Does anyone

remember me? It’s me,

Rattenborough, animal expert and

world traveler! We’ve explored lots of

environments containing animal habitats together, haven’t we? From

hot savannas to cold arctic regions, we’ve watched hungry carnivores

eat their prey with very sharp teeth while herbivores feast on grasses

nearby. Today I’ve got great fun in store for you! I’m going to present

a slide show! But before I do that, I’d like to tell you a little about how

scientists understand animals.


Think about all of the different types of animals on Earth—

grasshoppers, penguins, rabbits, lions, salmon, turtles, and

salamanders are just a few! What other animals can you name? Wow,

you know lots of animals! How do you tell them apart? How do you

recognize, or identify, them?

One way that we make sense of

our world is by sorting things into

categories, or groups. Look closely at

Taxonomists: From Linnaeus to today


In the mid-1700s, about 250 years

ago, a Swedish man named Carolus

Linnaeus [la- _nee_ -us] became

fascinated by the many different

ways that people all over the world were grouping plants and animals.

Some people grouped them by how they looked, others grouped them

by their habits and still others by where they lived. It was all a great

mumbo-jumbo, so Linnaeus decided to use their ideas to create a

worldwide system to **classify**, or group, plants and animals based on

their shared characteristics. This science of classifying **organisms** is

called **taxonomy** . Using new information and tools, scientists have

continued to study organisms and the ways they are similar and

different. Over time, scientists have learned new information allowing

important updates to be made about how to classify animals.

“Living Things” chart


Scientists currently recognize three

groups of living organisms based on

important parts within their cells.

Scientists generally agree that these



groups of organisms are then divided into **kingdoms**, one of the

top classification categories used to organize living things. Plants

and animals are the two kingdoms that I know the most about, and

today I’m here to talk to you about my favorite one! That’s right—

the animal kingdom!


Taxonomists identify animals by their characteristics, or special

features that set them apart from others. They divide the animal

kingdoms into smaller and smaller groups, with each smaller group

having more and more in common with one another. Each group has

a specific name. For example, you and I not only belong to the same

kingdom—the animal kingdom—but we both belong to the same

phylum [ _fy_ -lum]—the phylum known as _chordata_ —because we share

similar body characteristics.

Most animals in the phylum chordata

are **vertebrates** . A vertebrate has a

backbone. Do you have a backbone?

Yes, you do. And so do I! That is one

of our common characteristics, one of the ways that scientists group

us to show relationships between us. My backbone is smaller than

yours, because I’m much smaller. Look closely at this image to see

the child’s backbone.


divided into smaller groups called _families_ . A family is divided into

smaller groups, each called genus. And a genus is divided into even

smaller groups called species. There are many, many species within

each group!

Invertebrate and Vertebrate Graphic


Now that you know that a vertebrate

is an animal with a backbone, what

do you think an invertebrate is? Yes,

that’s correct! An invertebrate is an

animal with no backbone! A little more than 95 percent of all animals

on Earth are invertebrates. Think about it: more than 95 percent of all


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


the species of animals on Earth are invertebrates—that’s a lot! And

most of them are fairly small.


Fewer than 5 percent of all animal species are vertebrates. That

means that you and I, and all vertebrates, belong to a very small

percentage of all the animals on Earth! Mammals—that includes all

humans—are literally just a speck!

Now that you’ve heard a little about

how taxonomists sort animals into

categories, I’m ready to begin the

slide show of my worldwide travels, and I’m going to teach you all

kinds of amazing things about animals. I met the most wonderful

new animal friends while I traveled the globe, and so throughout

this Reader, I will show you my slides so that you can meet them,

too! They represent five vertebrate groups of animals. As they are

introduced, remember to think about how a scientist might classify

each one of my new friends. How is each one like you and how is each

one different from you?


Here’s Paolo [ _pow_ -lo] Piranha from Colombia. This is Tabitha Toad

from Brazil. Here’s Anna Anaconda from Peru. This is Ebenezer

[eb-uh- _nee_ -zer] Egret from South Africa. And meet Hilda Hippo from

Tanzania. Please welcome Paolo, Tabitha, Anna, Ebenezer, and Hilda

to your classroom. They are going to appear from time to time in my

slides as you learn about five vertebrate groups of animals. Be sure

to keep a sharp eye out for them—you never know when one of them

might turn up!


Aren’t they a handsome bunch? They all belong to the animal

kingdom like you and me. And, they are like us in another way: they all

have backbones.


Lesson 2 Classifying Animals
**47**

Now, things get tricky. We are all animals and we are all vertebrates, but

we are not all the same, are we? Heavens, no! We have lots of differences

as well. You and I belong to the class, or group, called mammals. What

makes mammals different from other classes of animals is that they

have fur or hair, and the mothers give birth to live babies and feed their

babies with the milk their bodies produce. You will learn more about

these and other characteristics of mammals another day.


My friend Hilda Hippo is indeed a mammal, even though it is hard to

see the little bit of hair around her mouth and on the tips of her ears

and tail. When I was in Tanzania, Hilda and I had a visit with a proud

new mother hippopotamus! Look at her with her baby.


So, I’m a mammal, you’re a mammal, and Hilda is a mammal. But

my other friends have different classifications. One of them is in

the reptile class—a scaly creature that likes to warm itself in the

sunshine— Anna Anaconda! Isn’t she beautiful? She’s one of the

largest snakes in the world. Though she is not venemous, her strong

muscles help her constrict, or squeeze, her prey!


Another of my friends is an amphibian, which means that she

lays eggs and lives both in and out of water. Most animals in the

amphibian class have smooth, wet skin, but my friend’s skin is rather

dry and leathery. Who is she? Right again—Tabitha Toad! She looks a

lot like her close relative, the frog, doesn’t she? Her skin helps protect

her as it is camouflaged, or able to blend into the environment.


My last two friends should be easy to classify because their

classification names are much more common to all of us. Which one

of my friends is a member of the bird class? Yes—Ebenezer Egret!

Ebenezer is a warm-blooded vertebrate with feathers.


Paolo Piranha is the last of my friends to be classified today. Which

group does Paolo belong to? Paolo Piranha is a fish. He has fins and

gills, and lives in water. Piranhas, though small, are thought by many to

be dangerous because of their very sharp teeth. Don’t worry. Paolo, like

many other piranhas, usually feeds on dead and injured wild animals.


Taxonomists classify all of the vertebrate animals on Earth into

one of these five general groups—fish, amphibians, reptiles,


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


birds, and mammals. In the fish group, there are three different

subgroups of fish; fish also have the largest number of species

among vertebrates. Even though there are more than 60,000 known

species of vertebrates on Earth, there are nearly a million and a half

invertebrates—and a million of those are insects!


Earth—far into the rainforests, inside the cold ice of glaciers, within the

hot lava of volcanoes, and deep down in the ocean. Perhaps one day _you_

will discover new animals yourselves, examine and classify them by their

different characteristics, and add to our understanding of taxonomy.


**Show Image U2.L2.10**
Classification questions


Let’s think about what you’ve learned

today. Scientists classify organisms,

including animals, in order to

show relationships between them.

Animals are classified by common

characteristics. Vertebrate animals have backbones, whereas

invertebrates do not. Some are warm-blooded, whereas others are

cold-blooded. We will learn more about warm-blooded and cold
blooded animals in other readings and Read-Alouds.


Let’s think about other ways that scientists might classify animals. It is

important to consider where animals live—their habitats. Do they live in

water or on land? Do they live in warm climates or cold climates? What

covers their bodies—feathers or scales, fur or hair? Do they lay eggs

or do they give birth to live creatures that look like smaller versions of

**49**


**50**



themselves? What kinds of food do they eat—plants, animals, or both?

These are all important questions for taxonomists to ask as they work to

group animals into categories that are easily studied.


In the upcoming Read-Alouds, you will learn much more about how

animals are classified. Next time, we will pick up with the slide show

so that I can teach you about the groups of animals to which Tabitha

Toad, Anna Anaconda, and Paolo Piranha belong. Can anyone make a

prediction about which of my friends are warm-blooded animals like

me? Well, you’ll have to wait until next time to see if you are right!


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Timed Activity (10 min): Point to the chart papers posted around the room.
Explain that each chart paper lists one of the animals discussed in the
passage. With a pencil, students will move from chart paper to chart paper
and add additional information they learned about each animal.


  - As a whole group, review the information listed on the animal charts (5 min.).


Teacher note: Ensure that the charts have correct information listed for each
animal. Students should have classified the animals as amphibian, mammal,
bird, fish or reptile. They should also include that they are vertebrates and
have backbones.


  - Write the word _classify_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. If
necessary, review syllable patterns at this time.


  - In the Read-Aloud you heard, “. . . [the scientist] Linnaeus decided to use

[people’s] ideas to create a worldwide system to _classify_, or group, plants
and animals based on their shared characteristics.”


  - The word _classify_ means to sort or group things according to
common characteristics.


  - In order to organize, study, and compare animals, scientists classify them by
their common or shared characteristics.


  - Have you ever had to classify something? What was it? If not, can you
imagine something that you might have to classify this school year? Be sure
to use the word _classify_ when you tell about it.


**TEKS 3.7.F** Respond using newly acquired vocabulary as appropriate.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


  - Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’
responses to make complete sentences: “I have had to classify . . .”


  - What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _classify_ ?


  - Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up. Directions: I will name a person.
I want you to think about what types of things this person may classify in
his or her job. For example, if I say, “teacher,” you might say, “The teacher
may classify her students into groups of boys and girls.” Be sure to use the
word _classify_ in a complete sentence when you share. (Answers may vary for
all examples.)


1. A grocery store worker


» A grocery store worker may classify the food in the grocery store.


2. A librarian/media specialist


» The librarian/media specialist may classify the books, magazines, and videos in

the library.


3. An astronomer


» An astronomer may classify the stars, planets, comets, and galaxies in

**Nouns**

  - Direct students to the poster you prepared. Beginning with nouns, ask
students to help make a list on the board of nouns that name things they can
see in the room. (desk, board, Sandra, paper, pencil, girl, boy, door, window,
Mrs. Smith, floor, wall, etc.)


  - Remind students about the difference between the _features_ of common and
proper nouns. (Common nouns name people, places, or things in general,
while proper nouns name specific people, places, or things.) Examples could
be: boy, school, city (common nouns), Jake Johnson, Washington School,

_give_, _run_, _jump_, _hop_, _skip_, and _fly_ .

**Adjectives**

  - Now, move to adjectives and redirect students to the poster you prepared.
Remind students that the _features_ of adjectives are that they can answer the
questions _how many_, _what kind of_, _what color_, _what shape_, etc.


  - Have students look back at the list of nouns on the board and add adjectives
to describe them. ( _wooden_ desk, _white_ board, _lined_ paper, _sharpened_ pencil,
_smart_ girl, _tall_ boy, _closed_ door, _broken_ window, _clean_ floor, _covered_ wall, etc.)


  - Remind students that the words _a_, _an_, and _the_ are all a special kind of

  - Next, write the following sentences on the board and ask students to direct
you in identifying the nouns, verbs, and adjectives.


    - The noisy birds sat in the small trees.


    - The large, powerful gorilla ate five yellow bananas.


  - Circle the nouns, draw a wiggly line under the verbs, and draw a box around
the adjectives. Draw an arrow from the adjective to the noun it describes.

- Tell students that today we will be reading and listening to passages about
vertebrates and invertebrates.


- Write _vertebrate_ and _invertebrate_ on the board. From _vertebrate,_ draw a line
and write “an animal with a backbone.” From _invertebrate,_ draw a line and
write “an animal without a backbone.” Explain that many times, scientists
refer to a backbone as a spine.


- Explain to students that throughout the reading, they will write key concepts
and animals on their vertebrate and invertebrate cards. Students will use
these notes to help them determine if the animals on the chart paper are
vertebrates or invertebrates.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


~~**WHOLE GROUP READING (25 MIN.)**~~


**Pages 19–20**

  - Read the title of the chapter together as a class, “Vertebrate
or Invertebrate?”


  - Ask students, “Where in the Reader could we find the definition for
vertebrate quickly?”


» the glossary


  - Have students read the caption and look at the images on **page 20** .


  - Ask: “Looking at the pictures and caption, what information can we gain from
these text features?”


» We learn that scientists classify living things by different characteristics.


Lesson 3 Vertebrate or Invertebrate?
**61**


**62**




- Ask students to read **pages 19–20** to themselves and think about this
question: “How do the photos and caption support the text?”


- When students are finished reading, restate the question and ask them
to answer.


» The text states that scientists classify animals by their skin, how they give birth,

how and what mothers feed their babies, and whether they are warm- or

cold-blooded. All of the photos show pictures of each of the ways animals

are classified.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Pages 21–22**

  - Have students read the caption and look at the image on **page 22** . Have
students feel the series of bones in their back that make up their backbone or
spine.


  - Ask students to read **pages 21–22** to themselves and record any important
information on their vertebrate or invertebrate cards.


  - When students are finished reading, have them share the important
information they wrote on their cards.


Check for Understanding


If students did not identify the backbone/spine as being a connection
to vertebrates, then reread the first paragraph aloud and highlight the
sentence: Animals that have backbones are called vertebrates.

**63**


Challenge


Have students categorize
the vertebrate animals
they listed by another
characteristic (mammals,
reptiles, fish, and birds).


Support


Pair up with students who

vertebrate animals. Assist
the students in going
back into the text to find
the animals.


**64**



**Pages 23–24**

 - Explain to students that as the text is read aloud, they will need to record five
examples of vertebrates on their vertebrate card.


 - Read aloud **page 23** .


 - Ask students to share with a partner the five examples of vertebrates they
recorded on their vertebrate card.


» Students may choose among apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, bats, rats, humans,

lizards, turtles, snakes, crocodiles, sharks, goldfish, hummingbirds, and eagles.


 - Explain to students that as the text is read aloud, they will need to record five
examples of invertebrates on their invertebrate card.


 - Read aloud the first paragraph on **page 24** .

recorded on their invertebrate card.


» Students may choose among flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs,

butterflies, earthworms, and spiders.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


~~**DISCUSSING THE READING (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Go back to the chart used at the beginning of the lesson. Explain to students
that the animals on the chart will be called out again. Students must first
decide if the animal is a vertebrate or invertebrate and then hold up the
corresponding card to show their response. Students may also use their
notes from their cards to help them classify the animals.


**Note:** The teacher will record the number of students that selected

vertebrate and invertebrates on the chart.


  - As a whole group, complete Activity Page 3.1.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask: “What is classification?”


» A classification is a grouping together of things based on how they are alike and

the separating of things based on how they are different.


 - Explain to students that they are going to listen to a text that focuses on
vertebrate animals. Students will add additional notes to their vertebrate and
invertebrate cards from earlier in the lesson. After listening to the text, they
are going to determine the main point and supporting details of passages
from the reading and Read-Aloud selections.


~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Say: “During the Read-Aloud of the first paragraph, listen for the most
important point.”


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Show Image U2.L3.1**
Animals and their spines


Hello, everybody. Rattenborough,

world traveler and presenter of

animals, back for another exciting day

of slide show and tell! Remember my

friend Hilda the Hippo? We are actually like her. Do you know how?

We are all vertebrates. That’s right—vertebrates have backbones. And

animals without backbones are called _in_ vertebrates. Because you

and I are both vertebrates, we’ll talk about vertebrates first. Let’s take

a look at the hippopotamus.


Check for Understanding


What is the important point from the first paragraph in the Read-Aloud?

» Vertebrates have backbones and invertebrates do not.


When you look at the outside of an animal, you can’t see the

backbone because it is on the inside. But sometimes you can tell

where the backbone is. Under a vertebrate’s skin, there is a ridge.

This is the backbone, or **spine,** that starts near its head and runs

all the way down its back to its tail. Find your backbone again.

Remember those bumpy bones? Each bump you feel is a separate

**vertebra.** They form a row from your neck all the way down your

back to your tailbone. Your spine serves a very important purpose.

Your spine protects your spinal cord, that large bundle of **nerves** that

sends messages from your brain to every part of your body.


Let’s look at the backbones of the five animal species to which my

five friends belong. We’ve seen that a hippopotamus has a backbone.

Next let’s look at one of Ebenezer’s fellow egrets. Its backbone, or

spinal **column,** helps it hold its head up high and protects its spinal

cord. Like all egrets, Ebenezer could not live without his backbone. All

birds have backbones, or vertebrae.



Support


Review the five animal
species with backbones:
reptiles, amphibians, fish,
mammals, and birds.



Lesson 3 Vertebrate or Invertebrate?
**67**


Support


Tell students to add notes
to their vertebrate and
invertebrate cards during
the next part of the
Read-Aloud.


Support


What additional
information did you add to
your vertebrate note card?


» Some animals have
lighter and more
bendable cartilage
instead of hard bone.


**68**



Snakes don’t look like they have backbones, do they? Even though

snakes **slither** —or slip and slide along—they absolutely _do_ have

backbones! A snake’s vertebrae, like Anna Anaconda’s, run the

length of its body and swing low to the ground as its muscles help it

move along the ground or climb up trees. A pair of ribs is attached to

each vertebra, protecting the body parts inside the snake’s body. All

reptiles have backbones. So, you can’t always tell from the outside

whether an animal is a vertebrate with a spine (backbone), or

whether it’s an invertebrate.


How about fish? Would you say fish have backbones? The answer is

yes! All fish have backbones, just as reptiles, birds, and mammals

do. It’s very tricky to see, but if you took an x-ray of its body, you

would see that all the other tiny bones that make up the skeleton of

the fish are connected to its spine. Paolo told me that even though

all fish have backbones, some fish—like sharks and stingrays—have

backbones that are made of lighter and more bendable **cartilage**

instead of hard bone, allowing them to be more flexible and travel

more quickly.


That leaves amphibians. Take a look at my animal friends one more

time; pay close attention to the toad next to Tabitha. It’s hard to tell

when you look at a toad’s body that there is a backbone inside! Now

tell me—do toads have backbones? Yes, to be sure, they certainly

do! Toads are vertebrates, too! All amphibians have backbones! That

means that all five of the animals you’ve seen today are vertebrates.

They all have backbones. The question I’m going to present to you,

students, is this: Do all animals on Earth have backbones?


What are your predictions, boys and girls? We know that mammals—

which include hippopotami, me, you, birds, fish, reptiles, and

amphibians—are all vertebrates, too. Have we covered all the animal

groups on Earth? Aha! Trick question! If you said no, your predictions

were correct.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


Check for Understanding


Ask students what they recall about insects from the Reader.


Do you remember if there are more vertebrates or more invertebrates

on Earth? Good ideas! Look at this image that I shared with you

earlier. Remember, more than 95 percent of all animal species are

invertebrates, and insects are the biggest group of invertebrates. And

there are still so many invertebrates yet to be discovered and classified!


As you can see in the image, vertebrates are actually only a teeny tiny

group here on Earth. Because we tend to think and talk mostly about

vertebrates, we sometimes forget that most of the animals in the

world are actually invertebrates—and most of those are insects!


**Show Image U2.L3.2**
Insects


Think how many insects there must

be on our planet! They make up

three-quarters of all the species

in the animal kingdom! Can you

name a few of the many animals in the insect group? Flies, wasps,

beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies are all insects. There

are surely a lot more species of insects than there are species of

amphibians, mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles all put together!


Even though insects are by far the largest group of invertebrates,

they are not the only invertebrates. Here’s another question for you

to think about. Close your eyes and pretend you are a taxonomist for

a moment. Can you think of any other animals without backbones?

Here’s a hint: instead of internal vertebrae, these animals have an

external, or outer, hard body covering.


Lesson 3 Vertebrate or Invertebrate?
**69**


**70**



**Show Image U2.L3.3**
Insects and arachnids


The largest group of invertebrates is

made up of arthropods. Insects make

up the largest group of arthropods.

Another large group of arthropods

includes arachnids. Spiders are arachnids, and so are ticks, daddy

longlegs, and scorpions. Insects have six legs and three body parts.

The ant in this image has very long antennae—they almost look like

legs! In comparison, arachnids have eight legs and two body parts.

Instead of having flexible internal skeletons, all of the arthropods

wear a tough **exoskeleton**, or protective covering, on the outside.

I bet you can recognize some of these common examples of insects

and arachnids.


**Show Image U2.L3.4**
Crustaceans


A crustacean is another kind of

invertebrate and also a type of

arthropod. Crustaceans have

exoskeletons and usually live in water.

Copepods are the smallest of the crustaceans. They are barely

visible, but they are a very important source of food for fish in the

ocean. Can anyone think of other animals that are classified as

crustaceans? Good ideas! Some of the more common crustaceans

include shrimp, lobsters, fiddler crabs, and blue crabs. These animals

all have a hard exoskeleton, which protects the body and keeps it

from drying out. Have you ever seen a crab? If you eat a blue crab like

this one or a lobster, you have to remove its hard exoskeleton to find

the tasty meat inside.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Show Image U2.L3.5**
Other invertebrates


Snails, jellyfish, and earthworms are

also invertebrates. Other spineless

creatures include coral, sea anemones,

and sea stars. Many invertebrates are

small and hidden and may not even seem like animals, but they are by

far the largest group of animals populating the Earth.



Challenge


Have students create
a master list of all
vertebrates and
invertebrates discussed
in the reading and ReadAloud.







**Show Image U2.L3.6**
Classification of a housecat


What a lot of ways there are to

classify animals! The purpose of

this classification system is to

understand each organism better by



the characteristics that make it unique. Vertebrates and invertebrates

are two types of animals in the world of taxonomy. It is just one way of

classifying animals, but I think it is a very helpful way, don’t you? You and

I may not look at all alike, or much like Ebenezer, Tabitha, or Anna, but

we have a very distinct similarity to one another. We all have backbones!


Look at this chart that shows how a group of familiar organisms

are related to each other. On the top row, you can see a group of

living organisms: a housecat, a jungle cat, a tiger, a seal, a turtle, a

grasshopper, and a tree. In the next row titled “Kingdom,” notice that

one of the living organisms is no longer included: the tree. The tree

actually belongs to a different kingdom. This row now shows only

organisms that are part of the animal kingdom. In the next row, titled

“Phylum,” the grasshopper is no longer included. All of the rest of

the animals represented here are vertebrates, part of the chordata

phylum. In looking at the “Class” row, you may notice that the turtle

is no longer included. The turtle is in the reptile class, and all of the

other animals shown are mammals. In the row labeled “Order,” the

mouse is not included because it is not a carnivore like the other


Lesson 3 Vertebrate or Invertebrate?
**71**


Activity Page 3.2



animals shown. What’s true about all the animals in the next row,

“Family?” That’s right; they are all different types of cats. In the

“ _Genus_ ” row, you can see that the housecat and jungle cat are more

closely related than the tiger. And the very last row represents one

specific animal, a _species_ of housecat.


This process of starting out with many animals and ending up with

just one is called the process of elimination. As we went down the list,

we eliminated—or removed—any animals that no longer had anything

in common.

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U2.L4.1**
Rattenborough’s scrapbook page,
“Vertebrate Animals Around the World”


Hi, boys and girls. I have brought

along my slide show once again.

Today we’re going to look at slides

of my friends, some of whom are **cold-blooded** animals and some

of whom are **warm-blooded** animals. By the sound of it, you would

think that warm-blooded animals have warm blood and cold
blooded animals have cold blood, but this is not the case. The body

temperature of a cold-blooded animal changes according to the

surroundings, or environment of that animal, whereas a warm
blooded animal maintains about the same temperature all of the

time. I heard that you are keeping a foldable to sort, or classify,

animals into groups. What a great idea! You are practicing taxonomy,

the study of classifying organisms, exactly like taxonomists do!


You’re going to be learning how to sort animals in lots of different

ways. Today we are going to sort these five vertebrate groups into two

smaller groups. By discovering some common characteristics, you’ll

learn how to tell which animals are cold-blooded and which animals

are warm-blooded. Now I’d like to help you understand a little more

about cold-blooded animals.


**Show Image U2.L4.2**
Paolo and piranhas


Paolo Piranha lives in the country

of Colombia on the continent of

South America. He’s a fish. His body

temperature, the measure of how

warm his body is on the inside, changes with his surroundings.

Right now, his temperature is the same as the water in which he is

swimming. When _you_ go swimming, chances are the water is colder


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


than your body temperature. Paolo does not ever feel cold in water,

because there is no difference between his temperature and the

water temperature where he lives.


**Show Image U2.L4.3**
Taking child’s temperature


Have any of you ever used a

thermometer? Perhaps when you are

sick, your parents or a nurse might

measure your temperature with a

thermometer. When warm-blooded people get ill, their temperatures

often rise, or go up. A person’s normal body temperature is about

98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and it remains **constant,** or about the

same, most of the time. That’s very different from Paolo! The way

in which an animal’s body temperature is controlled determines

whether it is a cold-blooded or warm-blooded animal.


My friend Paolo told me that his **internal,** or inside, body temperature

is never constant. It does not stay the same. He cannot heat his body

from the inside like you, so his temperature must change with his

surroundings in order for his body to work properly. He becomes hot

when it is hot around him and cold when it is cold around him.


  - Picture Pause: Explain to students that during the next part of the ReadAloud, they should listen for the central idea.


So, you see, although you and Paolo are both vertebrates, you also

have differences. One of you is cold-blooded and one of you is warm
blooded. You’re right! You are warm-blooded. So that makes Paolo …

Yes! Cold-blooded! Most fish are cold-blooded. In fact, most animals

on Earth are cold-blooded. Two of my other friends are cold-blooded

as well. Does anyone know who else among them is cold-blooded?

Great answers! Next, I’d like to tell you a little about Anna Anaconda.


Lesson 4 Warm- or Cold-Blooded?
**85**


**86**




- Picture Pause: Model for the whole class that the central idea is that
vertebrates are warm- and cold-blooded. This is what the paragraph is
mostly about.


**Show Image U2.L4.4**
Anna and anaconda


Like Paolo, Anna lives in the rainforest

of South America, but in the country

of Peru. Does anyone remember

what group of animals Anna belongs

to? That’s right! Anna Anaconda is

classified as a reptile, and she shares some of Paolo’s characteristics.

They’re both cold-blooded, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t

enjoy being warm. Anna loves the heat! Her body is very long indeed,

and she told me that one of her favorite things to do is **bask** in the

sun. The sun helps her stay warm, and her body soaks up the heat

from the warm ground as well. Because she cannot control her

own body temperature, Anna depends upon the sun and her warm

surroundings to keep properly warm. In fact, my other cold-blooded

friend, Tabitha Toad, likes the sun, too!


**Show Image U2.L4.5**
Tabitha and toad


Frogs and toads share some of the

same characteristics as fish and

reptiles. They use their surroundings

to maintain—or keep constant—the

proper body temperature. Yes, indeed, Tabitha Toad is cold-blooded,

just like Paolo and Anna.


And, like Paolo and Anna, Tabitha is very comfortable around water.

She comes from the Amazon rainforest in the country of Brazil. But

just because her home is near the largest river in the world, it doesn’t

mean she lives in water all the time. Tabitha and all toads are actually

more comfortable on land, whereas frogs prefer to be wet. Tabitha is an

amphibian, which means that she can live both in and out of the water.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


- Picture Pause: Explain to students that during the next part of the ReadAloud, they should listen for the central idea.


So, there you have it—fish, reptile, amphibian—three groups of

cold-blooded creatures. Their body temperatures change depending

upon where they are, becoming warm when their surroundings are

warm and cold when it’s cold around them. Because they do not

have constant body temperatures, they can easily become too hot

or too cold. These characteristics and behaviors help them survive in

certain habitats.


- Picture Pause: Ask students to recall the central idea: Fish, reptiles, and
amphibians are all cold-blooded.


- Have students classify fish, reptiles, and amphibians as cold-blooded on
Activity Page 3.2.


**Show Image U2.L4.6**
Ebenezer and egret


Let’s learn a little about two of my

other friends, my warm-blooded

friends—a bird, Ebenezer Egret,

and a fellow mammal, Hilda Hippo.

Mammals and birds produce their own body heat internally, which

keeps their body temperatures constant.


One thing’s for sure: Ebenezer Egret does not put on a winter coat

like you do when it’s cold outside! Of course, he doesn’t need to put

on an extra coat because he already has a brilliant coat of feathers!

Feathers help keep Ebenezer warm. Want to know an interesting

fact that Ebenezer shared with me while I was visiting South Africa?

Egrets’ beautiful white feathers were once prized by hat-makers who

used them for the sake of women’s hat fashion and beauty—not

warmth. Imagine that! Birds that live in climates that change with the

seasons sometimes travel to make it easier to stay warm and find

more available food. Often, physical characteristics help an animal

stay warm. Ebenezer wears a coat of feathers, and I wear a coat of

fur. Are you wondering what Hilda Hippo uses for a little additional

warmth because she doesn’t have fur? Let’s take a look and see!


**Show Image U2.L4.7**
Hilda and hippopotamus


I have a bit of news for you—in the hot

tropical climates of Africa where Hilda

Hippo lives, trying to stay cool is a

more common occurrence than trying

to stay warm. Hilda’s characteristics are perfect for helping her stay

cool! She has a nice layer of blubber that insulates her and helps her

float. Hippopotami spend lots of time in the water of lakes and rivers

to escape the heat. Can you see any other characteristics of the

hippopotamus that help it stay in the water for long periods of time?

Good observations! Notice how having its nostrils, eyes, and ears

on the top of its head lets the hippopotamus keep most of its body

under water where it can stay cool!


Ebenezer also uses water to stay cool. Even though egrets can’t swim,

they do spend lots of time wading in the water, mostly to get their

dinner! They feast on fish and toads and plenty of insects in order to

store up the energy needed to control their body temperature.


Well, everybody, our time is up for today. You have learned a lot about

the taxonomy of cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals, so now

you can fill in your Foldable. I can’t wait to see all of you again and

continue with the show! Bye for now!

» fish, amphibians, reptiles


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


2. What groups of animals did you hear about that are warm-blooded?


» birds and mammals


3. **Literal.** What do we mean when we say an animal is warm-blooded?


» It regulates its body temperature internally to keep a constant internal

temperature all the time.


4. **Short Constructed Response.** You learned that humans are warm-blooded

animals. Why is it that humans can live in many different environments? Write

your response using complete sentences. When finished, share with a partner.


~~**TEKS 3.6.F**~~

when the outside temperatures are especially hot.


» sweat, pant, drink water, go in cool water


6. **Evaluative.** You learned that humans are warm-blooded animals. Why is it

that humans can live in many different environments?


» Warm-blooded animals regulate their body temperature internally; energy from

food helps warm them; they add or remove layers of clothing; they heat or cool

their house; etc.


  - Write the word _constant_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. If
necessary, review syllable patterns at this time.


  - In the Read-Aloud, you heard, “A person’s normal body temperature is about
98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and it remains _constant_ . . . ”


  - Something that is constant does not change very much; it stays steady
and even.


  - “Miguel’s grandfather is a constant support to him when he needs help with
his math homework.”


  - Have you ever noticed something or someone in your life that is constant, or
that stays steady? What or who is it? Be sure to use the word _constant_ when
you tell about it.


  - Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’
responses to make complete sentences: “The thing in my life that stays
constant is .”


  - What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _constant_ ?

  - Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up. Directions: “I am going to name
a situation. If what I name is an example of something that is steady and
constant, say, ‘That is constant.’ If what I name is an example of something
that changes a lot and is not constant, say, ‘That is not constant.’”


    - On some days, Janine is friendly to me and on other days she doesn’t
talk to me.


» _That is not constant._


    - My aunt is always willing to talk when I have a problem to solve.

» _That is constant._


    - My pet snake’s temperature goes up and down depending on whether she
is lying under the heat lamp or not.


» _That is not constant._


    - Eating a good breakfast every day helps me think clearly at school.

» _That is constant._


    - Sam’s internal body temperature stays about the same whether it is a
cold, blustery winter night or a hot, muggy summer afternoon.

**Prefix**


A **prefix** is a syllable placed in front of a root word. Prefixes change the
meaning of the root word.




- Emphasize for students that the _features_ of prefixes are that they are added
to the beginning of a root word, they change the meaning of the root word,
they add a syllable to the beginning of the root word, and they may change
the part of speech of the word.


- Tell students that the two prefixes they will study this week are _un–_ and _non–_ .
Explain that both _un–_ and _non–_ have the same meaning, which is “not.”


- Write the word _safe_ on the board or chart paper. Discuss the meaning of
the word.


» Protected from harm or danger; It is safe to cross the street when the police

officer signals us to go.


- Add the prefix _un–_ to safe and have students read the prefix, read the new
word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word.


» not protected from harm or danger


- Ask students for examples of things that could be described as _unsafe_ .


» Answers may vary but could include broken glass, wires hanging down, riding a

bicycle without a helmet, etc.


- Write the root word _living_ in cursive on the board or chart paper and provide
time for students to read the word prior to discussing. Briefly discuss the

~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** How do fish move through the water?


» They use their fins and tails.


2. **Inferential.** Why are scales an important physical characteristic of fish?


» They offer protection and help them move through the water.


3. **Evaluative.** You and a friend are discussing whether or not a shark is a fish.

How would you convince your friend that a shark is a fish?


» Like other fish, sharks live in water and have gills though which they take in oxygen;

they have scaly skin; their tails and fins help them move through the water.


  - Write the word _aquatic_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. If
necessary, review syllable patterns at this time.


  - In the Read-Aloud, you heard Rattenborough say, “Today I’m going to teach
you a little more about the aquatic species of animals that are classified as fish.”


  - _Aquatic_ means “having to do with water.”


  - Eli visited the pet store every weekend because he loved to watch the turtles
swimming and playing in their aquatic environment.


  - Have you ever seen something that was aquatic? Where were you? Would
you consider yourself to be aquatic? What aquatic activities do you do?
Be sure to use the word _aquatic_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three
students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to
make complete sentences: “At the creek we watched aquatic animals  ”
or “I like the aquatic activity of  .”)


  - Have you ever heard of something described as aquatic? What part of
speech is the word _aquatic_ ?


  - Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up. Directions: “I am going to say a
phrase that describes something that is aquatic or not aquatic. If the phrase
is about something that is aquatic, say, ‘That is aquatic.’ If the phrase is not
about something aquatic, say, ‘That is not aquatic.’”

~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 2, Lesson 5**

  - Students are likely to make the following errors:


    - doubling all of the final consonants before adding the suffixes


    - not doubling any of the final consonants before adding the suffixes


  - While either of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still
be aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find
it helpful to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the
analysis chart. For example: Is the student consistently making errors on
specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular
beginning consonants?


    - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


    - Also, examine the dictated sentence for errors in capitalization
and punctuation.

  - **Common Bond:** Have students take out Activity Page 6.1 and provide time
for students to complete.


  - Tell students that in today’s Read-Aloud, they will learn more about another
group of animals: amphibians. Explain to students that the word _amphibian_
means “living two lives” or “living in two worlds.” Ask students to predict what
they think this means as it pertains to the amphibians animal group.


  - Explain to students that one way to understand the text is to think about the
connections to the text. Readers are always thinking: How does this event
connect to the next event? Or what are the steps in this text? Authors share
information in a few different formats.


  - Project or display the Text Structures chart (DP.U2.L6.1). Read aloud the
various text structures listed.


  - Explain that during today’s lesson the focus will be on sequence.


  - “As you listen today, keep an ear out for the Clue Words from the chart. When
you hear one of the sequencing key words, raise your hand.”


  - As you read, model appropriate rate and prosody (expression). Model using
an inquisitive tone with sentences that are questions and an excited tone
with sentences using exclamation marks. At the end, ask students what they
noticed about your reading. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U2.L6.1**
Rainforest with Tabitha


I’m back, everybody, and today I’ve

brought some excellent slides of

Tabitha Toad and Paolo Piranha to

show you, so we can compare how

scientists classify them in the taxonomy of animals. Tabitha is not a

fish, but she and Paolo are similar in many ways. It’s true that Tabitha

and Paolo don’t look very much alike, but as the saying goes, you

can’t judge a book by its cover. When classifying animals, scientists

often search for similarities as well as differences.


One similarity between Tabitha and Paolo is that, as you know,

they are both members of the animal kingdom. You’ve learned that

scientists classify animals as cold-blooded or warm-blooded. Does

anyone know to which category Tabitha belongs? Do you think that

her body maintains a constant internal temperature like yours, or

does her temperature adjust to her surroundings like a fish does?

Yes, her body temperature fluctuates, so she is classified as a cold
blooded animal like Paolo. That’s another way that they are similar to

one another. They are both animals and they are both cold-blooded.


**Show Image U2.L6.2**
Toad, and toad with vertebrae


Now take a closer look at Tabitha Toad. Can

you tell just by looking at her whether she

is cold-blooded or warm-blooded? No, but

once you learn a bit more about her habits

you will understand how scientists determined that she is cold-blooded. You

know that scientists also classify animals according to whether or not they

Support


Reread the sentence: “Most
amphibians spend part of
their lives in water and part
on land.” The text explains
how frogs begin their lives
in water and, as they grow,
they move on land.

Challenge


Have students analyze and
explain the text structure
the author used in the first
part of the Read-Aloud

Support


Remind students that we
learned about _aquatic_ in
the lessons about fish.
_Aquatic_ means having to

have backbones. Think about what you learned about Tabitha’s backbone.

Yes, there it is! Just like you and Paolo, Tabitha has vertebrae, a column of

bones, all down her back. Who remembers what scientists call animals with

backbones? Right! She’s a vertebrate!


So, Paolo and Tabitha are both cold-blooded vertebrates. Does anyone

remember any other fish characteristics? Good answers! Make a prediction

about which characteristics Tabitha shares with Paolo. Do Tabitha and other

toads have gills, scales, or fins? Do they lay eggs? Or live in water? These

are rather tricky questions because toads belong to a group of animals that

change during their lifetime. Their bodies change, their habits change, and

their ecosystems change. I’m going to share lots of information with you

today, so get ready for some miraculous surprises.


Before we go any further, I want to introduce the name of Tabitha Toad’s

group of animals. Some of you may know it already. How do scientists classify

toads? Yes, they are members of a class of animals known as **amphibians** .

Most amphibians spend part of their lives in water and part on land.


**Show Image U2.L6.3**
Tabitha jumping in and out of the water


Toads love the water. Like all

amphibians, Tabitha began her life as

an aquatic animal, living in water. She

spends most of her time on dry land

now. In fact, she loves the woodlands, but every spring she makes her

way to a small freshwater pond in the wetland.


First, she will lay her eggs. Just before I took this picture, she laid a

few thousand eggs in the shallow water. Toads must lay their eggs in

water because their soft, jelly-like coverings can easily dry out in the

air. Come and see!


- **Picture Pause:** Stop to identify _first_ as a sequence word in the text. As a whole
group, write down the following sentence from the text onto Activity Page 6.2:


  - _First,_ she will lay her eggs.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


Check for Understanding


If students did not raise their hand when _first_ was read aloud, then review
the Text Structure chart for the key words for sequencing.


**Show Image U2.L6.4**
Toad eggs


Most of the eggs will never hatch.

Can anyone think of why this is so?

There are many ways that eggs can be

destroyed: by becoming a tasty meal

for a predator, being washed away in a flood, or drying up if there’s

not enough rain.


Next, a few hundred toad eggs will hatch into tadpoles. Tadpoles have

gills, just like fish, and use their gills to breathe underwater. They are

herbivores and eat tiny aquatic plants, but they’re in constant danger

because other fish can swallow them whole.


- **Picture Pause:** Stop to identify _next_ as a sequence word in the text. As a
whole group, write down the following sentence from the text onto Activity
Page 6.2:


  - _Next,_ a few hundred toad eggs will hatch into tadpoles.


**Show Image U2.L6.5**
Tadpole’s metamorphosis


Then, the tadpoles will morph, or

change, into very different-looking

creatures, young amphibians,

with very different habits. This

transformation process of changing appearance from one stage

to another is called metamorphosis. Skin has covered their gills

and they grew lungs for breathing air on land. Tiny legs have

also appeared.

- **Picture Pause:** Stop to identify _then_ as a sequence word in the text. As a
whole group, write down the following sentence from the text onto Activity
Page 6.2: Then, the tadpoles will morph, or change, into very differentlooking creatures, young amphibians, with very different habits.


Lastly, young amphibians will grow into adult toads. Those

amphibians that survive to adulthood will be hopping and crawling

around on land, searching for food, just like Tabitha. Plant life will

no longer interest them. Instead, they’ll snatch up bugs, worms,

spiders, and slugs with their sticky tongues. Most adult amphibians

are carnivores. Some of the toad’s larger relatives, like bullfrogs, even

eat small mammals and birds. The world’s biggest frog is the West

African Goliath frog. It is the size of a pet cat and eats other frogs,

baby crabs, and snakes.


- **Picture Pause:** Stop to identify _lastly_ as a sequence word in the text. As a
whole group, write down the following sentence from the text onto Activity
Page 6.2:


  - _Lastly,_ young amphibians will grow into adult toads.


Frogs and toads are the largest group of amphibians. Because they

have so many of the same characteristics, many people have a

difficult time telling them apart. The main difference between them

is that toads’ skin is a bit drier than frogs’ skin. Remember that

although together they make up the largest group of amphibians,

they are not the _only_ group of amphibians.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


Next time we meet, you will learn all about the way scientists classify

snakes like Anna Anaconda. I’ll give you a hint. Remember when I

said that salamanders are often mistaken for lizards, but that lizards

belong to a different group of animals? Well, Anna belongs to the

same group as lizards. Does anyone want to predict the name of that

group? Wait and see if you’re right. For now, I want to congratulate

you all on being such good sleuths, or detectives! Any taxonomist

would love to have your help in classifying Earth’s animals. See

you soon!


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** After toads become adults they live on dry land. Why do they go

back to the wetlands every spring?


» to lay eggs


2. **Inferential.** In the Read-Aloud, you learned that a tadpole breathes through

gills like fish because it lives mostly underwater. How do adult frogs

breathe?


» with lungs and through their skin


3. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share_ : _Amphibian_ means “living two lives” or “two

worlds.” Describe the transformation frogs go through in their lifetimes.

Try to use signal words to describe the sequence of their transformation.

**Lesson 6: From Water to Land**
##### Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will produce compound sentences.


~~**TEKS 3.11.D.i; TEKS 3.11.D.viii; TEKS 3.2.D**~~



20m



Students will determine the meaning of words formed when _–ed_ and _–ing_ are added

to a known root word. ~~**[TEKS 3.3.C; TEKS 3.2.A.vi]**~~


  - Remind students they have learned to write simple sentences (those that
contain one subject and one predicate). In grammar lessons, through the
remainder of the year, they will learn to write different kinds of sentences
that are more elaborate. Today, they will take the first step to writing different
kinds of sentences by learning to identify compound sentences. Compound
sentences are sentences that contain more than one independent clause.


  - Explain that an independent clause is a clause, or part of a sentence, that has
a subject and a predicate. An independent clause can stand alone and make
sense as a separate sentence.

**Note to Teacher:** Some may confuse compound sentences with other
types of sentences that simply include a compound subject or a compound
predicate. The following examples are offered to provide clarity:


**TEKS 3.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (i) complete simple and compound sentences with subject-verb agreement; (viii) coordinating conjunctions to form compound subjects, predicates, and sentences; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write
complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words; **TEKS 3.3.C** Identify the
meaning of and use words with affixes such as im- (into), non-, dis-, in- (not, non), pre-, -ness, -y, and -ful; **TEKS 3.2.A.vi** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of suffixes, including how they can change base words
such as dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling final consonants.


Lesson 6 From Water to Land
**149**


- Direct students’ attention to the first sentence you placed on the board
in advance.






- Tell students that this is a compound sentence because it has more than one
independent clause. We know this because the sentence has two separate
parts, each with its own subject and predicate. Ask students what the subject
and predicate are in the first clause or part; mark the first clause as follows to
clearly indicate the subject and predicate. Write words in cursive.






- Ask students to identify the subject and predicate in the second clause or
part and mark the remainder of the sentence.






- Explain that this compound sentence uses the conjunction _and_ to link the
two independent clauses. Draw two lines under the conjunction _and_, pointing
out that the use of this conjunction is another clue that this may be a
compound sentence.





**150**




- Emphasize that the real test of whether a sentence is a compound
sentence is whether it has more than one independent clause joined
by a conjunction. Tell students that they can prove that the clauses
are independent clauses if each clause can stand alone as a separate
sentence with its own subject and predicate. Separate the two sentences to
illustrate this point: _Dancers wear special shoes. Football players also wear_
_special shoes._


- Direct students’ attention to the next sentence on the board, marking and
discussing it in the same manner.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


- Point out, however, the use of the conjunction _and_ in a sentence does not
automatically mean that a sentence with _and_ is a compound sentence.

- Direct students’ attention to the third sentence you placed on the board
in advance.






- Ask students if there are one or two subjects in the sentence. There are two.
Ask students what the two subjects are. ( _squirrels_ and _dogs_ ) Ask students if
there are one or two predicates in the sentence. There is one. Ask students
what the predicate is. ( _are furry animals_ ) Mark the sentence as follows:






- Tell students that this sentence is not a compound sentence. It has two
subjects, but it only has one predicate. Even though the conjunction _and_
is used, this sentence does not have more than one independent clause.
Therefore, this is not a compound sentence.

- Ask students how you might rewrite the sentence so that it is a compound
sentence. The sentence already has two subjects. It needs an additional
predicate. The sentence _Squirrels are furry animals, and dogs are furry_
_animals_ is a compound sentence because it has two subjects and
two predicates.

- Direct students’ attention to the third sentence you placed on the board
in advance.






- Ask students if there are one or two subjects in the sentence. There is one.
Ask students what the subject is. ( _fish_ ) Ask students if there are one or two
predicates in the sentence. There are two. Ask students what the predicates
are. ( _swim in the lake_ and _lay eggs_ ) Mark the sentence as follows:






  - Ask students if this is a compound sentence. It is not a compound sentence. It
has two predicates, but it only has one subject. This means there is not more
than one independent clause. Therefore, this is not a compound sentence.


  - Ask students how you might rewrite the sentence so that it is a compound

  - When introducing the words, use these procedures:

**Step 1: Introducing the Root Words**

  - Tell students these are the words on which they will be assessed. This week,
students will be responsible for spelling the root words plus the forms of
these words when the suffixes _–ed_ and _–ing_ are added. Explain that all of
the spelling words this week are verbs to which students will be adding
different suffixes.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate space between words.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


- As you introduce each of the spelling words, write it in the table, pronouncing
each word as you write it in cursive.

|Root Word|–ed|–ing|
|---|---|---|
|smile|||
|rake|||
|fle|||
|vote|||
|dine|||
|quote|||
|raise|||
|tire|||
|translate|||
|prepare|||



- Make sure to explicitly point out that the first word is the root word. Explain
that a root word is what a word is called before any prefixes or suffixes are
added to the word.


- When you reach the multisyllable words ( _translate, prepare_ ), model for
students how to chunk the word into syllables to say and spell the word.
Explain that when we have words with more than one syllable, it can be
helpful to divide a word into syllables if we don’t know how to read or spell it.


- Write the word _translate_ in cursive in the table.


- Ask students to tell you the vowel sounds in the word. Point out that this
word has a CVCe pattern with the ‘a_e’ separated vowel digraph standing for
one sound, /ae/. You may want to use two fingers to simultaneously point to
the ‘a’ and ‘e’ as you did in Unit 1 when reviewing the CVCe syllable pattern.


- Underline the vowels in the word like this:


  - translate


- “How many consonants are between the first two vowels?”


» three


- Tell students that when there are three consonants between two vowels, the
word can be divided into syllables before or after the second consonant.

 - Draw a line between the letters ‘s’ and ‘l’ like this:


   - trans | late

**Note:** For decoding and spelling purposes, it is not particularly important

whether you divide this word as noted above or as “tran | slate.” In fact, you

will find this word syllabicated either way in different dictionaries.


 - Cover the second syllable, ‘late,’ and tell students that if the word is divided in
this way, you would read this first syllable as /tranz/, since syllables ending
with consonants are generally pronounced with the short vowel sound.


 - Then, cover the first syllable, ‘trans,’ and ask students to read the last
syllable, /laet/. Again, remind students that this word has a CVCe pattern
(i.e., separated vowel digraph, so the ‘a_e’ stands for one sound, /ae/).


 - Tell students that they can now easily see the parts of the word and it is
easier to decode.


 - Write the word _prepare_ in cursive in the table.


 - Ask students to tell you the vowels in the word. Remind students that this
word has a CVCe pattern with the ‘a_e’ separated vowel digraph standing for
one sound, /air/.


 - Underline the letters that represent the vowel sounds in the word like this:


   - prepare


 - “How many consonants are between the first two vowels?”


» one


 - Tell students that when there is one consonant between two vowels, the word
can be divided into syllables before or after that single consonant.


 - Draw a line between the letters ‘e’ and ‘p’ like this:


   - pre | pare


 - Cover the second syllable, ‘pare,’ and tell students that if the word is divided
in this way, you would read this first syllable as /pree/, since syllables ending
with vowels are generally pronounced with the long vowel sound.


 - Then, cover the first syllable, ‘pre,’ and ask students to read the last syllable,
‘pare,’ Prompt students in blending and saying the word, /pree pair/, and
point out this word sounds like an English word that you recognize.

**Step 2: Adding the Suffixes –ed and –ing to the Root Words**

 - Tell students that they will now complete the remainder of the table in their
best cursive handwriting when adding the suffixes – _ed_ and – _ing_ to each root


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


word. Remind students that each root word is a verb and ask what the suffix

  - _ed_ on the end of a verb signals.


» past tense; the action has already happened


  - Ask students what the suffix – _ing_ signals. (present tense; ongoing action that
is still happening)


  - Working with each root word, add the suffixes _–ed_ and _–ing_ . Point out to
students that when words end with CVCe (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant-e),
the final ‘e’ must be dropped before adding _–ed_ or _–ing_ .


  - Also, point out to students that adding _–ed_ sometimes adds a syllable to the
word ( _voted_, _quoted_, _translated_ ) and sometimes does not ( _smiled_, _raked_,
_filed_, _dined_, _tired_, _prepared_ ); adding _–ing_ always adds a syllable to the word.


  - Additionally, point out that the suffix _–ed_ is pronounced /t/ in _raked_ .
The suffix _–ed_ is pronounced /d/ in _smiled_, _filed_, _dined_, _raised_, _tired_, and
_prepared._ In _voted, quoted,_ and _translated,_ the suffix _–ed_ is pronounced /ed/
and adds an additional syllable.

|Root Word|–ed|–ing|
|---|---|---|
|smile|smiled|smiling|
|rake|raked|raking|
|fle|fled|fling|
|vote|voted|voting|
|dine|dined|dining|

|prepare|prepared|preparing|
|**Challenge Word:**does<br>**Challenge Word:**done|**Challenge Word:**does<br>**Challenge Word:**done|**Challenge Word:**does<br>**Challenge Word:**done|



  - Explain that Challenge Words are words that are used very often. They may
not follow spelling patterns and need to be memorized.


  - Tell students that they will need to know how to spell these words as they
will be included in their spelling assessment. Say each word using correct

pronunciation: _does_ —/dәz/ and _done_ —/dәn/. Use the Challenge Words in
sentences as examples for students: “An amphibian does not eat or move
when it is hibernating.” “The cookies are _done_ .”


Check for Understanding


Pair students off and tell them that you will say _does_ or _done_, and tey will
write the word on a piece of paper. After they write it down, they will share
it with a partner. Partners will discuss the correct spelling and then share
out. Do this for both words.


                 - Tell students that they will share this week’s spelling words on Activity
Page 6.6 with a family member at home.


**• Note:** Distribute the decodable passage, “Rattenborough and Frieda”, that
you prepared in advance to practice decoding words with sufixes _–ing_ and
_–ed_ . Remind students that the passage has root words with _–ed_ and _–ing_ .
Have students read in partner pairs. While students read, circulate and
provide informative feedback regarding fluency.

**Grade 3 | Unit 2**
##### Pausing Point 1


Note to Teacher


This is approximately the halfway point of the Animal Classification unit.
Students have studied various aspects of animal classification, including
the differences between vertebrates and invertebrates and between
warm- and cold-blooded animals. Students have learned so far about fish
and amphibians. It is recommended that you pause here and spend a day
reviewing, reinforcing, or extending the material taught so far.


You may do any of the activities you choose in any order or combination,
using whole class or small groups to meet the needs of the students.


**Core Content Up to this Pausing Point**


Students have:


  - observed and described basic characteristics of zoo animals


  - used text features to identify information about classifying animals


  - identified the connection between vertebrates and invertebrates


  - identified the characteristics of warm- and cold-blooded animals


  - described the characteristics of fish


  - described the characteristics of amphibians


  - sequenced the stages of metamorphosis


  - compared and contrasted two types of frogs


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


  - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _classification_ .

Have them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear
the word, such as the terms _warm-blooded/cold-blooded, vertebrate/_
_invertebrate, animal group, characteristics, features_, etc. Record student
responses on a piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard
for reference.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Poetry Reading**

  - Tell students that they are going to hear a poem titled “The Crocodile”
written by Lewis Carroll.


  - Tell students that Lewis Carroll is also the author of the fantasy stories _Alice’s_
_Adventures in Wonderland_ and _Through the Looking-Glass._


  - Tell students to listen for describing words, or adjectives, as you read the poem
aloud. What parts of the crocodile does Carroll describe? What adverbs does
he use to describe the crocodile’s actions? Do these descriptions use the kind
of words we would usually think of when we think of a crocodile? ~~**TEKS 3.10.D**~~


  - Tell students you are going to slowly re-read the poem aloud. Ask students to
write down any rhyming words they hear. How many pairs of rhyming words
can they list? Do the poem’s rhyming words have a pattern? ~~**TEKS 3.9.B**~~


**The Crocodile**


**by Lewis Carroll**


_How doth the little crocodile_


_Improve his shining tail,_


_And pour the waters of the Nile_


_On every golden scale!_


_How cheerfully he seems to grin!_


_How neatly spreads his claws,_


_And welcomes little fishes in_


_With gently smiling jaws!_


  - After reading the poem, ask students to share a characteristic about the
crocodile that they heard in the poem. Ask them to remember the describing
words, or adjectives, that Lewis Carroll uses to create an image of the
crocodile in its habitat.


**TEKS 3.10.D** Describe how the author’s use of imagery, literal and figurative language such as simile, and sound devices such
as onomatopoeia achieves specific purposes; **TEKS 3.9.B** Explain rhyme scheme, sound devices, and structural elements
such as stanzas in a variety of poems.


Pausing Point Animal Classification
**177**


**178**




  - Point out that adverbs such as _cheerfully_, _neatly_, and _gently_ create a funny
contrast with what the crocodile is actually doing.


  - Have students share what they noticed about the poem’s rhyme scheme
(ABAB). Guide them to recognize that this creates a cheerful singsong
feeling. It contrasts humorously with the real meaning of the poem, which is
that the crocodile is a dangerous predator.


  - Reread the poem and ask students to think about how the poem’s imagery
presents the crocodile. Is he shown as ferocious or beautiful? Is he
frightening or kind? As time permits, you may wish to have some students
create a drawing of this poem and caption it. Have them share their drawings
and captions.

**Poetry Writing** ~~**TEKS 3.12.A**~~

  - Using the poem “The Crocodile” as a model, have students create their own
poems about an animal or animal group.

**Collaborative Drawing**


Materials: Animal Foldable (Activity Page 3.2) drawing paper, drawing tools
_Rattenborough’s Guide to Animals_


**Note:** This activity works well as a small group activity while students are

working independently on research. You may need to assist students with

passing the drawing paper so that each drawing remains facedown. You may

wish to post the completed drawings on your classroom bulletin board.


  - In advance, fold sheets of drawing paper into thirds. Students will be working
in groups of three. Tell students they will be drawing animals from the
reading and Read-Aloud. Tell students they may refer to their Animal Foldable
(Activity Page 3.2) and their Reader to help them with ideas, and that they
may choose an animal that has not yet been entered in detail on the Animal
Foldable. The most important direction for this activity is that students
may not tell the other members of their group what they are drawing. They
must include characteristics of the animal group they are choosing. For
instance, if someone chooses an animal in the fish group, the drawing would
need to include scales and gills. The first student in each trio will have the
assignment of drawing the head of any animal that is classified in one of the
five vertebrate animal groups, and s/he will use just the first folded third of
the paper.


  - When this is complete, the first student will pass the drawing to the second
student, being sure to keep the head of the animal face down. The second
student in each trio will draw the middle section of a body of an animal of
his/her choosing that is classified in one of the five vertebrate groups. The


**TEKS 3.12.A** Compose literary texts, including personal narratives and poetry, using genre characteristics and craft.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


second student will use the middle third of piece of paper. Tell students that
this is not intended to be the same animal that the first student has drawn,
and remind them that there is to be no discussion of what anyone draws.
When the second student is finished, s/he will pass the drawing to the third
student. The third student in each trio will draw the lower half of an animal’s
body (e.g., legs, tail, etc.) on the lower third of the drawing paper.


  - After the third student in each trio has completed the final part, students
may open up the folded paper to see what they have created!


  - Last, each trio will collaborate to come up with a fitting name for the animal
they have created.

**Vertebrates**


Materials: Bone models; bone images


  - Show students bone models or pictures of the skeletons of humans and
other animals to illustrate the term _vertebrate_ . You may wish to also review
the word _vertebrae_ as the name for the bones that make up the backbones
of vertebrates. Help students find the backbone (vertebrae) in each model/
image and to feel their own vertebrae.

**Raise Your Hand If . . .**

 - Tell students that they are going to play a game called “Raise Your Hand If . . . ”
Explain that you will begin with the phrase, “Raise your hand if,” and then you
will add a second phrase about the characteristics of fish. Tell students to raise
their hands if the statement is a true statement regarding the classification
of fish. Clarify that the characteristics discussed will describe the majority of
the animals in this group, and that rare exceptions will not be included.


1. Fish are warm-blooded.


2. Fish have backbones. (Raise hands.)


3. The ecosystems fish live in are aquatic. (Raise hands.)


4. Fish breathe oxygen in water using gills. (Raise hands.)


5. Fish have feathers.

6. Amphibians go through a transformation called metamorphosis.
(Raise hands.)


7. The word _amphibian_ means “living two lives.” (Raise hands.)


**Classroom Fish**


Materials: Fish tank; aged tap water; small fish; fish food; turkey baster or
air pump


 - You may wish to prepare a tank as an aquarium so that students may closely
study fish. Age tap water by letting it sit out for twenty-four hours. Add
goldfish or other small fish from a pet store. If there is no air pump in the
tank, squeeze a turkey baster into the water a few times every couple of days
to oxygenate the water for the fish. Add fish food as directed on the package.
Allow students to study and take notes on the fish. Be sure to point out key
characteristics such as gills, fins, and scales.


**• Note:** Be sure to research the requirements of the fish selected to ensure
ethical and humane treatment.

**Animal Groups Bulletin Board**


Materials: Bulletin board; drawing paper; drawing tools; magazines


 - Tell the class or a group of students that together they are going to make
an Animal Groups bulletin board to help them remember what they have
learned thus far in this unit. Have students brainstorm important information
about the groups of animals they have learned. Have each student choose
one idea to draw a picture of, and ask him or her to write a caption for the
picture. Divide the bulletin board into five sections, one section for each
animal group. Post students’ drawings in the categories they describe.
( _Cold-blooded_ would go in the “Fish, Amphibians, or Reptiles” section, for
example.) You may want to have more than one student draw/write about
each concept.


 - Then have students bring in images or cut out images of animals from each
of the groups and post those onto the bulletin board as well. Tell students
that they will continue to add to this bulletin board as they learn more about
animal groups.

**Riddles for Core Content**

 - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:

~~**INDEPENDENT CENTERS**~~


  - During this Pausing Point, centers may be set up for student rotation. This
time will allow students to work independently while a small, needs-based
group can be taught. Literacy centers provide students of all abilities time
to work together. Centers can be located anywhere in your classroom. You
can put them on top of a bookshelf, on the seat of a chair, or on a desk.
Be sure to introduce all the centers before students begin the rotation.

**Universal Access**


In this lesson, students will practice determining the meaning of
unknown words.


 - Ask students what they do when they come across an unknown word while
reading. Write the strategies that students state on the board. If students do
not share strategies readily, prompt discussion with these questions:


   - When you find an unknown word in the text, what do you do? Do you
keep reading?


   - Do you ask the teacher or a parent what the word means?


   - Do you ask your classmate what the word means?


   - Do you look up the word in the dictionary?


   - Write a list of strategies on the board.


 - Tell students that today we will learn how to use context clues and make
predictions so that we can figure out the meaning of unknown words.


   - Ask students if they know how to make a prediction. Where can you find
a clue in the text when you are reading? If they do not know, prompt with
these answers: Find words you know. Look at other words in the sentence.
Look at words near the unknown word to give you clues. Break down the
word into root words.

2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Sea turtles have oar-shaped flippers for
moving through water effectively.”


3. When something is accomplished effectively, it means that it is well done
with purpose and success.


4. “There was no way for the principal to effectively get his message to the
entire school while the public address system was broken.”


5. Think of a time when you either did something effectively or you observed
something being done effectively. Be sure to use the word _effectively_ when
you tell about it. Have students engage in the think-pair-share routine to
discuss a time when they either did something or observed something
being done effectively. Have partners then share with the whole group
what they heard their partner say. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the
students’ responses to make complete sentences: “One time I did something
effectively was ____.”

~~**INTRODUCING PREFIXES RE– AND PRE– (15 MIN.)**~~


**Prefixes re– and pre–**

  - Review the Prefix poster that you displayed in the classroom.


A prefix is a word part placed in front of a root word. Prefixes change the
meaning of the root word.


  - Emphasize again that prefixes are added to the beginning of a root word.
They change the meaning of the root word, and they add a syllable to the
root word.


  - Tell students that the two prefixes that they will study this week are _re–_
and _pre–_ .


  - Explain that _re–_ means “to do again” and _pre–_ means “before.”


  - Tell students that this week’s root words are verbs. Ask students what verbs
are (action words). When _re–_ and _pre–_ are added to verbs, the new words are
also verbs.


  - Write the word _write_ in cursive on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning of
the word and then use it in a sentence. (to make letters, words, or numbers
or to create something to be Read (e.g., “Mom asked me to write ‘green
peppers’ on her grocery list.”)


  - Add the prefix _re–_ to write and have students read the prefix, read the new
word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word.


» to make letters, words, or numbers again or to create something to be read again


  - Ask students for examples of things that they might rewrite.


» Answers may vary but could include homework, something with sloppy

handwriting, a paper with edits, etc.


  - Continue in this manner for the remaining _re–_ words, using the following
chart as a guide.


**Note:** You will not write the information in the shaded columns on the board

as that information is intended for use during oral instruction.

African ecosystem with Ebenezer Egret


Hello, folks. It’s me, Rattenborough

once again. If you recall, you learned

all about reptiles last time. How

exciting that was! Can you remember

which group of animals you are going

to hear about today?


Birds! I can’t wait to tell you all about my friend Ebenezer. I met him

on the continent of Africa. Before I tell you about him, I thought we

would begin today’s lesson by quickly reviewing how Paolo, Tabitha,

and Anna are related to each other. Remember, just because they

don’t look the same, they do have quite a bit in common, beginning

with the fact that they are all members of the animal kingdom.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification



**226**


**Show Image U2.L10.2**
Three animal skeletons


I brought along special diagrams of

their skeletons to help you. Can you

tell which skeleton belongs to each

animal? What common characteristic

is visible in all three? Yes, all three of them have backbones, so as you

probably recall, scientists classify them as . . . yes—vertebrates!


We’re not going to spend much time talking about their internal

body temperatures today. By now you should know that none of

them have constant body temperatures. Paolo, Tabitha, and Anna

are all cold-blooded and their temperature changes depending on

their surroundings. That makes two characteristics that all three of

them hold in common: the fact that they are all vertebrates, and the

fact that they are all cold-blooded animals. So, now let’s see where

Ebenezer Egret fits in. We know that he belongs to the animal group

classified as birds. Let’s confirm it: Are birds vertebrates?


**Show Image U2.L10.3**
Anatomy of a bird


Indeed they are. Ebenezer has a

strong backbone that reaches all the

way up his long neck and supports

his head. His bony skeleton is very

important. His bones are extremely light with lots of air cavities, or

hollow places, inside them to help him fly. He uses his muscular legs

to push off the ground, and then his wings take over. The weight and

arrangement of his bones help him soar through the air.


  - **Vocab Pause:** Whole group. Write the following sentence on the board:


    - “Their bones are extremely light with lots of air cavities, or hollow places,
inside them to help them fly.”


Lesson 10 Wings and Feathers, Part 1
**227**


**228**




  - Ask students to define _cavities_ . Explain that the definition of _cavities_ is in
the sentence. Circle the commas in the sentence and explain that after the
vocabulary word _cavities_ the definition is given.


- **Bird Bone Experiment:** Review with students that birds have strong, hollow
bones very similar to straws. Show the class the table created out of straws
and a paper plate.


  - Ask students “How many pennies do you think this table will hold?” Have

Egrets and Ebenezer in flight


Birds are the lucky ones, aren’t they?

How many of you have ever wished

that you could fly? I do like very much

being a rat, but sometimes I think it

would be great fun to fly. Ebenezer is

very graceful, isn’t he? So far you have learned in detail just about

cold-blooded animals—reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Do you think

Ebenezer and all birds are cold-blooded, too? Scientists classify birds

as warm-blooded, because their internal body temperature remains

constant no matter where they fly.


Egrets


Birds have several characteristics

that enable them to fly, but being

warm-blooded is essential to flight.

They have a very high metabolism

as only warm-blooded animals do.

Metabolism is the process that changes food into energy in most

animals’ bodies. When we speak about the high metabolism of birds,

we are speaking about the fact that they have a steady flow of energy


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


that helps them maintain the high levels of activity required by flight.

The higher the activity level of an animal, the higher its metabolism

is likely to be. What this means when it comes to eating is that they

need lots of food to maintain that energy.


Have you ever heard the saying “eats like a bird” for someone who

eats very small amounts of food at one time? Ebenezer told me that

an important thing to remember about this expression is that it does

not mean that birds do not eat very much. In fact, Ebenezer and

birds like him need to eat two times their body weight in food every

day, because they have such a high metabolism and burn lots more

energy than most animals. Of course, there are lots of small meals a

day for birds, quite unlike Anna Anaconda who sometimes eats only

one big meal in a period of many days. So, someone who “eats like a

bird” is usually someone who “picks” at their food and only eats small

bits at a time.


- **Vocabulary Pause:** Write the following sentence on the board:


  - “They have a very high metabolism as only warm-blooded animals do.
Metabolism is the process that changes food into energy in most
animals’ bodies.”


- Ask students to define _metabolism_ . Explain that this sentence is an example
of looking for the definition after the vocabulary word.


- **Bald Eagle Wingspan:** Show students the poster of the bald eagle’s
wingspan. Explain that the wingspan of a bald eagle is seven to nine feet.


- Pass out white rectangle paper to each student. In pairs, have one student
lay down with their back on the paper as the other student traces their
wingspan. With a tape measure, each student will measure their own wingspan.

So, like all birds, Ebenezer is

warm-blooded. And he’s a vertebrate

with lightweight bones to help him fly.

other physical characteristics that help scientists classify Ebenezer

as a bird. Good eyes, boys and girls.


Let’s begin with his wings. Ebenezer has wings, and wings are

essential to flight. The shape of a bird’s wings determines how far and

high a bird can fly, in addition to its lightweight bones.


**Show Image U2.L10.7**
American bald eagle and hummingbird


Look at this picture of an American

bald eagle. His long, broad wings are

built so that he can glide, or move

smoothly and continuously. He can

soar great distances, traveling up to 65 miles per hour. Compare the

eagle’s wings to the tiny, tapered wings of the hummingbird, one of

the smallest birds on Earth. His wings beat rapidly, twenty or more

beats per second, as he hovers, or floats and flutters, in midair.


**Show Image U2.L10.8**
Bird feathers


What else helps Ebenezer and all

birds fly? Feathers are a great help,

serving as lightweight coverings for

their wings. They mesh together as

their wings flap downward, parting again to let air through as their

wings sweep upward. Feathers also act as **insulation.** Insulation is

an extra layer that protects birds’ skin from the sun and traps in heat,

providing energy and warmth in the winter months. The point of the

feather where it is attached to a bird’s body is called the quill. All

birds have feathers. No other animals do, so if you spot a feathered

friend, you may assume that it’s a bird. Because their precious

feathers take quite a beating, birds take good care of them, and often

preen them with their beaks to keep them clean, waterproof, and in

the right position.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Show Image U2.L10.9**
Ebenezer’s beak, a finch’s beak, and
other bird beaks


Take a look at Ebenezer’s beak. Isn’t

it a beauty? Not all birds have such

long beaks. Why do you think his is

so long? Well, I’ll tell you. He told me it’s a terrific hunting weapon.

He uses the end of his beak to grab small prey such as snails and

crayfish in the surface waters of the marshland and to spear larger

prey such as frogs and snakes on marshy wetlands.


Appearing in many different shapes and sizes, beaks are often used

to identify birds. Their main function is for feeding, so a bird’s beak

can provide scientists with clues to a bird’s eating habits. Take a look

at this finch’s beak. Depending upon where you live, you may have

seen a finch at your bird feeder. They use their beaks to crack open

seeds. Next time you see a bird, look at its beak and see if you can

guess whether it eats fish, seeds, insects, mice, or nectar.


  - **Vocabulary Pause:** Write the following sentences on the board:


    - “Feathers also act as insulation. Insulation is an extra layer that protects
birds’ skin from the sun and traps in heat, providing energy and warmth in
the winter months.”


    - Explain to students that you will give them three possible definitions
for _insulation_ . When they hear the correct definition, students will raise
their hand.


    - Definition of _insulation_ :


    - move smoothly


    - mesh together


     - an extra layer

Check for Understanding


If students failed to identify the correct definition for _insulation,_ review
the sentences on the board, highlighting the sentence that follows the
vocabulary word as the definition.


**Show Image U2.L10.10**
Bird feet


Birds’ feet are another clue to

different bird habitats and lifestyles.

Hawks have long talons, or claws, to

catch their prey; waders have long

legs; woodpeckers have feet adapted to climbing trees; perching

birds have single hind, or rear, toes for grasping branches; and ducks

and geese have webbed feet for swimming.


- **Birds’ Feet:** In small groups, pass out a set of the bird feet cards. Have
students predict the characteristics of the birds based on their feet. Have
groups share their predictions and explanations with the class.


**Show Image U2.L10.11**
Bird nests


Birds are the only group of animals

that give birth by only one means—

there are fascinating pattern-breakers

in all of the other groups. All birds

lay eggs. Their eggs are yolk-filled and have hard, calcified shells.

They need to be incubated, or kept warm, so the parents sit on them

until they hatch. This can be dangerous because sitting birds are

prime targets for predators. Most birds prepare a **nest,** or shelter

for their young, using whatever materials are available to them in

nature. Some make nests from twigs and straw; others build nests

of mud; woodpeckers create cavities in trees, whereas kingfishers

bore into riverbanks. These nests provide safe havens, or safe places,


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


protecting both eggs and baby chicks from harsh weather and

animal predators.


Some birds, like chickens, are able to see, walk, and feed themselves

almost immediately after hatching. However, many birds are born in a

very immature stage and require a lengthy period of parental care.


**Show Image U2.L10.12**
Ostrich, emu, and penguin


We spent lots of time today talking

about what helps birds fly—strong

muscles, light bones, powerful wings,

and airy feathers. But did you know

that in spite of having all those things in common, some birds are

unable to fly? Flightless birds include the largest bird on Earth, the

ostrich. With a seven-foot wingspan, it seems odd that ostriches can’t

fly, but they hold records for being both the fastest birds on land and

the fastest two-legged animals on Earth, able to run up to 40 miles

per hour! Australian emus [ _ee_ -myoos], also large and flightless,

look a lot like ostriches and often travel long distances to find food.

Penguins are perhaps the most endearing, or affection-inspiring, of

all flightless birds, marching upright like people as they move around

in their habitats. These aquatic birds of the Southern Hemisphere

waddle along on their short legs and webbed feet down to the sea.

Their wings serve as flippers to carry them swiftly through arctic

waters, traveling up to 15 miles per hour.


**Show Image U2.L10.13**
Birds in different ecosystems


Birds live all over the world—in cool,

wet rainforests; along ocean shores;

in dark, dense evergreens; in hot, dry

deserts; and on the banks of lakes,

rivers, and streams. Some travel long distances, migrating to warmer

homes in winter, whereas others are homebodies, never straying very

far from where they were born. Some can swim and others can fly.

Some enchant us with their songs, whereas others shout, “Caw-caw!”

Birds come in all different shapes and sizes, but all birds are

warm-blooded, egg-laying vertebrates with feathers and wings.


Birds are very different from the animals we will study next time. So

far, you’ve learned about fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. What

do you suppose is next? I’ll give you a hint. They’re hairy and warm

 - Students are likely to make the error of not dropping the final ‘e’ prior to
adding one of the endings.


 - While the above student-error scenario may occur, you should still be aware
that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to
record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.
For example: Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels?
Which ones?


   - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?


   - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


   - Is the student consistently making errors on particular
beginning consonants?


   - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


   - Also, examine the dictated sentence for errors in capitalization
and punctuation.

**Step 1: Introducing the Root Words**

 - Tell students they will be assessed on these words. On the assessment, they
will be responsible for spelling these root words, in addition to other words
that follow the pattern of the words studied. This week, students will be
responsible for spelling the root words plus the forms of these words when
the suffix _–es_ is added.


 - Explain that some of the spelling words this week are verbs and some are
nouns when the _–es_ is added. Review that a noun is a part of speech that
names a person, place or thing. A verb shows action or being.


 - Have the spelling words written in cursive on the table in advance.


 - Model the syllable division routine with 2–3 words. Then, have students
come up and decode words applying the syllable division rule and telling the
teacher the vowel sounds in each syllable in the words they decode.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


  - Write _puppy_ in the table. Underline the vowel letters in the word like this:

    - puppy


  - “How many consonant letters are between the two vowel letters?” (two)


  - Remind students that when there are two consonant letters between two
vowel letters, the word is divided between the two consonants.


  - Draw a line between the letters ‘p’ and ‘p’ like this:

    - pup | py


  - Cover the second syllable, ‘py’, and tell students that if the word is divided in
this way, you would read this first syllable as /pup/, since syllables ending
with consonants are generally pronounced with the short vowel sound.


  - Then, cover the first syllable, ‘pup’, and ask students to read the last syllable,
/pee/, reminding them, if necessary, that the letter ‘y’ can stand for the
/ee/ sound, especially at the end of words. Prompt students in blending and
saying the word, /pup/ /pee/.


  - Now, ask students to read each syllable of the word as segments. (Students
should say /pup pee/.)


  - Now, tell students to “read it fast.” This means students should read the two
syllables quickly enough to blend and say the word.


  - Tell students that they can now easily see the parts of the word and it is
easier to decode and spell.


  - Write the following words in cursive on the table: _penny, carry, butter, bunny,_
_hurry,_ and _marry._


  - Model the syllable division routine with two of the words. Then, have students
come up and decode the other words applying the syllable division rule and
telling the teacher the vowel sounds in each syllable in the words they decode.


    - pen | ny


    - car | ry


    - but | ter


    - bun | ny


    - hur | ry


    - mar | ry


  - After writing _study_ in the table, ask students to tell you the vowel sounds in
the word. Underline the vowel letters in the word like this:

    - study


  - “How many consonant letters are between the two vowel letters?” (one)


Lesson 11 Wings and Feathers, Part 2
**245**


**246**




 - Remind students that when there is one consonant letter between two vowel
letters, the word can be divided before or after that single consonant.


 - Tell students that you will divide the word into syllables with the division
coming after the vowel. Draw a line between the letters ‘u’ and ‘d’ like this:

   - stu | dy


 - Cover the second syllable, ‘dy’, and tell students that if the word is divided in
this way, you would read this first syllable as /stue/, even though syllables
ending with vowels are generally pronounced with the long vowel sound.


 - Then, cover the first syllable, ‘stu’, and ask students to read the last syllable,
/dee/.


 - Prompt students in blending and saying the word, /stue dee/, and point out
this does not sound like an English word that you recognize.


 - Tell students that you will try dividing the word into syllables with the division
coming after the consonant. Draw a line between the letters ‘d’ and ‘y’ like this:

   - stud | y


 - Then, cover the second syllable, ‘y’, and ask students to read the first part of
the word, /stud/.


 - Cover the first syllable, ‘stud’, and ask students to read the second part of the
word, /ee/.


 - Now, ask students to read each syllable of the word as segments. (Students
should say /stud ee/.)


 - Now, tell students to “read it fast.” This means that students should read the
two syllables quickly enough to blend and say the word.

**Step 2: Adding the Suffix –es to the Root Words**

 - Tell students that you will not complete the remainder of the table by adding
the suffix – _es_ to each root word. Model applying the spelling rule when
adding suffix - _es_ with 1–2 words.


 - Point out the Suffix poster and read it with students.


   - A _suffix_ is a syllable placed after a root word. Suffixes change the meaning
of the root word.


 - Ask what the suffix – _es_ signals for verbs. (ongoing action that is
still happening)


 - Ask what the suffix _–es_ signals for nouns. (plural forms of the noun, more
than one)


 - Tell students that before adding the suffix _–es_ to a word ending in ‘y’, they
must change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ for each root word. Working with each root word,
change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and then add the suffix _–es_ .


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


 - Have students practice a few words with a partner prior to having students
apply the rule to the spelling words independently on Activity Page 11.4.

 - Introduce the Challenge Words, using correct pronunciation. Use the
Challenge Words in sentences as examples for students: “We can collect
leaves _along_ the way.” “Mom asked me to _put_ four plates on the table
for dinner.”


**• Note:** Distribute the decodable passage, “All About Woodpeckers”, that you
prepared in advance to practice decoding words with the suffixes _-es_ . Read the
first paragraph of the decodable passage to the class to model fluent reading.
Have students apply decoding strategies to the decodable passage by reading
in partners or groups of three to practice fluent reading. As students read,
circulate and offer immediate, informative feedback to students.

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U2.L12.1**
African ecosystem with Hilda Hippo


Well, boys and girls, it’s me,

Rattenborough, back again! Today

we’re going to talk about a group

of animals that you already know a

little something about—based on your own personal experience.

Hilda Hippo is one of these, and I am one of these. Remember our

mnemonic? **A** ll **M** y **B** est **F** riends **R** epresent Vertebrates! Yes, the

letter ‘M’ in the word _My_ stands for mammals! And guess what? You

are mammals, too!


Who can name some characteristics of mammals? In what ways are

you like Hilda and me? What keen observations you make! Yes, we are

warm-blooded vertebrates with hair. I think _you_ could help _me_ teach

this lesson.


Let’s begin with the name of this group: mammals. It comes from

the Latin word _mammalia_ . The word _mammalia_ refers to a group

of animals who possess **mammary glands.** Mammary glands are

milk-producing organs belonging to female mammals. When female

mammals give birth, they secrete a nourishing substance—milk—

to feed their young. That is one of the primary characteristics of

mammals: We feed our young milk. That’s right—rats drink mother’s

milk, hippopotami drink mother’s milk, and so do humans! The

mother’s milk has all the nourishment that a baby needs.


Mammals have backbones! Reach around and check out your back

once more to make sure your backbone is still there! Of course it is.

Without backbones, we wouldn’t be able to sit up straight or hold our

heads in the air. And our spinal cords that house the nerves that send

messages to our brains would be unprotected! So, because we all

have backbones, scientists call us . . . what? Yes, quite right—we are

all vertebrates.

Turtles and horses


Reptiles, amphibians, and fish all

have a relatively low metabolism and,

as you have learned, are classified

as cold-blooded animals. Like birds,

mammals, such as this horse, have a high metabolism, burning lots of

energy to help them maintain a constant internal body temperature.

What is the term that taxonomists use to classify mammals in terms

of body temperature? Yes, we are all warm-blooded.


 - Text Structure: Write the following sentence on the board:


   - Like birds, mammals, such as this horse, have a high metabolism. Circle
the word _like_ in the sentence and explain how this word is used to compare
birds to mammals.


   - The author of our text uses this structure to organize their writing and
show similarities and differences between animals. This helps the reader
understand key ideas and details about these animals.

One of you was right when you

said that mammals are covered in

hair or fur. Some of us are hairier

than others. Hilda Hippo and other



hippopotamuses don’t look so hairy, do they? But you might

remember that they do have a little bit of hair around their mouths

and on the tips of their ears and tails. Let’s take a look at a few of our

furrier friends.

leaves and to see into the distance.

I’ll bet that if I were as tall as a giraffe, I could spot my enemies

more quickly.

them take great leaps, gliding through the air with the help of their

tails for steering. The only mammals that can truly fly are bats. They

have skin between their long fingers that stretches out, turning their

arms into wings when they open. Bats may seem like birds; however,

they are not because they have no feathers—they actually have a fine

fur—and they give birth to live young.


- Text Structure: Write the following sentence on the board:


  - Bats may seem like birds; however, they are not because they have
no feathers.


  - Circle the word _however_ in the sentence and explain how this word is used
to contrast bats and birds.

Various mammals


Most, but not all, mammals are

**terrestrial,** meaning that they live on

land. Can anyone think of an aquatic

mammal, a mammal that lives in

water? I’ll give you a hint. One of them

is my friend—Hilda!


**Show Image U2.L12.8**
Hippopotamus in water


Ah, yes. Hippopotami love the water.

But they are actually semiaquatic,

meaning that they live partly in water

and partly on land. Usually, Hilda and

other hippopotami stand in the water during the day to keep cool.

Then they graze on land when evening falls.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Show Image U2.L12.9**
Aquatic and semiaquatic mammals


Whales are **marine** mammals, meaning

that they live in the ocean. The blue

whale is not only the largest mammal,

but it is also the largest animal on

Earth. Blue whales can grow up to one hundred feet long; that’s a

little longer than a basketball court! Its tongue alone weighs more

than three tons! Imagine that! Manatees and smaller whales such as

dolphins and porpoises are also fully aquatic, marine mammals. They

share saltwater seas with walruses and seals, semiaquatic animals

that like to wander on shore just like Hilda Hippo does.


Marine mammals share many of the same characteristics as land

mammals. They are warm-blooded, they have backbones and fur or

hair—even though sometimes it is the tiniest amount of hair—and they

breathe oxygen from the air. Remember when we talked about how

fish use gills to breathe in oxygen from the water? Remember how in

amphibians those gills develop into lungs, requiring amphibians to

come to the surface of the water to breathe air? Well, mammals also

have lungs. All mammals have lungs and an underlying **diaphragm**

that assists breathing. When the diaphragm tightens, it creates more

space in the lung cavity, and air is drawn into the lungs. All mammals,

including whales and porpoises, dolphins and manatees, must come to

the surface of the water now and then to breathe.


**Show Image U2.L12.10**
Capybara, beaver, and duck-billed
platypus


Some mammals also live in fresh water.

I want to introduce you to another

semiaquatic relative of mine. This is a

capybara [kappy-barrah]. He, like me, is classified as a rodent and likes to

swim.


Lesson 12 Live-Bearing Milk Producers
**265**


Challenge


Have students identify
sentences that compare
and contrast without
clue words.


**266**




- Text Structure: Write the following sentence on the board and pass out one
sticky note to each student.


  - He, like me, is classified as a rodent and likes to swim.


  - On the sticky note, have students list the text structure key word and
write _compare_ or _contrast_ to signal what is happening in the sentence.
( _like_, _compare_ )


  - With a partner, have students share their sticky note response.


  - Have students place their sticky notes on the board under the sentence.


Check for Understanding


Quickly review the sticky notes on the board. If students did not recognize
the _like_ and _compare,_ review with students the clue word in the sentence.


The duck-billed platypus is unusual. It is one of only a few mammals

that lay eggs. Spiny anteaters, also natives of Australia and nearby

islands, are the only other egg-laying mammals. All other mammals

are live-bearing, which means they give birth to live young. The young

are nourished inside the mother’s body, and most are fully developed

when they are born, looking like smaller versions of their parents. A

few, like kangaroos and opossums, are part of a group of mammals

called marsupials. Marsupial babies are very underdeveloped when

they are born, but they move directly to the mother’s protective

pouch to be nourished by her milk. All mammals, whether hatched

from eggs or born live, feed on the mother’s milk in their **infancy.**


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Show Image U2.L12.11**
Wolf and deer with respective skeletons


Remember learning that birds’ beaks

may provide clues to their diets? The

same is true of mammals’ mouths.

Wide mouths and sharp, pointed teeth

suggest that these mammals may be carnivores. Wolves, whales, and

bats are all carnivores. Herbivores are more likely to have long jaws,

long tongues, and flat teeth. Deer, sheep, and pandas are all herbivores.

Omnivorous mammals include bears, opossums, chipmunks, and mice.

All humans are omnivores, but humans _think_ about the choices they

make about what to eat. Omnivores generally have sharper front teeth

and flat teeth for chewing in the back of their mouths. Think about your

mouth. Even though humans can think and make choices about what to

eat, based on your teeth, do you think humans should be classified as

carnivores, herbivores, or omnivores? Why?


Next time, we’ll look at the last of my slides. Be ready for a review of the

five vertebrate groups of the animal kingdom—amphibians, mammals,

birds, fish, and reptiles. I’m sure you are becoming quite skilled at

classifying animals, and we’ll get to have some fun with doing just that.


Can’t wait—see you soon!


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (15 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** How would you describe the body covering of a mammal?


» It is covered with hair or fur.


2. How does the fur on a yak and on other animals help them?


» It keeps them warm.


3. **Evaluative.** Compare and contrast mammals and birds.


» Both are warm-blooded vertebrates; however, mammals have fur or hair, whereas

birds have feathers; mammals give birth to live babies, whereas baby birds hatch

from eggs; and mammals have mammary glands, which birds do not.


4. **Turn and Talk:** Explain to a partner how a compare and contrast text

structure contributes to the author’s purpose.

If students have difficulty identifying the text structure clue words, review
the Text Structures chart in small groups and circle the clue words in
each sentence.


~~**WORD WORK: STATELY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _stately_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. If
necessary, review syllable patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard Rattenborough describing a giraffe and saying,
“I love his stately long neck . . .”


3. When something is stately, it is grand or impressive in size or manner.


4. The stately marching band at my brother’s high school football game made
the game feel very important.


5. Have you ever witnessed anything that was stately? What was it and where
were you? Be sure to use the word _stately_ when you tell about it. Ask two or
three students to answer the question. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
the students’ responses to be complete sentences: “When my mom dressed
up to go out to a fancy dinner, her stately appearance .”


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _stately_ ?


7. Use a Complete Sentences activity for follow-up. Ask students, “What does
_stately_ mean?”


8. Now have a few volunteers form complete sentences that include the word
_stately,_ along with identifying an animal in one of the five vertebrate groups
that they think is stately (“I think a peacock is stately because .”). As
time allows, you may wish to allow students to create a list of synonyms for
_stately_ and/or draw a picture of a stately animal and share it with the class.


~~**SAYINGS AND PHRASES (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Proverbs are short, traditional sayings that have been passed along orally
from generation to generation. These sayings usually express general
truths based on experiences and observations of everyday life. Although


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


some proverbs do have literal meanings—that is, they mean exactly what
they say—many proverbs have a richer meaning beyond the literal level. It
is important to help your students understand the difference between the
literal meanings of the words and their implied or figurative meanings.


  - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone say, “The show must go on.”
Have students repeat the saying. Ask students to guess what this phrase
means. Explain that, literally, this saying means that it is necessary for a
show of some sort to continue. The implied or figurative meaning, however, is
that any project, event, or plan must be completed no matter what happens.


  - Explain that this saying, which was in use in the United States starting in
about 1867, likely originated with the popularity of the circus. Despite tragic
accidents, poor weather conditions, and other setbacks that might have
meant cancellation, circus shows usually took place as scheduled.


  - Ask students what Rattenborough began to think about during his slide
presentation today that caused him to get lost in a memory. Tell students
that it seemed for a moment that Rattenborough might go on and on about
his childhood, but he stopped himself. Ask students, “What did he say to get
back to the lesson?” (“The show must go on!”) He was implying that he’d
better get on with his plan—the slide show—because it had to be completed
today. Find other opportunities to use this saying in the classroom
throughout the year.

  - Tell students that they are going to choose an animal from one of the five
vertebrate groups that they learned about from the Read-Alouds and readings. Ask
them to say together out loud the mnemonic for remembering the five groups:
All My Best Friends Represent Vertebrates. Now ask them to say together out

Lesson 13 Jane Goodall
**287**


Activity Page 13.3




- Tell students that each of them is going to write an informational paragraph
about an animal and animal group of their choosing, and in the paragraph
they will explain why the animal is classified as it is.


- Write the word _informational_ on the board in cursive, and ask what word (or words)
students see inside that word. You may wish to underline or box in the word
_information_ and/or _inform._ Explain that informational writing relays information, or
facts, and informs the reader about a certain topic. For example, an informational
paragraph may explain how electricity works or why we have four seasons
in the Northern Hemisphere. Tell students that sometimes when writing an
informational paragraph, a writer may already know information, or facts, about
the chosen topic. Explain that many times, however, writers will need to research
several sources for information, including books, magazines, websites, etc.


- Tell students that they have collected a lot of information that is now
available to help them with this informational paragraph. Point out the many
helpful sources of information: the Animal Classification Foldable (Activity
Page 3.2), Brainstorming webs, and Field Journal responses.


- Remind students of the steps of the writing process—plan, draft, revise, edit,
and publish—and tell them that all of the notes they have collected along
with the Classification Foldable will provide the information they will need to
write their informational paragraph. Tell students that they will each write an
informational paragraph with guidance from you.


- Have students take out their copies of their Classification Foldable,
Brainstorming webs, and Field Journal responses. Guide them in looking over
the five Brainstorming webs and in deciding on which animal and animal
group they are each going to write about. Tell them that the Brainstorming
Graphic Organizer they choose will provide the information and the plan for
their paragraphs.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 13.3. Write these three steps in cursive
on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard. Tell students that once they
choose an animal, they will do the following:


1. Write a topic sentence.


2. W rite at least three supporting sentences from their sources to support
the topic sentence.


3. Write a concluding sentence.


- “Who can tell me what a topic sentence is?” Remind students that a topic
sentence is the first sentence in a paragraph that tells the reader the central
idea of that paragraph. In this case, the topic sentence will make a claim
about the chosen animal and how it is classified. Share this example with
students: “Frilled dragons, one of my favorite animals, are classified by
scientists as reptiles.”


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification



**288**


  - “What will the supporting sentences, or evidence, provide?” Guide students in
understanding that their supporting sentences will provide the reasons for their
topic sentence, or claim. This is the information they will research in their sources.
Share these example sentences with students. “First, frilled dragons are grouped
in the reptiles group because they are cold-blooded. Because frilled dragons do
not have a source of internal heat, like you and I do, they need a source of external
heat, such as the sun or a heat lamp. Another reason frilled dragons are in the
reptile group is that they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Reptiles are
also vertebrates, which is why they are grouped together into one group. Finally,
frilled dragons have scaly skin like other reptiles, instead of fur or feathers.” Point
out the use of transitional words, such as _first, another,_ and _finally._


  - “Who can tell me what a concluding sentence is?” Remind students that
this is the last sentence in the paragraph that wraps up, or concludes, the
information and often restates the topic sentence in another way. Tell students
that the concluding sentence lets the reader know that the writer is finished
with the central idea stated in the paragraph, and that it does not introduce
any new supporting information. Share this example with students: “These are
the reasons that frilled dragons are categorized as reptiles, and I hope to have
one of these awesome reptiles as a pet someday!”


  - Tell students that they will draft at least five sentences today, but they
may also wish to write additional sentences about their chosen animal,
such as descriptions of its habitat, eating habits, their thoughts about the
animal, and interesting facts, including which animals are pattern breakers
and why. Remind students that they will be able to use what they already
know to supply the reasons for the animal’s classification and any other
information they would like to include. You may also wish to allow students
to research further, using trade books in the classroom book tub, their Skills
Reader, and locally approved sources.


  - Encourage students to begin thinking of title ideas and any changes that they
think are needed in their paragraphs. Tell students that you will help them
revise, or make changes to, this piece during the next writing session.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


**Note:** You may wish to model this writing process completely for some

students; see the sample paragraph at the end of Lesson 9.

  - Review with students the section on Activity Page 3.2 that has been filled in
during previous lessons, discussing the characteristics of each vertebrate
group. If any spaces in the foldable are still empty, discuss with students
what information can be filled in.


  - Remind students that representatives of all five vertebrate groups, as well
as invertebrates, live in their community. There may be many animals that
students have seen in their neighborhoods, in nearby parks, or on trips to
other places near where they live.


  - Ask, “Who can think of an animal that lives in our community? How would you
classify this animal?” Ask students to share their thinking and decision-making
about how to classify the animals with questions such as “Why do you think
so?” and “What evidence do you have for classifying a squirrel as a mammal?”
Accept both vertebrate and invertebrate animals as part of this discussion.

**Lesson 14: “Scientists Who Classify Animals” and**

**“Vertebrates around the World”**
##### Writing



**Primary Focus:** Students will continue drafting an informative writing piece about

an animal’s characteristics and classification, clearly stating ideas, facts, and

details. ~~**[TEKS 3.11.B.ii; TEKS 3.11.C; TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


~~**REVISING AN INFORMATIONAL PARAGRAPH (45 MIN.)**~~


~~**TEKS 3.11.C; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


  - Have students gather their animal papers: animal foldable, animal webs, field
journal, and Activity Page 13.3.


  - Remind students that they have completed the planning and drafting
step of the writing process and that today they are going to complete the
revising step.


  - Have students reread their drafts. Tell students that they are going to use
a Revision Checklist (Activity Page 14.3) to help them to know what other
changes need to be made to the paragraph.


  - “Who can tell me what _revise_ means?” Remind students that the word _revise_
means “change” and is a sub-step of the drafting step. Remind students that
writers often revise many, many times before they are able to call their final
manuscript “finished.” Remind students that revising is somewhat different
from editing: revising often includes making changes to the content and/or
the order of the content, whereas editing often includes making corrections
to grammar, punctuation, and spelling according to the rules of Standard
English. Tell students that they will complete the editing step the next time
they meet to work on writing.


  - Read aloud Activity Page 14.3 to students. Have students look at their drafts
again and answer the questions on the Revision Checklist to see if there are
any necessary content revisions to be made to their paragraphs.


  - Explain that, with an informative paragraph, sometimes the sentences may be
rearranged to flow better. You may wish to write the supporting sentences onto
strips and move them around to see which order helps the paragraph flow best.


**TEKS 3.11.B.ii** Develop drafts into a focused, structured, and coherent piece of writing by developing an engaging idea with
relevant details; **TEKS 3.11.C** Revise drafts to improve sentence structure and word choice by adding, deleting, combining,
and rearranging ideas for coherence and clarity; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive
leaving appropriate space between words.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**• Check for Understanding** Explain how you revised your informative
paragraph. ~~**[ TEKS 3.11.C ]**~~


  - Once revisions have been decided upon, remind students that the last substep of the drafting step is to rewrite a second draft of their paragraphs,
incorporating the changes made during the revision sub-step. Have students
turn to Activity Page 14.4. As students rewrite their paragraphs, remind
them to use capital letters at the beginning of their sentences, appropriate
punctuation at the end, and commas between things in a series.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


  - Have students think more about a title. Tell them that they may wish to write
a title at the top of their second drafts, but that they may keep thinking
about other title ideas. Tell students that they will complete the next step
of the writing process—editing—the next time they meet to work on writing
together, and that they may decide on a final title then.


    - **“The Coolest Animal Group”**


Frilled dragons, one of my favorite animals, are classified by scientists
as reptiles. First, they are grouped in the reptiles group because they
are cold-blooded. Because frilled dragons do not have a source of
internal heat, like you and I do, they need a source of external heat, such
as the sun or a heat lamp. Another reason frilled dragons are in the
reptile group is that they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.
Reptiles are also vertebrates, which is why they are grouped together
into one group. Finally, frilled dragons have scaly skin like other reptiles,
instead of fur or feathers. These are the reasons that frilled dragons are
categorized as reptiles, and I hope to have one of these awesome reptiles
as a pet someday!


  - If time permits, have students present their informative writing pieces.

**Grade 3 | Unit 2**
##### Pausing Point 2


Note to Teacher


You have now completed the Animal Classification unit. Before completing
the end of unit assessment, it is recommended that you pause here and
spend a day reviewing, reinforcing, or extending the material taught.


You may do the activities in any order or combination, using whole class or
small groups to meet the needs of the students.


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


  - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _shed_ . Have
them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word,
such as _cast off, skin, grow, molt,_ etc. Record students’ responses on a piece
of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard for reference.

**Bird Study**


Materials: Books about local birds; bird feeder, bird food


  - You may wish to study some common local birds so that students recognize
the birds in their area. Then, you may wish to hang a bird feeder near a
classroom window so that students can observe this group of animals
feeding. Students may record their observations in a notebook.

**Animal Groups Bulletin Board**


Materials: Bulletin board; drawing paper, drawing materials; magazines


  - Tell the class or a group of students that together they are going to add to the
animal groups bulletin board they created earlier to help them remember what
they have learned in this unit. Have students brainstorm important information
about the groups of animals they have learned. Have each student choose one
idea to draw a picture of and ask him or her to write a caption for the picture.
Post students’ drawings in the categories they describe. (Warm-blooded would
go in the Mammals or Birds section, for example.) You may want to have more
than one student draw/write about each concept. Then, have students bring in
images or cut out images of animals from each of the groups and post those
onto the bulletin board as well.


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Venn Diagram**


Materials: Activity Page PP.5; chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


 - Tell students that together you are going to compare and contrast two things
or animals they have learned about by asking how they are similar and how
they are different. Use Activity Page PP.5 to list two items or animals at the
top of the diagram and to capture information provided by students. Choose
from the following list, or create a pair of your own:


   - insects and arachnids


   - amphibians and reptiles


   - birds and fish


   - mammals and humans


   - an object in the classroom and an organism outside the window


 - You may wish to prepare several copies of the Venn diagram to compare and
contrast several things or animals. You may also wish to have students use
these diagrams as brainstorming information for further writing.


 - You may wish to have some students use Activity Page PP.5 to complete this
activity independently.


 - You may wish to have some students create a three-way Venn diagram to
compare and contrast three things or animals (for example, carnivores,
omnivores, and herbivores; amphibians, reptiles, and birds; etc.).

**Create a Graphic**


Materials: Digital Projection: DP.U2.L2.7


 - Have students create a different style of visual representation to show
how many invertebrates there are on Earth compared to vertebrates (for
example, a pie graph, a bar graph, etc.)

**Writing Prompts**


Materials: Paper and pencil


 - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


 - Some characteristics of a reptile (or fish, bird, or mammal) are . . .




- An invertebrate is



.




- A vertebrate is



.

  - Compare and contrast an egret and a hippopotamus.


  - Compare and contrast a snake and a lizard.


  - Pretend you are a zoologist and you have discovered a brand new species
of animal. Describe the characteristics of the animal and how you would
classify it based on those characteristics. Be sure to name this new animal!


  - Imagine that you wake up one morning, and it is Morph Day! Animals in
your neighborhood and pets have morphed into different animal groups.
Explain how the features that once classified one or a few of these animals
into their correct groups have changed. Describe the changes and the new
classifications based on these metamorphoses.


  - Remind students to use their best cursive handwriting. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~

**Riddles for Core Content**

  - Present the following riddles to students:


    - This is a top category in the classification system that scientists use to
classify living things. Two of my types are called Plant and Animal. What is it?


» a kingdom


    - This is an animal that eats mainly other animals. What is it?

Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification



**320**


  - Ask the student to remove Activity Page 15.3 from his or her activity book.
You will use this worksheet to mark a running record as you listen to the
student read orally.


  - Tell the student that you are going to ask him or her to read the selection
aloud. Explain that you are going to keep a record of the amount of time it
takes him or her to read the selection. Please also explain to the student that
he or she should not rush but rather read at his or her own regular pace.


  - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page. If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the
Start Time since the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time. As the student
reads the selection, make a running record on the copy with the student’s
name using the following guidelines:

|Words read correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion was made.<br>If you have time, write down the word that was inserted.|
|**Words read incorrectly**|Write an “X” above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-corrected errors**|Replace original error mark with an “SC.”|
|**Teacher-supplied words**|Write a “T” above the word (counts as an error).|



  - When the student finishes reading the selection, write the exact Finish Time
in minutes and seconds on your record sheet. Alternatively, if you are using
a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds.
In the interest of time, ask students to read only the first three paragraphs
of text in either chapter. (Five minutes should be enough time to get a
measurement on most students.) If the student does not read to the end,
draw a vertical line on the record sheet to indicate how far he or she read.
Also write down either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time. After the student
finishes reading orally, you may direct him or her to finish reading the
remainder of the selection silently; you may also assess comprehension by
having students answer the following comprehension questions orally.


Lesson 15 Unit Assessment
**321**


**322**



1. **Literal.** Where do piranhas live?


» in South America in rivers, like the Amazon River, and lakes


2. **Literal.** What makes piranhas dangerous fish?


» They have sharp teeth, they can bite much stronger than a great white shark, and

they tear out a chunk of flesh when they bite.


3. **Literal.** Describe a piranha’s teeth


» They are razor-sharp and shaped like triangles.


4. **Literal.** Why might people think piranhas are always attacking people?


» Some scary movies make it seem that way.


5. **Literal.** What does the male piranha do for the eggs?


» guards them until they hatch


 - Repeat this process for additional students. Scoring can be done later,
provided you have kept running records and jotted down either the Elapsed
Time or the Start Time and the Finish Time.

**Guidelines for Calculating W.C.P.M. Scores**

 - If the reading was fairly accurate (< 10 uncorrected errors), you can get a
rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the
time and looking at the chart on Activity Page 15.3.


 - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote
down on the record sheet and follow the steps described below. The steps
are also shown in graphic form on Activity Page 15.3. You will probably find it
helpful to have a calculator available.


 - First, complete the Words section of Activity Page 15.3.


 - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student read
or attempted to read, up to the point where he or she stopped. It includes
words that the student read correctly as well as words that the student
read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the whole
selection, use 344 words total. If the student did not finish the selection, you
will need to count the number of words that the student actually attempted
to read. Write the count for Words Read in the matching box on Activity
Page 15.3.


 - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This includes
words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that you had to
supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes on Activity
Page 15.3. (A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted as
a mistake; the student is penalized for the time he or she lost making the
correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


  - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


  - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


  - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,
this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a
watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the Start
Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract seconds
from seconds and then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in Seconds.
Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to seconds, and
then add the number of seconds.


  - Next, complete the W.C.P.M. section of the worksheet.


  - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get Words
Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


  - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


    - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading
of school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary
from state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal
in 2006 for Fall of Grade 3 was 71 W.C.P.M.


    - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the scores of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Fall of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (44 W.C.P.M.) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


Lesson 15 Unit Assessment
**323**


**324**



**Piranhas**


Piranhas are meat-eating fish with razor-sharp teeth. If an animal goes into a
pond where these fish are, the piranhas may attack. A large school of hungry
piranhas can kill a large animal very quickly.


Piranhas live in South America. They are found in the Amazon River and in
other rivers and lakes.


Like most fish, piranhas lay eggs. The female lays up to five thousand eggs at
one time. The male piranha guards the eggs until they hatch. However, after
they hatch, the baby piranhas are on their own.


A typical piranha is five to ten inches long. It might weigh two pounds.


A piranha has a single row of teeth. These teeth are shaped like triangles and
are very sharp. In fact, they are so sharp that, in the past, some native people
used them to make weapons and tools.


Piranhas have very strong jaws. Pound for pound, they are stronger biters
than great white sharks!


Here is how scientists measure bite strength. First, they weigh the animal.
Next, they allow the animal to bite a special tool that measures how strong
its bite is. Finally, they divide the bite strength by the animal size.


A great white shark has a bite force about equal to its body. It might weigh
five thousand pounds, and it might bite with a force of about five thousand
pounds. A piranha is much smaller. It might weigh two pounds. But it can
bite with sixty pounds of force. Sixty divided by two is thirty. That means the
piranha’s bite strength is about thirty times as strong as a great white shark.


A piranha’s bite hurts a lot, but what makes it even worse is what comes
next. Once the piranha has bitten down, it spins away from its prey, tearing
out a chunk of flesh. Ouch!


Piranhas have been known to attack humans. But such attacks are not
common. There are some scary movies that make it sound like piranhas are
always attacking people. We know now that this is just not true.

**Spelling Analysis Directions**


Unit 2, Lesson 15


 - Students are likely to make the following errors: not changing the ‘y’ to ‘i’
before adding the _–es_ .


 - Leaving the ‘y’ in place and adding _–ies_ .


 - While either of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still
be aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find
it helpful to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the
analysis chart. For example: Is the student consistently making errors on
specific vowels? Which ones?


 - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?


 - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


 - Is the student consistently making errors on particular
beginning consonants?


 - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


 - Also, examine the dictated sentence for errors in capitalization
and punctuation.

Lesson 1 and 6: _“Rattenborough and Frieda”_


Lesson 11: _“All About Woodpeckers”_



**332**



Unit 2 Scales, Feathers, and Fur: Animal Classification


**Unit 2 | Lessons 1 and 6**
###### **Rattenborough and Frieda**





Rattenborough here! I was waving at you, but I wasn’t sure you

saw me.


That reminded me of the time I met my friend Frieda in the

woods. I was hiking, and it was just after sunset. I had a

flashlight so that I could see where I was going. Between the

trees, I thought I saw another flashlight bobbing up and down.

But then it blinked off. I thought someone must have tripped

while they were hiking. I rushed over to help. I looked all around

in the dark, but nobody was there.


Then a small light flashed right next to me. I guess you could

say I was shocked. I jumped and almost dropped my flashlight.

But then a little voice yelped, “Watch where you’re going!” That’s

when I saw where the light was coming from.


Have you guessed? It was Frieda. She’s a firefly. Fireflies talk to

each other with light. Chemicals mix in their bodies, creating light.


Despite the name, fireflies are really part of the beetle family.

They have strong, shell-like wings. They like living in warm, humid

woods and fields, and they love drifting near lakes and ponds.


I don’t know about you, but I think being able to light up would

be pretty useful. For one thing, you wouldn’t have to carry a

flashlight. For another thing, firefly lights are more efficient than

any light bulb humans have ever invented.


Frieda says that some fireflies are endangered. Humans are

moving into the places where fireflies once lived. But people

can help by planting bug-friendly gardens. People can also start

letting autumn leaves rot on the ground instead of bagging them

up as well as turning off outdoor lights that could be confusing

for insects like Frieda.

**Unit 2 | Lesson 11**
###### **All About Woodpeckers**





_Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!_ What is that?


Maybe you’ve heard something that sounds like quick hammering

in the trees. It might be a woodpecker. Different kinds of

woodpeckers live in the forests of almost every continent.


A woodpecker’s hammering noise comes from its beak. The

beak is long and sturdy, like a sharp tool. And, like a sharp

tool, the woodpecker uses its beak for digging into wood. The

woodpecker bangs its beak into tree trunks. It also pulls and

pries dry bark off the trunk.


Why would woodpeckers spend so much time shredding

branches? Do they hate trees? Nope! They’re hungry.

Woodpeckers eat insects like flies and beetles, as well as spiders

and millipedes. Many of these creepy-crawlies live in trees or lay

eggs in the wood.


Woodpeckers also eat nuts, grains, and seeds. The acorn

woodpecker drills holes into the sides of trees and stores acorns

in these holes.


A woodpecker’s noise carries far and wide. It helps other

woodpeckers know where to find it. The sound also helps

woodpeckers define their territories, or the areas where they live.


So, why don’t woodpeckers hurt themselves? If we hit our heads

against the trees, we could get badly hurt, but woodpeckers are

fine. For one thing, their brains are much smaller and lighter

than ours. We also know that some of the bones in their necks

are like sponges. They have open cavities, or pockets of air, that

might offer padding. Lastly, when woodpeckers are pecking,

most of the force is spread out towards their body and very little

to the bird’s brain. Woodpeckers remind us of the beauty of

nature and the world around us.
