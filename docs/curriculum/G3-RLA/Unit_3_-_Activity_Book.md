For Katie and Molly, when it’s hot during the summer, a day at the beach
is a perfect day! Katie, Molly, and their mom took a cab from their hotel to
the beach. At the beach, all three smeared sunblock all over their skin. It was
hot so they got in the water for a bit. Then they looked for seashells. After
that, Katie and Molly played volleyball with some teenagers. Katie made
some really sweet plays. In fact, a small group formed to watch her play. After
the game, Katie and Molly and their mom started to feel like they could use
some food. They left the beach to find something to eat. What a good day!

Cookies are the best treat. They are very sweet and very tasty. Also, there
are lots of different yummy flavors of cookies. If you get tired of one kind of
cookie, you can always try another kind. I can’t think of one thing that’s bad
about cookies.


Joyce is not good at singing. When she sings, she can never seem to hit the
right notes. If she is supposed to sing high, Joyce sings low. If she is supposed
to sing low, Joyce sings high. Even Joyce’s dog hates it when she sings!


Hugo is good at drawing. In fact, he once won a drawing contest. Hugo
drew a car for the contest, but he can draw all sorts of things. If you ask Hugo
to draw an animal or a person or a plant, his drawing will look just like the
real thing. He is the best artist I know.

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we will be reviewing the spelling of several types of plural
nouns. Some plural nouns are formed by adding _–s_ or _–es_ . For nouns ending
in ‘y’, the ‘y’ changes to an ‘i’ before adding _–es_ . Your student will also review
irregular singular and plural nouns. Your student will be assessed on these
words. On the assessment, your student will be asked to write the singular
and plural forms of these nouns.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _exercise_ and _laugh_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. They may not follow spelling
patterns and need to be memorized. Students will not be responsible for
changing the form of the Challenge Words.

Irregular nouns, such as _child_, cannot be made plural using the regular
patterns. Your student must learn and memorize the correct plural form.

The spelling words, including the Challenge Words, are listed below:

**Regular Singular Nouns** **Regular Plural Nouns**

1. match matches

2. night nights

glasses
3. glass

foxes
4. fox

stories
5. story

The Reader for Unit 3 is entitled _How Does Your Body Work?_ Although it is
a nonfiction Reader, Dr. Welbody, a fictional character, is the narrator who
guides students through the factual information. We are using Dr. Welbody
as the narrator in this Reader to make the informational text more accessible
to students. The Reader consists of selections that explain how a few of the
body systems work.

The chapters your student will read this week include information about
the skeletal and muscular systems. Students will learn important facts about
the skeletal and muscular systems—what they are and how they work.

Another way to classify animals is whether they are cold-blooded or
warm-blooded.


One characteristic that scientists study is the type of body covering on
an animal.


Animals can be classified or grouped by a set of common characteristics.


Warm-blooded animals can control their body temperature, but
the temperature of cold-blooded animals is affected by the outside
temperature.


Some animals have fur and some have scales to cover their bodies.


Classification makes understanding life easier and more organized.


Finally, scientists also study whether animals are vertebrates (having

backbones) or invertebrates (not having backbones).

**The Skeletal System**


Hello! My name is Dr. Welbody. Some of you may remember me. I visited
your school once before. You were in first grade then. We learned about some
of the systems that keep your body working. I told you to eat healthy food so
you would grow up to be big and strong. It looks like you listened to me, too! I
see that you have grown a lot since then! You are getting big and tall!

I am here today to help you learn more about the body and its systems.
In the next few days we will learn about three systems: the **skeletal system**,
the **muscular system**, and the **nervous system** .

I’d like to begin with the **skeletal system** . The **skeletal system** is made up
of bones that give your body shape.

I have a slideshow here on my computer. The first slide shows the **skeletal**
**system** . The picture on the right shows what the **skeletal system** looks like
from the front. The one on the left shows what it looks like from the side.

There are more than 200 bones in your body. When I went to medical
school to learn to be a doctor, I had to learn the name of every bone in the
body. I had to study very hard!

You kids don’t need to be able to name every bone in the body. But you
should know the names of some of the more important bones. So let’s get
started!

Let’s start at the top, with the **skull** . Doctors call this set of bones the
**cranium** . The **skull**, or **cranium**, has a very important job. It protects your
brain.

You might think the **skull** is all one big bone. But that’s not the case. In
fact, a human **skull** is a set of 22 bones.

Rub the back of your neck. Can you feel the bone that’s right at the base
of your neck? That’s one of the bones in your spine, or spinal column. The
spine is a chain of bones that runs down through your neck and back. It runs
from the base of the **skull** all the way down to your hips (or **pelvis** ).


**Grade 3** **Activity Book** **| Unit 3** **17**


The spinal column is made up of more than 30 smaller bones, stacked
one on top of another. These smaller bones are called **vertebrae** . The
**vertebrae** protect a bundle of nerves called the spinal cord. The spinal cord
delivers nerve signals to and from the brain.

You may remember learning that animals with spines, or backbones, are
called vertebrates. That’s because their spines are made up of **vertebrae** .

My next slide shows the bones inside your chest. If you tap on your chest,
right in the middle, you can feel your breastbone. It’s also known as the **sternum** .

If you tap a bit to the left or the right, you may be able to feel some of
your ribs. The ribs protect inner **organs** like the heart and lungs.

If you look at the slide, you can see why people sometimes talk about “the
rib cage.” The rib bones look like the bars of a cage.

Do you see the two large bones behind the rib cage? They are shaped
like triangles. There’s one on each side. These are your **shoulder blades** . The
medical name for the **shoulder blade** is the **scapula** .

The last two bones I want to tell you about are leg bones. They are called
the **tibia** and the **fibula** . These are the two bones in the lower part of your
leg. The **tibia** is the larger of the two.

Okay, that’s a lot of bones—and a lot of names. Let’s play Simon Says and
see if you can remember the names. I’ll be Simon.

Are you ready?

Simon says, tap your **skull** .
Simon says, now tap your **cranium** .
Ha! The **cranium** is the same thing as the **skull** . Did I trick any of you?
Simon says, flex your **vertebrae** by bending over and touching your **tibia** .
Simon says, take a deep breath and feel your rib cage **expand** .
Simon says, put your **pelvis** to work and sit down.
Now, reach back and see if you can touch one of your **scapulae**, or
**shoulder blades** .

Wait! I didn’t say Simon says! Did I catch anyone?

**The Skeletal System: Reader’s Theater**



Welcome to the Human Body Network. Today, we are visiting Mrs. Bones’
third-grade class as they learn about the skeletal system.

**Mrs. Bones**

Good morning, everyone. We have a special visitor today named Dr.
Welbody. Some of you may remember her. She visited your classroom
when you were in first grade.

**Dr. Welbody**

Hello! My name is Dr. Welbody. I visited your school a few years ago. We
learned about some of the systems that keep your body working.

**Everyone**

Hello! Hello!

**Dr. Welbody**

Well, let’s begin. The skeletal system is made up of bones. There are more
than 200 bones in your body. You kids don’t need to be able to name every
bone in the body. But you should know the names of some of the most
important bones. So let’s get started!

**Student 1 (tapping her head)**

What is the name of the bone that makes up my head?

**Dr. Welbody**

Good question! Your skull is made up of more than one bone. Doctors call
this set of bones the cranium.

I guess so.

**Dr. Welbody**

And the word _cranium_ sounds like the word _brain_ . The CRAN-ium
protects your BRAIN-ium!

**Everyone (giggling)**

The CRAN-ium protects your BRAIN-ium.

Dr. Welbody and Mrs. Bones are great teachers. The class is learning a lot
today!

**Dr. Welbody**

That was easy!

**Student 4 (tapping his chest)**

What about this bone right here in the middle of my chest? What is its
name?

**Dr. Welbody**

The sternum. Say it with me—sternum.

_For if it were on the outside,_

_You’d have a bony chest!_

I wish I were a third grader today!

**Student 6**

What about the bones in my legs? What are they called?

The two bones in your lower leg are called the tibia and the fibula. The
tibia is the larger of the two.

Yes, I do! You see in your Reader that one of the bones is larger than the
other. Well, here goes—a fib is a little lie and the fibula is the little leg bone.
How about that?

**All About Bones**


Last time, we learned the names of some of the bones in the body. Today,
I’d like to tell you a little more about bones.


The bone I’m pointing to is the human fibula bone. The fibula, you may
recall, is one of the bones in your leg.


The outer part of a bone is hard. It is made up of the same stuff as a
seashell you might find at the beach. That stuff is called **calcium** .

Do you like milk? Milk and other **dairy** products like cheese have lots of
**calcium** in them. They are good for your bones. One way to take good care
of your bones is to eat a healthy diet with **dairy** products. Exercise is also
good for your bones.

If you could look inside a bone, you’d see something called bone **marrow** .
Since you can’t see inside this bone, I’ll show you a slide.

This slide shows bone **marrow** **cells** . I think you may already know a
little about **cells** . Is that right? If you look at things with a strong microscope,
you can see that many things are made up of tiny **cells** . Your skin is made of
**cells** . So are your bones.

Here you can see some bone **marrow** **cells** . There are millions of **cells**
like these inside your bones. The bone **marrow** **cells** have an important job.
They are like little factories. They pump out red blood **cells** . Then, the red
blood **cells** carry oxygen all around the body.


As you get older and taller, your bones grow with you. Bones are strong.
They can support a great deal of weight. However, if we put too much


**Grade 3** **Activity Book** **| Unit 3** **29**


pressure on them, or if the pressure comes from the wrong direction, bones
can break.


This next slide shows a broken bone. This is a special kind of picture
called an **x-ray** .

**X-rays** are part of the invisible light spectrum. When you aim **x-ray** light
at your body, some parts of the body absorb a lot of **x-rays** and some do not.
Your bones are hard. They absorb a lot of the **x-ray** light. The soft **tissue**
around your bones absorbs less **x-ray** light. That is why doctors like **x-rays** .
We can aim **x-rays** at a part of your body and get a picture of the inside of
your body. We can use **x-rays** to find out if any bones are broken. You will
learn much more about **x-rays** in a later unit about light and sound.


Have any of you ever broken a bone?


I fix lots of broken bones each year. Would you like to know how I do it?

I start by taking **x-rays** . That’s how I find out if the bone is really broken.
If the **x-rays** show that a bone is broken, then I set the bone. That means I
put the bone pieces back in the right place. Once the bones are in the right
place, I put on a **cast** .


One of the remarkable things about the bones in your body is that they
are able to heal themselves. Once a broken bone has been set, it grows back
just like it was before it was broken.


Here’s a boy I fixed up last summer. He broke one of the bones in his
arm. I put the **cast** on to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal.
He had to wear the **cast** for two months while the bones healed. Then, I cut
the **cast** off for him.


He’s just fine now. His bone has healed and his arm is as good as new.

One of the best things about summer is that we don’t have school! I have the
whole day to do lots of fun things. Another good thing about summer is that
it is hot and sunny, so I can go swimming almost every day. Also, since it

**The Muscular System**


Have you ever seen a movie or a TV show in which skeletons chase
people? I saw a cartoon like that the other day. These kids were trying to
solve a mystery, but they were having problems. Every time they went out to
look for clues, a skeleton would pop out of a grave and chase them around.

Well, as a doctor, I have to tell you: that’s just not very **realistic** . Bones
don’t move all by themselves. In fact, bones don’t go anywhere at all without
**muscles** .

When I bend my arm, I do it by using **muscles** . I tighten the **muscles** in
my arm, and the **muscles** make the bones and the rest of the arm move.

When you kick a ball, it’s the same thing. You tighten the **muscles** in your
legs in order to move your leg bones.

This slide shows you some of the **muscles** in the muscular system. You
can see that there are lots of **muscles** in our bodies. There are about 650
**muscles** in the human body, in fact. About half of your body’s weight comes
from **muscles** !

**Muscles** are important to us for many reasons. Can you think of some?

**Muscles** help us run and jump. They allow us to stand up and sit down.
We use **muscles** when we lift heavy objects. We also use them when we chew
our food and when we smile. We even use **muscles** when we breathe.

Doctors divide **muscles** into two groups: **voluntary** **muscles** and
**involuntary muscles** . **Voluntary** **muscles** are **muscles** that you can make
move and control. **Involuntary muscles** are **muscles** that you can’t control.

The **muscles** that help you move your arms and legs are **voluntary**
**muscles** . When you want to pick up a box, you think about it and then
tighten the **muscles** in your arms so you can lift the box. You can also control
the **muscles** in your legs when you want to make your body run or jump.

The **muscles** in your heart, however, are **involuntary muscles** . They keep
your heart beating, whether you are awake or asleep. You don’t have to think,
“It’s time to beat again, heart!” These **muscles** work **automatically** .

**Joints and Muscles**


Does anyone know what we call the place where two bones come
together?

It’s called a **joint** .

You have lots of **joints** in your body. Your elbow is a **joint** . So is your
shoulder. So is your knee.

Many **joints** are **cushioned** by **cartilage** . **Cartilage** is a **flexible, connective**
tissue. It is not as hard as bone, but it is stiffer and less **flexible** than muscle.

Do you remember when we learned about the vertebrae—the bones
that make up your spinal column? Well, we have **cartilage** between each
of the 30 or so vertebrae in our spinal column. The **cartilage cushions** the
vertebrae and keeps them from rubbing or banging against each other. The
**cartilage** is shown in red in the **model** on the slide.

You also have **cartilage** in your ears. Grab the top of your ear and bend it
down a little. Now, let it go. Do you feel how your ear snaps back into place
when you let go of it? It’s the **cartilage** that makes your ear do that.

Some of the most important tissues in your body are located at the **joints** .

A **ligament** is a kind of tissue that connects one bone with another. Most
of your **joints** contain **ligaments** . You have **ligaments** in your knee, in your
neck, and in your wrists.

This slide shows **ligaments** in your knee. Can you see how the **ligaments**
connect your thigh bone to the bones in your lower leg?

**Ligaments** connect bones to other bones. **Tendons** connect muscles to
bones.


**Grade 3** **Activity Book** **| Unit 3** **51**


I said earlier that the muscular system and the skeletal system are
connected. Well, it’s the **tendons** that link these two systems. It’s the **tendons**
that connect muscles to bones and allow you to move your bones.

One of the most famous **tendons** in the body is called the **Achilles**

[ә-KIL-eez] **tendon** . Does anyone know where the **Achilles** **tendon** is?

That’s right! The **Achilles** **tendon** is in the back of your leg, just above the
heel. The **Achilles** **tendon** connects your heel bone to the muscles in your
lower leg. It’s an important **tendon** that you use when you walk or run.

Does anyone know why this **tendon** is called the **Achilles** **tendon** ?

No? Well, then, I guess I had better tell you the story.

The **Achilles tendon** is named for a famous Greek **warrior** named
**Achilles** . You may remember hearing about the ancient Greeks when you
were in second grade.

When **Achilles** was a baby, his mom tried to make sure that he would
never die. She had heard that a person who had been dipped in the River
Styx could not be harmed by spears or arrows. She took her son and
dipped him in the river. Then, she felt better. She believed that her son was
**invulnerable** . Nothing could harm him—or so she thought.

There was just one problem. When she dipped **Achilles** in the river, she
held him by his heel. So this heel never got dipped in the river.

Many years later, during the **Trojan** War, a **Trojan** **warrior** shot an arrow
at **Achilles** . The arrow landed right above **Achilles** ’ **s** heel—the very spot that
had not been dipped into the River Styx. **Achilles** died from his wound.

So now you know why the **Achilles tendon** is named for **Achilles** . This
**tendon** was the one spot where the mighty **warrior** was **vulnerable** and
could be wounded.

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, your student will continue to work with singular nouns and
their plural forms. Students will change the singular noun to a plural noun
by first changing the ‘f’ to ‘v’, dropping the final ‘e’ when appropriate, and
then adding the suffix _–es_ . Your student will be assessed on these words. On
the assessment, your student will be asked to write the singular and plural
forms of these nouns.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _before_ and _please_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. They may not follow spelling
patterns and need to be memorized. Students will not be responsible for
changing the form of the Challenge Words.

**The Spinal Cord and Brain**


You’ve got a lot of nerves! Really, you do!
You have nerves in your fingers. You have nerves in your toes. There are
nerves all over your body. But there are two parts of your body that are especially
important for your nervous system. One is the spinal cord. The other is the brain.

I told you a little about the spinal cord earlier, when we were looking at
the skeletal system. I told you that the bones that make up your spine—the
vertebrae—are there to protect your spinal cord. The vertebrae are **hollow**, and
long strings of nerves run through the **hollow** parts of the bones. The nerves
that make up the spinal cord run all the way up your back and neck. They end
up in the brain.

If I were to have a serious accident and damage my spinal cord, that
could be a very bad thing. I might end up **paralyzed** —unable to move my
legs and/or my arms. I might need to use a wheelchair to get around, like the
boy in this photograph.

You see, the brain uses the spinal cord as a sort of super-highway to send
messages out to the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is broken, or damaged,
the messages can’t get through to the arms and legs.

The spinal cord leads right to the center of your nervous system—your
brain. It’s the brain that receives messages from the nerves. It’s the brain that
sends messages out to your muscles. Even though the brain weighs only
2–3 pounds, it is the most important organ for life.

The brain is protected by the skull. Inside the skull, there are three layers
of **fiber** and **fluid** protecting the brain. So, the brain is really well-protected.
But it can still be harmed. Ask a football player who’s had a **concussion** .
Getting a **concussion** is like bruising the brain. Ouch!

The brain is divided into three main parts: the **medulla**, the **cerebellum**,
and the **cerebrum** . Each part has its own job to do.

The **medulla**, or “brain stem,” is located at the base of the skull in the
back, right where the spinal cord meets the brain.


**Grade 3** **Activity Book** **| Unit 3** **71**


The **medulla** controls the important involuntary actions of the body, like
breathing, heartbeat, and digestion.

The **cerebellum** sits right next to the **medulla** . It is divided into two
**hemispheres** or halves. The **cerebellum** has several jobs. One of them is to
control voluntary movements. That means the **cerebellum** helps you walk,
run, and jump.

The two **hemispheres** of the **cerebellum** control different parts of the
body. The right **hemisphere** controls movement on the left side of the body.
The left **hemisphere** controls movement on the right side. It might seem
strange that the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body, but
that’s just the way we’re made.

The third part of the brain is the **cerebrum** . The **cerebrum** sits on top of
the **cerebellum** and the **medulla** . It is the largest part of the brain.

Each part of the **cerebrum** has a certain job to do. For example, the front
part just inside your forehead controls emotions. The very back part just above
the brain stem controls the sense of sight. The sense of touch is controlled by a
strip of the brain running over the top of your head from ear to ear.

The outside part of the **cerebrum** is called the **cerebral cortex** . The **cerebral**
**cortex** is the wrinkly part of the brain that most people think about when they
think of a brain. People sometimes call this part of the brain “the gray matter.”

The **cerebrum** is divided into two **hemispheres**, just like the **cerebellum** .
Until recently, we did not know much about what the various parts of the
**cerebrum** do. But in the past few **decades**, we have learned a lot.

Scientists now have even more advanced ways than just x-rays to look
at and observe different organs in the body, including the brain. They use
something called a **PET scan** to see different parts of the brain work. A
scientist may ask the person having the **PET scan** to do something like talk or
blink his or her eyes. When the person performs different actions, different
parts of the brain light up on the computer screen. Scientists have learned a
lot about what happens where in the brain by looking at **PET scans** . As you
can see from this image of the brain, some of the things we do take place in
the left **hemisphere**, while others happen in the right **hemisphere** .

Francis Scott Key wrote a poem while watching the attack on Fort McHenry.

Andrew Jackson led the army in the Battle of New Orleans.

This poem later became a song known as “The Star-Spangled Banner,”

Key watched the American flag fly at Fort McHenry during the entire battle.

He was inspired to write the poem when he saw that the flag was still

**Eyes and Vision**


For the past few days I have been talking to you about the body and
its systems. Your teacher asked me if I could also tell you something about
**vision** and hearing.

I told her I could. I know a little about **vision** and a little about hearing,
but I am not an expert on either one. So, I told her I would bring in some
friends of mine who know more about these subjects.

I have one of those friends with me today. His name is Dr. Kwan Si-Yu.
He is a special kind of eye doctor called an **optometrist** . He can tell you all
about the eyes and how they work.

Hello, I am Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. Are you ready to learn all about eyes?

Good!

The human eye has several parts. I’d like to start by showing you two
parts you can see easily.

In the images on the right, you can see what eyes look like up close. The
**pupil** is the black part in the center of the eye. The **iris** is the colorful part of
the eye that surrounds the **pupil** .

The **iris** can be different colors. Some of you may have green eyes or
brown eyes. When we say that a person has green eyes or brown eyes, it’s his
or her **irises** we are talking about.

The **pupil** is not as colorful as the **iris** . It is always black, but it changes
shape. When it is dark, the **pupil** gets bigger to let more light in. When it
is very bright and sunny, the **pupil** shrinks to let less light in. How much
light will be let into the inside of your eye depends on the shape of the
**pupil** .

Now, let’s learn about some parts of the eye that you can’t see just by
looking at a person’s face.


**Grade 3** **Activity Book** **| Unit 3** **85**


This slide shows some parts of the eye as they would look if you could
see inside a person’s head. You are looking at them from the side.

You can see the **iris** and the **pupil** . There are also some other parts shown.

  - The **cornea** is a thin, clear tissue that covers the colored part of the eye.
It helps protect the eye from dirt and germs.

  - The **lens** is the part of your eye that focuses light. The **lenses** in your
eyes curve outward.

  - The **retina** is made of a special kind of tissue that is very sensitive to
light. Light from the **lens** falls on the **retina** . Then, nerves in the **retina**
send messages to the brain.

  - These messages travel down a nerve called the **optic nerve** .

Now, let’s see how all of these parts work together so you can see things.
You may be surprised to learn that the eye does not really see objects.
Instead, it sees the light that reflects off objects.

Light passes into the eye—first through the **cornea**, and then through
the **pupil** . If it’s dark, the **pupil** expands to let more light in. If it’s bright, the
**pupil** gets smaller to let less light in. When a doctor shines a light in your
eyes, she is watching to see if your **pupils** change shape.

Next, the light passes through the **lens**, which focuses the light and
projects it onto the **retina** .

The **retina** is lined with special cells called **rods and cones** . These
are special kinds of nerve cells that sense light. The **rods and cones** send
information to the brain, using the **optic nerve** .

All of this happens very quickly—so quickly that it seems like you see
things at the exact moment you look at them. In reality, though, you are
seeing them a split second later.

The brain combines the information passed through the **optic nerve** of
each eye to make one image. That is when you “see” the object.

**Dear Family Members,**

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing spelling patterns and irregular spellings that
we have already learned. Your student will be assessed on these words. On
the assessment, your student will be asked to determine the appropriate form
of a word to fit in a sentence given orally. Students have reviewed all rules
and unique spellings for these words. The chart on the next page lists the
words for this week and the pattern or note for each. The bolded words are
the spelling words for this week.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _across_ and _idea_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. They may not follow spelling
patterns and need to be memorized. Students will not be responsible for
adding any suffixes to the Challenge Words.

People with disabilities face extra **challenges** in life. It can be hard to
make your way in the world when you are deaf or blind. However, these
disabilities don’t keep **determined** people from doing amazing things.

This is a painting of the musician Ray Charles. Ray Charles went blind
when he was seven years old. He couldn’t see, but there was nothing wrong
with his ears. He loved music and decided to become a musician. He learned
to sing and play the piano. **Eventually**, he became one of the most popular
musicians of his day.

Ray Charles won 10 **Grammy Awards** and made millions of dollars as a
singer. He did not let his disability hold him back.

This next image shows a girl named Helen Keller. Helen Keller lost both
her sight and her hearing from a serious illness when she was just 19 months
old. She was deaf and blind for the rest of her life.

As a young girl, Helen Keller could not hear or speak. She learned to
communicate a few ideas by making gestures. When she wanted her mother,
she would grab and pull her mother to her. When she wanted to be alone,
she would push her mom away. She could nod her head to say yes or shake
it to say no. When she wanted toast, she would make a gesture as if she was
spreading butter on bread.

There were a few ideas she could communicate. Yet there were many
things she could not get across with gestures. As a child, she would often try
to communicate and fail. Then, she would get angry and cry. Sometimes she
would have terrible **temper tantrums** . She wanted, more than anything, to
communicate with people. She was not able to do so.

Helen’s parents were worried about her. They did not know how to help
her communicate. Since she was deaf and blind, she could not attend school.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 3** **97**


So, her parents **searched** and found a special teacher who came to live with
them. The teacher’s name was Annie Sullivan.

Annie Sullivan wanted to teach Helen to understand words, but how
can you understand words if you can’t hear them? Sullivan started by giving
Helen a doll to hold. Then, she took Helen by the hand and traced the letters
d-o-l-l on her **palm** . She did this over and over. After a while, Helen learned
to write the letters d-o-l-l on a page. She did not know that she had written a
word. She did not even know that words **existed** . But she felt proud that she
could **imitate** what her teacher was doing.

Her teacher, Annie Sullivan, traced more words on Helen’s **palm** . She
learned to spell _pin_, _hat_, _cup_, and a few other words. The real **breakthrough**
happened when Annie tried to teach Helen the word _water_ . Sullivan took
Helen outside to a **well** . She placed one of Helen’s hands under the **spout** and
spelled w-a-t-e-r on her other **palm** . Suddenly, something **seemed to click**
in Helen’s head. She understood that w-a-t-e-r meant the “wonderful, cool
something” that was flowing over her hand.

Helen soon learned more words. When she was eight, she went to a
special school for the blind. Sullivan went with her. Later, she went to a school
for the deaf. But she didn’t stop there. She went on to Radcliffe College, where
she became the first deaf and blind person to receive a **college degree** .

Helen learned to speak and she learned to read lips with her fingers. She
learned to read, using braille. She wrote books, including a biography of
her own life, _The Story of My Life_ . She was **active** in **politics** and fought for
women to have the right to vote.

Helen Keller lived a long and productive life. She died in 1968 at the age
of 87.

In 2003, the state of Alabama honored Helen Keller by putting an image
of her on their state quarter. The quarter pays **tribute** to Helen’s **courage** in
overcoming her disabilities and inspiring millions of people.

**The Body Tells a Story: The Case of Otzi, the Iceman**


In 1991, two hikers were out for a hike in the Alps mountain range, in
Europe. One of them spotted something sticking out of the ice. They went
to have a look. It turned out to be a body. The hikers thought it might be the
body of a hiker who had died recently. They notified the police.


The body was unearthed and examined. It turned out to be the body of a
man who died about 5,300 years ago. His body had not decayed much. It had
been covered by snow and ice. The snow and ice had preserved the body.


At that point, the police began to lose interest. Whoever the man was,
he was not the victim of a crime in the recent past. On the other hand,
scientists and historians started to get more interested. This man—who was
nicknamed Otzi—had lived a long time ago in prehistoric times. He lived
back when writing had not yet been invented. Many people were hoping
Otzi’s body might help us learn more about how human beings lived in
prehistoric times.


Scientists began to study the iceman’s body. They looked at his skeleton.
They measured his bones. The bones helped them pin down some key facts.
They made it clear that Otzi was a man. He was about 45 when he died. He
stood about 5 feet, 4 inches tall. He weighed about 110 pounds. He would be
a bit on the small side today. He may have been normal size 5,000 years ago.


One scientist looked at Otzi’s leg bones. He found that Otzi had strong
bones. The iceman’s tibia was thick and strong. It had been strengthened


**Grade 3** **Activity Book** **| Unit 3** **99**


by traveling long distances on sloping ground. Otzi had apparently walked
many miles on the slopes of the Alps. He may have been a shepherd who
tended a herd of animals. The scientist also found a small fracture in Otzi’s
hip bone. This is an injury that was caused by years of wear and tear.


Another scientist looked at Otzi’s teeth. He found tiny specks of pollen
and dust in Otzi’s tooth enamel. These tiny grains came from specific kinds
of plants. They suggested that Otzi spent his childhood in a specific area in
Northern Italy where such plants grow. Later, he moved farther north into
the area where his body was found.


Scientists used x-rays to examine Otzi’s body. One x-ray showed that he
had an arrowhead lodged in his left shoulder. Apparently, someone shot him
with an arrow. It may have been the arrow that killed him, but scientists are
not sure.


Other scientists looked at Otzi’s digestive system. In Otzi’s intestines, they
discovered the remains of two meals. These were the meals he had eaten in
the hours before his death. The main course for one meal consisted of meat
from a chamois, a kind of antelope. During this meal, Otzi also ate some
roots and fruits. The other meal included meat from a red deer, along with
more roots and fruits.


Scientists found tiny grains of pollen from pine trees in Otzi’s food. These
suggested that Otzi ate one of his last meals in a pine forest and that he died
during the springtime, when pollen is produced by plants.


The scientists also found wheat and barley in Otzi’s stomach. They think
these grains may have been grown by Otzi and his kinsmen, rather than
picked in the wild. The grains may have been baked to make bread.

A group of scientists studied Otzi’s lungs. They found that his lungs were
blackened, probably from the smoke of campfires.


You might not think fingernails are very interesting. But it turns out they
are. Fingernails provide a record of bodily health, sort of like the rings of a
tree. Otzi’s fingernails had three odd lines. Scientists think each line was left
by an illness. Otzi was probably sick three times in the six months before he
died. His last sickness seems to have lasted about two weeks.


You can see that people were right to be excited about the discovery of
Otzi’s body. By studying his body, we have learned a lot about how human
beings may have lived in prehistoric times.

**Lost and Found**


It was very crowded at Megaland that day. I was six years old. I went on
a spin-around ride with Mom and Dad. On the way out, they turned right. I
was swept off to the left with a crowd of other people. Soon, I was standing
outside the ride all by myself. I was not sure what to do.


I walked along a path. “Mom?” I called out. “Dad?”


Mom and Dad were on the other side of the ride looking for me. They
were worried. They looked for me but could not find me.


I could not find them either. The park was too crowded. I was not sure
what to do. Then, I remembered something Mom told me once: “If you
ever get lost, look for a mom with kids.” I sat down on a bench and started
looking for a mom. After a while, a kind-looking mom came by with three
kids. Their dad was with them, too. The mom looked nice—friendly in a
mom sort of way. I walked up to her and tugged on her blouse.


“Excuse me,” I said. “My name is Amy, and I’ve lost my mommy.”


She seemed to understand right away. “Don’t worry!” she said. “We’ll take
you to the security office and help you find your parents.”


We set out for the security office, but there was a big parade going on.
The guard said we could not cross the road until the parade was over.


While we were waiting, the mom asked me some questions.


“What’s your last name, sweetheart?”


“Jones.”


**Grade 3** **Activity Book** **| Unit 3** **105**


“And where are you from?”


“Muncie, Indiana.”


“What do your parents do?”


“My mommy is a nurse, and my daddy is the mayor.”


She asked me some more questions. The dad didn’t seem to be paying
much attention to me. He was tapping away on his cell phone. I was surprised
when he said, “Good news, Amy! I just got a text message from your dad!”


“You what?” said the mom.


The dad explained, “Amy said her dad was the mayor of Muncie, Indiana.
I looked him up on the Internet and sent him a text message. He just texted
me back. I told him that we’ll meet him at the Misty Mountain ride as soon
as the parade is over.”


So that is how I got lost . . . and found again. Pretty cool, isn’t it?

**Reflexes**


The students in the class were talking among themselves. None of 11

them were paying attention to their science teacher, Mr. Brown. 21


Mr. Brown walked over to his bookshelf. He took a huge book off the 35
shelf. It was a dictionary. It weighed about five pounds. He held the book 49
out with two hands. Then, he let it fall. 58


SMACK! 59

The book slammed against the floor. 65

The students were startled. Sally almost jumped out of her chair. Ned 77
twitched. Jimbo blinked and shook his head. Susan was so scared she 89
shouted “Whuh?” 91

The students turned to look at Mr. Brown. Some of them looked 103
shocked. Some of them looked annoyed. 109

“What’s the deal, Mr. Brown?” Susan said. “Why did you drop that book?” 122

“I was testing your reflexes,” said Mr. Brown. 130

“What?” said Ned. “Did you say test? Do we have a test today? Oh, 144
man! I am going to fail! I totally forgot to study!” 155

Mr. Brown smiled. “Don’t worry, Ned. This is a test you can pass 168
without even trying!” 171

“Cool!” said Ned. “That’s my kind of test!” 179


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 3** **111**


“You see,” Mr. Brown explained, “that’s the thing about reflexes. You 190

don’t have to think about them. A reflex is something you just do without 204

thinking. Sally, when I dropped that book, did you think, Goodness! A loud 217

noise! I think I will show how surprised I am by jumping out of my seat?” 233


“No,” said Sally. “I don’t remember thinking anything at all.” 243


“Exactly,” said Mr. Brown. “That’s how reflexes work. If you touch 254

a hot stove, you don’t want to have to think things out. You want to be 270

able to react right away, without having to think about it. This is one of 285

the ways in which your nervous system keeps you safe. Your nerves are 298

always on the lookout. They react, on their own, to loud noises. They feel 312

vibrations. They sense heat. Your nervous system is like a watchdog that 324

never sleeps. It is always protecting you and your body.” 334
