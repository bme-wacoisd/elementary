**Grade 3 | Unit 3**

Introduction


~~**THE HUMAN BODY: SYSTEMS AND SENSES**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach _The Human Body: Systems_
_and Senses_ unit. This unit contains 12 daily lessons, plus two Pausing Point days that may be used for
differentiated instruction. Each lesson will require a total of 120 minutes. Lesson 13 contains the Unit
Assessment.


As noted, two days are intended to be used as Pausing Point days. These Pausing Points are
embedded into the instruction at appropriate points, with the first one after Lesson 7 and the

second after Lesson 12. You may choose to continue to the next lesson and schedule the first
Pausing Point day for another day in the unit sequence. Pausing Points can be used to focus on

content understanding, writing, spelling, grammar, morphology skills, or fluency.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS**~~


**Reading**


The nonfiction Reader for Unit 3, entitled _How Does Your Body Work?,_ consists of selections that
will further students’ scientific understanding of the skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems of the
human body. The role of various body parts and organs associated with each system, such as bones,
joints, muscles, nerves, the spinal cord, and the brain, will be described. Students will also take an
in-depth look at the senses of sight and hearing and the various body parts that enable these senses
to function properly. The later chapters of the Reader will provide insight into difficulties that may

occur when vision and/or hearing are impaired and how people cope with these challenges.


**Spelling**


During this unit’s spelling exercises, students will review the spelling of regular and irregular plural
nouns, as well as adding _–s_ or _–es_ to certain verb forms. Students will review changing the letter ‘f’ to
‘v’ and adding the suffix _–es_ to create the plural form of words. Students will review spelling patterns
and irregular formation of plurals to correctly spell plural words. In addition, students will have two
Challenge Words added to each spelling list.


Students will also continue to practice alphabetizing spelling words in preparation for dictionary skills.


**Grammar**


Grammar continues with a review and expansion of skills introduced in second grade. Students will identify
and write topic and concluding sentences for paragraphs and will write and sequence supporting detail
sentences within paragraphs. Students will remove irrelevant sentences in paragraphs and write titles for
paragraphs. Students will be introduced to a new part of speech called a pronoun. Specifically, they will learn

to replace nouns that are subjects of sentences with subject pronouns.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



Students will apply their new knowledge of pronouns by determining subject-verb agreement in

sentences, recognizing the pattern of adding _–s_ or _–es_ to third person singular verbs.


**Morphology**


Throughout Grade 3, students will study word parts, such as prefixes, suffixes, and root words, during the
morphology portion of the lessons. In this unit, students will study the common prefixes _dis–_ and _mis–_
and review prefixes learned thus far in Grade 3, which are _un–_, _non–_, _re–_, _pre–_, _dis–_, and _mis–_ . They will
continue to review how prefixes change the meaning of root words and how they may change the part of

speech of that word. Students will define and use words with these prefixes in different contexts.


~~**WHY THE HUMAN BODY: SYSTEMS AND SENSES IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit reviews what students have already learned about the human body and some of its systems.

Two systems students have previously learned about in greater depth are the excretory and digestive

systems in Grade 2, so these are briefly reviewed here. In this unit, students will focus in greater detail

on the skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems and the fact that they are closely interconnected with

all the human body systems. Furthermore, students will learn details about the senses of sight and

hearing and how the eyes and ears work. Students will also discover ways they can keep their bodies

active and healthy.


Throughout this unit students will use descriptive words to discuss parts of the body. Encourage

students to use language that is kind, sensitive, inclusive, and supportive of all body types, shapes,

and sizes.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for students

to build content knowledge and draw connections to science. You may build on class discussions

to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Organisms and

Environments, Scientific and Engineering Practices, and Recurring Themes and Concepts. This

content is not a replacement for grade level Science instruction. For more information about the

quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures

of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction from this program in Grades 1–2 will already have pertinent

background knowledge for this unit. For students who have not received prior instruction in the

program, introductory knowledge is addressed at the beginning of each unit.


The Five Senses (Kindergarten)


The Human Body (Grade 1)


The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition (Grade 2)


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students have many opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for different purposes. The formal

writing piece for _The Human Body: Systems and Senses_ unit asks students to write about one of the

systems covered in the unit. Students must include an appropriate title, a description of the system,

an explanation of how the system works with other systems, and a drawing of the system(s).


Everyday writing opportunities come in many forms, including: maintaining a “unit dictionary”

notebook containing definitions, sentences, and/or other writing exercises that use Core and

Academic Vocabulary Words; Quick Writes; written responses to prompts requiring comprehension

of key elements from unit readings; and teacher-led writing practices. Students will also use graphic

organizers to gather and categorize information from Read-Alouds, readings, or to plan for writing.

Many writing lessons provide opportunities for students to collaborate, share ideas, and exchange

feedback on their writing.


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving

appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete

activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**PERFORMANCE TASKS AND ASSESSMENTS**~~


The Primary Focus objectives in each lesson are carefully structured and sequenced throughout the

unit to help build student understanding. Additionally, formative assessments are provided to help

keep track of student progress toward objectives and standards. These can be found in the Student

Activity Book and are referenced in every lesson.


_The Human Body: Systems and Senses_ unit ends with a Unit Assessment consisting of a student

skills assessment (ask and answer questions about the text), a reading fluency assessment, a written

reflection, and a spelling assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available for download in the program’s online

materials. This component was created to accompany materials for Grade 3. It consists of selections

from a variety of genres, including poetry, folklore, and fables. These selections provide additional

opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody).

For more information on implementation, please consult the supplement.


**TEKS 3. 2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

The systems of the human body are organ systems. Each system is made

up of organs, parts of the body with clearly defined functions. For example,

your stomach is an organ. Your stomach works closely with other organs—

your mouth, your esophagus, your liver, and your intestines. These organs

are all parts of your digestive system. Each one of these organs has a

specific function to perform as part of your digestive system’s overall job,

which is to break down your body’s food.

use these words immediately, but with repeated exposure throughout the

lessons, they will acquire a good understanding of most of the words. Students

may also keep a “unit dictionary” notebook along with definitions, sentences,

and/or other writing exercises using these vocabulary words.


**cells,** the smallest units that make up living things and are microscopic.


**circulate,** to move around in a loop or circle


**functions,** the actions or activities that something was designed to do


**organs,** major parts of the body formed by tissues that perform

specific functions


**tissues,** masses of cells that have a specific structure and come together to

form organs

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD: KWL (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.6.B**~~


 - Tell students they will learn about how the human body works, and review

different ways to keep their bodies healthy. Ask students why it is important

to take care of their bodies and keep them healthy. Tell students that they

will be learning mostly about three of the human body systems—the skeletal,

muscular, and nervous systems—and how they work together to help the

human body function. Explain that there are more systems in the human body,

but for now—with the exception of a brief overview and review of some other

systems—they are going to learn mainly about these three. Tell students they

will learn more about human body systems in later grades.


 - Display the KWL chart to introduce this unit. Use multiple pieces of chart

paper so that you can add more information to the chart as students listen


deepen understanding and gain information; **TEKS 3.7.C** Use text evidence to support an appropriate response; **TEKS 3.3.D** Identify, use, and explain the meaning of antonyms, synonyms, idioms, homophones, and homographs in a text.

to the various Read-Alouds. This chart will be used throughout the

Read-Alouds to determine what your students may already know (K),

what they wonder about or want to know (W), and what they have learned

(L) about the various human body systems.


**Note:** You may choose to assign each system and sense its own piece of

chart paper for the KWL chart, Activity Page 1.1, or you may assign all of the

‘K’ items to one piece of paper, all of the ‘W’ items to another, and so on.

- Prior to recording the students’ responses, point out that you are going to

write down what they say. Give students the opportunity to share anything

they already know about how their bodies work, and how the different body

systems work together. As students respond, repeat and expand upon each

response, using richer and more complex language, including, if possible, any

Read-Aloud vocabulary. Record students’ responses under the ‘K’ of the KWL

chart. If a student’s response includes inaccurate factual information, record

it nonetheless and revisit and correct the misconception once the correct

factual information has been presented.


- Have students take out Activity Page 1.1, where they will record the

class responses.


- Ask students, “What are some of the things you want to know or that you

wonder about the human body?” Record their responses under the ‘W’ of

the KWL chart. Tell your students that after they have listened to some of

the Read-Alouds in this unit, they will have a chance to share what they have

learned. These answers will be listed under the ‘L’ portion of the chart. As

students listen to the upcoming Read-Alouds, remind them occasionally of

the ‘W’ to see if they can find answers to some of their questions.


**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD:**
~~**“BUILDING BLOCKS AND SYSTEMS” (20 MIN.)**~~


- Prepare to project the following Digital Images from the program’s online

materials during the Read-Aloud: U3.L1.1–U3.L1.11.


- Read the title of today’s Read-Aloud: “Building Blocks and Systems.” Remind

students that titles of books and stories often foreshadow, or give a hint or

clue about, what they will be reading or hearing. Ask students what they

think they will be learning about based on the title. Tell students that over

the next few weeks, they will be learning about the human body, its many

interconnected systems, and how these systems are related to our senses.

Ask students if they are familiar with any human body systems, and ask them

to explain what a system is (a group of items or things that are connected and

work together as a single item to achieve a particular result).


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


 - Ask students if they think their human body is simple, or if it’s like a complex

machine made up of many different parts. Ask, “Can you think of any complex

machines?” Give students the example of a bicycle, and ask them what would

happen if one part of the bike, like the chain, failed to work properly. Tell them

that many of the human body’s functions take place internally, inside our

bodies. Explain that many complex systems are working together in our bodies

without us really paying attention to them. Tell students to sit very still and quiet

and to feel their heartbeat. Ask, “Do you have to think to make your heart beat,

or does your body do it automatically?”

Ricardo and Dr. Welbody in
the doctor’s office


                   - Ask students if they remember

Dr. Welbody, the rhyming pediatrician

from Grade 1: The Human Body. Tell

them they will be learning about

the human body from a narrator named Ricardo who loves to tell

riddles about the human body. Ask them to explain what a riddle is,

and if time allows, give an example and/or have students share one

or two riddles they know.

  - Tell students to listen carefully to the Read-Aloud to hear a little bit about the

skeletal, muscular, nervous, digestive, circulatory, respiratory, and excretory

systems. Remind students that they will be hearing riddles about each of

these systems, so they should listen carefully to guess the correct answers.

Also, tell students to listen carefully to find out about the building blocks of

the human body. Explain that a riddle is a word puzzle.

Hello, everybody. I’m Ricardo. I’m in

the fourth grade, and I am fascinated

by the human body and its complex,

interconnected systems. I hope to

continue to learn about the human body in great detail and become a

doctor someday.

**16**



Dr. Welbody is a friend of mine. Who remembers Dr. Welbody? She’s

the rhyming pediatrician whom some of you may have met when you

were in first grade. Dr. Welbody taught you about your body using

several rhymes like this one:


Everybody has a body

And I have one, too.

It is grand to understand

The things our bodies do.


Dr. Welbody just happens to be my very own pediatrician. She’s also

one of my teachers, but not the kind you find in a school. Because

she’s taught me so much about my body, she has asked me to come

share a little of what I’ve learned with you. Thanks for welcoming me.

I can’t wait!


**Show Image U3.L1.2**
A group of people together, a network of
systems


Our bodies are often compared with

machines. That comparison may

seem strange to you at first, because

machines are nonliving objects and our bodies are very much alive.

But think about it: Machines are made up of networks. Human body

systems include lots of different parts working together to perform

very special jobs. Dr. Welbody says that our bodies are the most

marvelous machines on Earth, and I think you will agree with her

once we review how our bodies work.


Just as Dr. Welbody loves rhymes, I love riddles! So, expect to hear a

lot of riddles from me. Let’s begin our lesson with one now:


_I am as strong as a tree trunk, but with a little help from other human_

_body systems, I can bend in many directions. I give your body its_

_shape. What am I?_

The skeletal system


It is your skeleton. Does anyone know

which system of the body includes

your skeleton? Your skeletal system,

that bony network that supports you

and protects important organs inside your body. The skeletal system

is only one of many systems working together in your body.


Check for Understanding


What is the function of the skeletal system?

» It supports the human body and protects important organs in

the body.


Now, I’m going to ask you some more riddles. See if you can match

the riddle to the right body system. Ready? Let’s go:


_I’m the system that makes your bones move. I also help you blink and_

_swallow. What system am I?_


**Show Image U3.L1.4**
The muscular system


The muscular system is made up of

muscles. Muscles are the motors of the

human machine, and they keep your

body moving in lots of different ways.

Some are attached to your bones and help you run and throw a ball.

Others line the walls of the stomach, squeezing in and then relaxing to

help digest your food. Small muscles in your face help you smile.


Your strongest and most important muscle, your heart, works

nonstop, pumping blood throughout your body, day and night.

**Show Image U3.L1.5**
The nervous system


The nervous system is your body’s

communicator. It tells your body what

to do. Nerves run throughout your

body, from head to toe, like a giant

road system. Nerves send messages up and down your spine to your

brain. The nervous system controls your muscles, telling them how to

move. It also helps all your other systems do their jobs.

What is the function of the nervous system?

» Nerves run all through the human body, sending messages up

and down the spine and to and from the brain. The nervous

system controls the other human body systems, helping them

do their jobs.

The digestive system


The digestive system helps you digest,

or break down, your food. It splits

your food into nutrients, giving your

body the matter and energy to live and

grow. Food enters your mouth and travels down a long tube called the

esophagus, all the way to the stomach and the intestines. It takes food

nearly two days to pass all the way through your body.

What is the function of the digestive system?

» It helps to break down food, splitting your food into nutrients that

give the body matter and energy to help it live and grow.

**Show Image U3.L1.7**
The excretory system


The excretory system excretes, or

gets rid of, liquids such as sweat and

urine that may be harmful to the body.

Your skin, the largest organ of the

body, excretes sweat through its many pores. A pair of organs called

the kidneys filter harmful substances and extra water from the blood

and send them to your bladder. Your bladder looks like a bag, holding

excess fluid, or urine, until it is ready to pass out of your body.

Here’s another riddle:


_I am your body’s delivery system. I deliver nutrients and oxygen to_

_all parts of your body. Nutrients and oxygen circulate, or are carried_

_throughout the body, by blood vessels. The heart acts as my pump._

_What system am I?_


**Show Image U3.L1.8**
The circulatory system


The circulatory system is made up

of your heart, blood vessels, and

blood. Blood enters your heart and

is pumped into a large blood vessel.

Blood vessels carry blood to every part of your body and loop back

again. This circulation of the blood, carrying nutrients and oxygen,

happens all day and all night.


Check for Understanding


What is the function of the circulatory system?

» The pumping of the heart circulates the nutrients and oxygen in

the blood all around the body through blood vessels.


Here’s the last riddle for now:


_I carry oxygen to your blood. Without oxygen, you cannot live. I also_

_get rid of a gas called carbon dioxide that the body does not need. I_

_help you breathe. What system am I?_

**Show Image U3.L1.9**
The respiratory system


The respiratory system brings oxygen
filled air into your body. You can live

without food for days, but you cannot

live for more than a few minutes

without oxygen. You breathe in air

through your mouth and nose, and exhale a gas called carbon dioxide.

Air travels through a tube into your lungs, the organs that take up

most of your chest. Your lungs take in the oxygen that keeps you alive.

What is the function of the respiratory system?

» It helps bring oxygen into the human body and gets rid of a gas

called carbon dioxide.

The interconnected human body systems


Wow everybody, you’ve identified

seven of the body’s systems! Let’s

see if you can name all seven with

me: skeletal, muscular, nervous,

digestive, excretory, circulatory, and respiratory. Now, it’s time to find

out what all these systems have in common.


The systems of the human body are organ systems. Each system is

made up of organs, parts of the body with clearly defined functions.

For example, your stomach is an organ. Your stomach works closely

with other organs—your mouth, esophagus, liver, and intestines.

These organs are all parts of your digestive system. Each one of these

organs has a specific function to perform as part of your digestive

system’s overall job, which is to break down your body’s food.



Challenge


Have students identify
each system shown on
Image U3.L1.10.

examples of other things
that are interconnected in

Organs are made up of tissues. Tissues are masses of cells that have

a specific structure and come together to form organs. There are

many different types of tissues, including muscle, bone, skin, blood,

and nerve tissue. Each type of tissue is made up of different groups

of similar cells that do the same jobs. All body tissues are made up of

cells. What exactly are cells?


Cells are tiny building blocks—so tiny, in fact, that nobody even knew

what they were or that they existed until microscopes were invented

about 400 years ago. Microscopes magnify cells, making them big

enough to see and study. Your body contains trillions of cells.


Cells come in all shapes and sizes, depending upon the jobs they

must perform. For example, red blood cells look like bagels with dents

instead of holes. They travel through your blood, carrying important

nutrients throughout your body. Skin cells, grouped together in skin

tissue, are packed tightly together to form a protective boundary

between you and your environment. Your skin is your largest organ.

Nerve cells are grouped together in nerve tissue, and often have long

extensions that send and receive messages quickly. Muscle cells,

grouped together in muscle tissue, look very different, too. They are

long and lean, helping the body move as they stretch and shorten.


Each body system is made up of different types of cells. There are

over 200 different types of cells in your body. Everything you do,

from breathing to eating to running to sleeping, requires lots of

working cells. They are truly the building blocks of your body. Without

cells, there would be no body tissues, no body organs, and no body

systems. In fact, all living things have cells. There would be no living

things on Earth if it weren’t for cells!


Cells are alive, and living things do not last forever. Some cells live for

only a few days. Others live for years. Some cells become damaged

when you get hurt. Others wear out over time, but inside your body’s

tissues, cells are constantly dividing and multiplying. One cell

becomes two cells, two cells become four, four become eight, and so

forth. As cells die, the dead cells are replaced with new cells on a daily

basis. Isn’t the life cycle of cells amazing?

Ricardo waving good-bye


Well, everybody, we’re out of time.

Today you heard a little about a lot of

body systems. Next time, I’ll be back

to give you a peek inside your body.

I’m looking forward to discussing the human body systems with you.

See you next time!


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (15 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** Describe cells and their function.


» Cells are the building blocks of life, and they are found only in living things.

Cells are living things that are constantly dividing and multiplying; they can

also die.


2. **Inferential.** What are organs?


» Organs are parts of the body that have specific functions and form systems;

organs include the heart, lungs, stomach, etc.


3. **Evaluative.** Why are human bodies compared to complex machines?


» The human body, like a complex machine, is composed of several

different systems that do specific jobs. These different systems have

many different, interconnected parts and need to work together in order

to function properly.


4. **Evaluative.** Compare and contrast human lungs to fish gills.


» Both take in oxygen, which is necessary for survival; lungs get oxygen from the air,

whereas gills get oxygen from the water.


I am going to ask a question. I will give you a minute to think about the question, and
then I will ask you to turn to your neighbor and discuss the question. Finally, I will
call on several of you to share what you discussed with your partner.


5. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ What are some of the ways the various

systems are working in your body at this moment?

◦As you introduce each plural noun, write it in cursive in the table and

pronounce the first two words as you write them. Then, have students read

each word as it is written.


◦Point out that for _story_ and _baby_, the ‘y’ is changed to ‘i’, then the _–es_

- When introducing the words, use these procedures:


**Step 1: Introducing the Irregular Singular Nouns**


◦Tell students that the next set of nouns are irregular, which means that the

plural form of these words cannot be created using any of the patterns for

the regular formation of plurals. Students must learn and memorize the

correct plural form.


◦Have irregular singular nouns already written on the chart in cursive.

Provide guidance for sound/spelling patterns: /ie/ spelled ‘I’ and /oo/

spelled ‘oo’. Then, have students read words chorally, noting vowel sounds

and chunking words into syllables prior to the teacher writing the plural

form of these words.


◦Point out the vowel sound(s) and spellings in the word to students. For

example, for the word _child_, point out the vowel sound /ie/, spelled ‘i’; for

the word _goose_, point out the vowel sound /oo/, spelled ‘oo.’


◦When you reach the multisyllable words ( _woman_, _person_ ), model for

students how to chunk each word into syllables, and say and spell each

word as you have done in previous lessons.


**Step 2: Forming Plurals of the Irregular Singular Nouns**


◦As you introduce each plural noun, write it in the table, pronouncing each

word as you write it.

◦Make sure to explicitly point out that this is the plural form of the noun.

Remind students that plural means more than one.


◦Point out that for some words, making the plural form adds a syllable

( _child_ is one syllable, while _children_ is two syllables).

**Challenge Word:** exercise


**Challenge Word:** laugh


- Explain that the Challenge Words, _exercise_ and _laugh_, are used very often. They

may not follow spelling patterns, and they need to be memorized.


- Explain to students that throughout this unit, _exercise_ is an academic

vocabulary word used as a noun but that it can also be used as a verb. Use this

Challenge Word in sentences as examples for students: “Please complete this

exercise to learn to spell.” “You exercise when you play soccer.”


- Write the word _laugh_ on the board, and tell students it is pronounced /laf/.


- Ask students to turn to page 3 of the Individual Code Chart, find the /a/ row,

and follow it across. Students will see that there is no ‘au’ listed because it is

a rare spelling of the /a/ sound. Use this Challenge Word in a sentence as an

example for students: “His new joke made me laugh out loud.”


- Tell students that on the assessment, you will say only the singular form of the

word, and will ask students to spell both the singular and plural forms of the

word. Emphasize that students will need to know whether the plural form is

regular or irregular in order to spell it correctly.


- Tell students they will not have to change the form of the Challenge Words on

the assessment.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


- Practice the words as follows during the remaining time. Call on a student

to read any word in its plural form and ask them to orally use the word in a

meaningful sentence. After the student says the sentence, have them ask the

class: “Did that sentence make sense?”


- If the class says, “Yes,” then the student puts a check mark in front of the word

and calls on another student to come to the front and take a turn. If the class

says, “No,” have the student try again, or call on another student to come to

the front and use the word in a meaningful sentence. This continues until all

the plural forms are used or time has run out.


- Tell students that the tables will remain on display until the assessment so

that they may refer to them during the week.


- Display the following words: _wolves_, _fee_, _babies_, _lives_, _arches_ .


- Tell students to decode the words in isolation and to apply what they have

learned about regular and irregular plural nouns.


**Note:** Distribute the decodable passage, “How Do Your Skeleton and Your

Joints Help You Walk?,” that you prepared in advance. Have students read

the decodable passage with a partner to practice decoding irregular singular

and plural nouns. As students read, circulate and provide informative and

corrective feedback.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


- Prepare to project the following digital images from the program’s online

materials during the Read-Aloud: U3.L2.1–U3.L2.8.


- Read the title of today’s Read-Aloud: “The Skeletal System: Axial Bones.”

Briefly review the systems discussed in the previous Read-Aloud, using any

image supports, including the KWL chart, as needed. Remind students that in

the previous Read-Aloud, they briefly heard about the skeletal system.


- Ask students, “What is the skeletal system made up of?”


» bones, joints, the skeleton


- Have students explain why the skeletal system is important to the human body.


» The skeleton supports the human body, and it protects important organs in the

human body.


- Remind students that in the _Classification of Animals_ unit, they learned about

a few ways animals are classified. One way that scientists group animals is by

whether or not they have a backbone. Ask students, “What are animals with

backbones called?”


» vertebrates


- Ask, “What are animals without backbones called?”


» invertebrates


- Ask students if humans and other mammals are vertebrates or invertebrates.


- Now ask students what they remember about exoskeletons, and then have a

few volunteers name some animals that have this hard protective covering.


» beetles and other insects, crustaceans such as crabs and crayfish


- Ask students, “Do we have an exoskeleton?”


- Tell students that today they will be hearing a special term that relates to

the skeletal system. Say the word _axial_, and ask students to repeat the word

after you.


- Write the word _axial_ on a piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard.

Ask students what word they see and/or hear in the word _axial_ .


» axis


- Remind students that they may have learned about Earth’s axis in several

previous units from earlier grades. Ask a volunteer to explain what an axis is.


» an imaginary straight line that goes through the center of an object, dividing it

equally into two parts


- Tell students that the axial bones are located up and down the middle of the

human body.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


- Have students feel for these axial bones on their own torsos and heads, and to

describe what they feel.


- Tell students to listen carefully to learn more about the axial bones in the

skeletal system. Ask them to predict how the axial bones work with other

bones and other parts of the body as an interconnected system.

Ricardo


Hi, everybody. Ricardo here—I’ve got a

new riddle for you:


_We are a column of bones, stacked on_

_top of one another. Collectively, we_

_make up your backbone. We begin with the letter ‘v.’ What are we?_


Today we’re going to talk about the system that gives your body

its structure, allowing it to stand on its own. If you’ve ever seen a

building being built, you know that it has a framework that gives the

building its shape and keeps it from toppling over. Your body has a

similar structure. Who knows what keeps your body from collapsing?

That’s right—your skeleton!


**Show Image U3.L2.2**
The human skeleton


Your skeleton is made of bones. Bones

can support a lot of weight, but they

did not start out that way. Before you

were born, your skeleton began as

cartilage, a firm rubbery tissue like the tough gristle on a piece of

meat. Touch the top of your ear. What you feel is cartilage. The top

of your ear will always be cartilage, but much of the cartilage in your

original skeleton hardened and turned to bone.

back as they consider

By the time you were born, you had about 300 bones in your body.

An adult has about 206 bones. So, where did all the extra bones go?

Do bones just disappear? No, they grow and change over time. Many

of them join together, like those at the end of your spine called the

tailbone, and the bones in your skull.


**Show Image U3.L2.3**
Dairy products and metallic calcium


Have you ever heard the saying “hard

as rock”? Rocks are hard due to the

minerals stored inside them. The

outside part of your bones becomes

hard by storing minerals, too. Minerals

enter your body in the food you eat and the vitamins you may take.

Calcium, contained in dark, leafy greens, broccoli, and dairy products,

such as milk, is one of the important minerals that makes your bones

as hard and strong as rock on the outside. Calcium is also needed to

help blood clot, or thicken, when you accidentally cut yourself. Without

it, your blood would be too thin for you to maintain good health.


At least until you reach your full height, your bones will continue to grow

with you. It’s hard to imagine rock-hard bones growing, isn’t it? They

cannot stretch or bend. So, how do bones grow? Well, bones are made

up of living tissue. New bone tissue is being made all the time, working

to replace worn-out cells and making it possible to heal broken bones.


**Show Image U3.L2.4**
Bone marrow


Before you were born, your bones were

solid, but many of them have become

hollow over time, making them very

light, yet still very strong. Bones are

porous, meaning they have many tiny holes through which liquids

pass. Marrow, a jellylike tissue, fills these cavities of your porous


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


bones. Bone marrow is your body’s blood cell factory. It produces

blood cells to fight infection and carry oxygen throughout your body.


Bones come in many shapes and sizes. Some are long and rodlike,

with knobby ends. Some are short and look like cubes, whereas others

are flat. And some have their own unique shapes. Even though there

are many different kinds and sizes of bones, all human skeletons look

pretty much the same. Your skeletal bones are designed in specific

ways to support and protect every part of your body.


**Show Image U3.L2.5**
Axial bones and individual vertebrae


There are three groups of bones

that form your axial skeleton: the

spine, skull, and ribs. The bones that

support the center of your body are

called axial bones. It is also the job of the axial bones to protect

the most important organs in your body. You’ve already learned

that taxonomists classify animals in two groups, vertebrates and

invertebrates. Who remembers the group in which humans are

classified? Right—we’re vertebrates! Vertebrates are animals with a

backbone. Your backbone, or spine, is actually more than one bone. It

is a column of many bones stacked on top of one another.


Bend forward and feel along the middle of your back. Do you remember

those little bumps running down your back? As you may have learned

in an earlier unit, these are your vertebrae, a series of bones fitted one

on top of another to form the spinal column, or backbone. Cartilage

separates each vertebra, filling in the spaces and cushioning them from

one another. Each vertebra has a hole in it, allowing the spinal cord, an

important pathway for nerves, to pass through it. Your spinal column

protects your spinal cord, in addition to providing the main support for

your skeleton. Your spine is only one part of your axial skeleton.


Sit up as straight and tall as you can. Now, look at your neighbor.

not. Your spine is curved, looking more like the letter ‘S’ than the

letter ‘I.’ The shape of your spine allows you much greater flexibility.

The curves help you with balance and flexibility as you move from one

position to the next, such as moving from standing to sitting.


**Show Image U3.L2.6**

Human skull showing interlocking bones


You’ve already heard about that

fabulous tailbone at the lower end of

your spine. So, what’s at the other

end? Use your hand to follow your

vertebrae up your back and along your

neck to your head. Feel how hard your head is. Who knows the name

for the protective group of bones hidden inside your head? Right—

your skull! Skull bones sit on top of your backbone, becoming the

second part of your axial skeleton, that group of bones that support

the center of your body.


Your skull comprises a group of bones—29 in all! Locked together,

they protect your brain and some of your body’s sensory organs. The

top part of your skull, shaped like a bowl and surrounding the brain,

is called the cranium. Eight thin, curved bones are tightly interlocked

to form this smooth cranial helmet beneath your forehead and

scalp. When you were born, these eight bones still had gaps between

them, allowing your brain to grow. Because these gaps don’t close

completely for about two years, babies have a “soft spot” on their

heads and need very careful handling.


The rest of your skull bones are facial bones, or bones in your face.

Put your hands over your eyes and touch your closed lids very gently,

pushing up slightly toward your eyebrows. The round openings in

your skull are called eye sockets. These sockets are deep enough to

protect your delicate eyes. Another hole in your skull is just the right

size for your nose. Though it is sometimes closed or covered up with

teeth, what is the biggest opening in your face? Right—your mouth.

Cover your face with your hands and open your mouth wide. Which


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


bone moved? Your jawbone! Your upper jaw is attached to the rest

of your skull, but your lower jaw is hinged so that it can move up and

down, and side to side. Pretty amazing, isn’t it?


Check for Understanding


Ask students why they think it is important for the jaw to be able to move.
Possible student responses: to chew food


**Show Image U3.L2.7**
Rib cage and flexible skeleton


Does anyone remember the three

groups of bones that form the axial

skeleton down the center of your

body? The spine is one. The skull is

another. The third group of axial bones is also connected to your

spine. Reach behind you again and feel the bones that stretch across

your back, wrapping around to the front of your body. What are these

bones called? Right again—your ribs!


Ribs are curved bones that form a protective cage, called the rib cage,

around your heart and lungs. Ribs come in pairs. Each rib is attached to a

vertebra in the middle of your back, and the sternum, or breastbone, in the

middle of your chest. Feel your chest. Can you count the number of ribs in

your rib cage? How many did you count? You have 24 ribs, or 12 pairs, in all.


I just can’t resist sharing a joke with you right now because it fits in

so well with what you’re learning:


_What did the rib cage say to the heart?_

_Give up?_

_Gotcha covered!_


Your skull and ribs both protect vital organs, organs that you cannot

live without. However, your ribs are designed very differently from

your skull. Whereas your skull is made of solid, interconnected bones

without spaces between, there are spaces between each of your ribs

which are filled with muscle tissue. Can anyone guess why it wouldn’t

work for the rib cage to be one big, solid bone? Take a deep breath,

as deep as you can. Now, let the air out. What happens to your chest?

Do it again and notice how your chest goes in and out with each

breath that you take. Solid bone around your chest would prevent the

diaphragm and lungs from expanding properly with the air you breathe.

The shape of the spine and the spaces filled with muscle in between

each pair of ribs, helps the human body structure to be flexible.

part of your skeletal system, and to

your arms and legs. I’m looking forward to the next time we meet! I’ll

be sure to have new riddles!


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** You heard in the Read-Aloud that when you were born, you had

about 300 bones in your body. What happened to the bones?


» Bones grow and change over time. Many of them joined together, like the skull

bones and tailbone.


2. **Inferential.** How do bones heal and grow?


» They are made of marrow, living cells, and tissues that replace worn-out cells.


3. **Inferential.** Explain why the skeletal system is so important.


» The bones give the human body its structure, allowing it to stand up on its own. It

also protects vital organs.


4. **Inferential.** Why is it important for bones to be porous? What is inside bones?


» Porous bones are lighter, and marrow, a jellylike tissue, fills the cavities of the bones.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


5. **Inferential.** Why is bone marrow important?


» It produces blood cells that help to fight infections, carry oxygen throughout the

body, and allow bones to grow.


6. **Inferential.** Why are the spaces filled with muscle tissue in between your rib

cage and the slight bend of your spine important?


» They allow the skeletal system to be flexible.


~~**WORD WORK: STRUCTURE (10 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _structure_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity for

students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. Review

syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Today we’re going to talk about the system that

gives your body its structure, allowing it to stand on its own.”


3. Say the word _structure_ with me.


4. A structure is a form or shape, or something that is made up of a number of

parts arranged together.


5. A house built in an area where earthquakes are common should have a

structure that resists the force of an earthquake.


6. In the Read-Aloud, you heard why it is important for the body to have a strong

structure. What are some other things that could not exist without a strong

structure? Be sure to use the word _structure_ when you talk about it. (Ask

two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’

responses to make complete sentences: “Without a strong structure, ___

could not exist.”)


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the

word _structure_ ?


 - Use a Sharing activity for follow-up. Directions: Turn to your partner and take

turns sharing ideas about the ways in which the body’s structure is similar to

a building’s structure. Also take turns with your partner sharing ideas about

the ways in which your body’s structure is different from a building’s structure.

I will call on one or two of you to share your ideas with the class. As students

share, make sure they use the word _structure_ in a complete sentence.

a copy of a two-paragraph report that Mr. Mowse created for them.


- Read the title of the activity page and explain that a report is a piece of

writing about a nonfiction topic. Tell students that Mr. Mowse started writing

his report and, while he remembered some really good information about

classifying animals, he had difficulty organizing his thoughts, so he needs

some help from the class. Tell students that writing is difficult for Mr. Mowse,

and his letter took him a long time to write.


- Tell students that the sentences on the front of the Activity Page are all from

the same paragraph. There are six sentences: One is a topic sentence, one is

a concluding sentence, and the rest are sentences that provide supporting

details for the topic sentence. However, the sentences are not in the

proper order.


- Ask students to read all of the sentences aloud as a group, thinking in

particular about which sentence might be the topic sentence. After a brief

discussion, have all students mark the topic sentence as ‘TS.’


- Next, ask students to identify and mark the concluding sentence as ‘CS.’

Remind students that the concluding sentence is often a restatement of the

topic sentence. Remind students that the concluding sentence is the very last

sentence in a properly sequenced paragraph.


- Finally, tell students that the remaining sentences are all details supporting

the topic sentence. Ask them to number the remaining sentences in a logical

order so that they make sense.


- Summarize by having students reread the sentences of the paragraph in the

correct order, for example, topic sentence, supporting details in proper order,

- Briefly review the human body systems discussed in previous Read-Alouds.

Review the major body systems introduced in Lesson 1. Remind students that

cells are the building blocks of life.


Check for Understanding


Share any information you recall about the cells, tissues, and organs in
the body.

» Answers may vary.


Do our human body systems work independently, or are they
interconnected?

» They are interconnected.


Share what you remember about the bones in your skeletal system.

» Answers may vary.


Ask students to recall what term they learned to describe the skull, spine,
and rib cage.

» axial bones


Why are the skull, spine, and rib cage called axial bones?

» The axial bones in the human body support the center of the body.


Explain why, in addition to supporting the body, the axial bones are
important.

» They protect the most important organs in the body.


Why is the skeletal system as a whole important to the human body?

» The skeleton is a framework that keeps the body from toppling over.


- Tell students that today they will continue to learn about the skeletal system.

Revisit the ‘W’ section of the KWL chart, and ask students if there is anything

else they wonder about the skeletal system that they would like to add before

hearing the Read-Aloud.


- Tell students that today they will hear about different types of bones and

joints. Ask students to predict what the largest bone in the human body

is and where it is located. Ask students to predict what the strongest joint

in the human body is and where it is located. You may wish to record their

responses on the KWL chart and address the responses while discussing the

Read-Aloud section.

Ricardo


Hello again. Before we begin, I want to

know who is able to correctly spell the

big ‘v’ word that we talked about the

last time we met. Who would like to try

to spell _vertebrae_ ? Wow! I’m impressed.


Today we’re going to talk about another big word: _appendages_ . I was

quite small the first time I ever heard that word. I used to cling to my

mother’s leg all the time, and I would often hear her say, “Ricardo is

my little appendage.” I never knew what it meant. Do you? Now, years

later, it makes perfect sense to me. An appendage is something that

is attached to, or that hangs from, something larger. Today, you are

going to learn about the other bones in your skeletal system, the

bones in the legs and arms that hang from your axial skeleton. These

bones in your appendages are called appendicular bones because

they “hang on” to the larger bones of the body. Let’s try saying those

words together: _appendicular bones_ .

Highlighted scapulae


Let’s begin near the top of your skeleton

with your arm bones. What are your

arms attached to? What do they hang

down from? If you answered shoulders,

you are right. Your shoulders are made up of several different bones. Look

at this picture to see how arm bones are connected to the axial skeleton.

The large, flat, triangular bones that you see in the picture are called

scapulae, or shoulder blades. They are sometimes referred to as “wings”

because they stick out a little from your back. Now, look at this picture.

The long bones that connect your scapulae to the top of your rib cage are

called clavicles, or collarbones. Shirt collars cover your collarbones.

What are examples of appendages?

» Answers may vary.


**Show Image U3.L3.3**
Leg bones attached to skeleton


Let’s move down your body to the base

of your axial skeleton. How are your

legs attached to your spine? Legs need

a hanger, too. Their hanger is called the

pelvis, a group of strong bones illustrated in this picture. Put your hands

on your hips and feel for the bones that stick out at your sides. These

are your hip bones, or pelvic bones. Your pelvic bones are large bowl
shaped bones that protect your bladder and intestines—very important

organs that help your body function properly. Your pelvis is connected

to your spine by the sacrum, a triangular bone that sits between the two

hipbones of your pelvis.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


**Show Image U3.L3.4**
Tibia, fibula, and femur


Leg bones and arm bones are a lot

alike, but leg bones are thicker and

longer than arm bones. In fact, the

longest, heaviest, and strongest bone

in your entire body is in your leg. Does

anyone know the name of this bone? It’s your thighbone, or femur.

Your femur is connected to your pelvis and extends all the way down

to your knee. If you look at the picture, you will see two bones in the

lower part of the leg. The larger of the two, the one in the front of

the leg, is called the tibia, or shinbone. The thinner bone behind it is

called the fibula. Both the tibia and the fibula connect the knee to the

ankle.


That’s a lot of information. I suspect that some of you are wondering

how all these different bones are connected. Sure, they’re attached to

hangers, the scapulae, and the pelvis, but how? Are they glued in place?


**Show Image U3.L3.5**
Different types of joints (movable,
immovable, partially movable)


The point where two bones meet is called

a joint. Without joints, your body would

not be able to move. There are three main

types of joints in your body: movable,

immovable, and partially movable. In other words, some joints can move,

some can’t, and some move a little bit. Let’s take a closer look at all three.


The most movable joints in your body are ball-and-socket joints.

Make a fist with one hand; then, wrap the fingers of your other hand

around it. Your fist is like the ball in the socket of your other hand. You

can move the fist around easily inside the other hand, can’t you? This


Lesson 3 The Skeletal System: All About Bones, Part 1
**65**


Challenge


Have students consider
what it would be like to
walk and move without
joints (e.g., it would mean
walking around very
stiffly and not being able
to bend over).


Support


Have students stand up
and try to do activities
without bending or using
their movable joints.


**66**



type of joint is found in both your hips and shoulders. Ball-and-socket

joints allow you to swing your arms and legs in a full circle.


Check for Understanding


Where do we find ball-and-socket joints?

» in your hips and shoulders


Other movable joints, called hinge joints, work like the hinges of a

door. Your jawbone has hinges. Can you think of any other hinge

joints in your body, joints that move only back and forth instead of

turning in a full circle? Your knees, elbows, ankles, and knuckles all

have hinge joints. In fact, your knee joint, connecting your femur to

your tibia and fibula, is the biggest and strongest joint in your whole

body. It lets your body bend at the knees. Stand up and bend at the

knees. Imagine trying to walk without those hinge joints!


Check for Understanding


How are joints like hinges?

» They move back and forth instead of in a circle.


Some joints permit no movement at all. These are called immovable

joints because they lock bones together, forming solid bone as

hard as a turtle shell. Can you think of any axial bones that fit that

description? Yes, your skull is made up of bones that are locked firmly

in place, allowing no movement where the bones come together.


The third type of joint in your body is the partially movable kind, the

ones that move a little bit but not nearly as much as ball-and-socket or

hinge joints. Can anyone think of an example of a partially movable joint

in your body? Remember when you took deep breaths and watched

your chest move in and out? The joints where your ribs are joined to

your breastbone are a good example of partially movable joints.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


**Show Image U3.L3.6**
Cartilage and ligaments


Remember cartilage, the soft, gristly

tissue found in your nose and backbone

and between your vertebrae? Cartilage

is found at the ends of bones where

they connect with joints as well. This

smooth, elastic tissue serves an important purpose. Rub your palms

together. Do you feel the heat? If bones and joints rubbed back and

forth together like this with nothing in between, your bones would soon

wear out. Instead, a smooth, slippery coating of cartilage covers bones

where they meet at the joints, protecting them and helping them to last

longer.


That makes me think of a riddle:


_We are tough straps of strong, elastic tissue that bind bones_

_together. Our name has three syllables and comes from a word_

_meaning “to tie.” What are we?_


Cartilage protects your bones from rubbing together, but another

connective tissue acts like straps, wrapping around your joints to

actually hold your bones together. These thick cords are called

ligaments. Some are round like ropes; others are flat like ribbons. But

they are all extremely stretchy. Has anyone ever told you that he or

she is double-jointed? Double-jointed people can bend their fingers

farther back than other people, but they don’t really have extra joints.

The ligaments holding their joints together just stretch farther than

normal. Is anyone here “double-jointed”?


Check for Understanding


What is the difference between cartilage and ligaments?

» Cartilage covers bones where they meet joints, and ligaments act

like straps that actually hold your bones together.


Lesson 3 The Skeletal System: All About Bones, Part 1
**67**


**68**



Ligaments and other protective tissues help prevent injuries to your

bones. Nevertheless, bones still get injured and wear out. Humans

are very active. Walking, running, jumping, and playing puts stress

on your bones. So, what happens if you break a leg, sprain an ankle,

or dislocate a joint? Often, you must see a doctor, and sometimes

your doctor will recommend an x-ray. Now that you have lots of

information about the skeletal system, both the axial bones and the

appendicular bones, let’s take a look at this thing we call an x-ray.


**Show Image U3.L3.7**
X-ray


These x-rays are of various parts

of a human skeleton. An x-ray is an

invisible light that can travel through

the soft tissues of your body, but

not through hard bone. After an x-ray passes through you, a picture

is recorded on photographic film. Soft tissues appear black on the

film because the x-ray passes right through them. But, wherever the

x-ray is blocked by bone, white areas appear on the picture, allowing

doctors to find breaks more easily. X-rays were invented as a medical

tool just over 120 years ago.


**Show Image U3.L3.8**
Ricardo


The next time we meet, we’ll discuss

another important body system, one

that works closely with your skeletal

system to move your bones. Turn now

and talk to your neighbor. See if you

agree on the name of the system I’m talking about. Next time, we’ll

find out if you’re right!


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Were your predictions correct about the largest bone and the

strongest joint? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


**Show Image U3.L3.4**
Tibia, fibula, and femur


2. **Inferential.** What is the difference between the three types of joints?


» Movable joints, like ball-and-socket joints and hinge joints, help different body

parts, such as the knees and shoulders, bend easily; immovable joints lock bones

in place, like the joints that connect the bones in the skull; partially movable joints,

such as the rib cage, allow for some movement, but not as much movement as the

movable joints.


3. **Inferential.** Why is cartilage important to the joints?


» Cartilage covering the bones at the joints protects the bones, helping them to

last longer.


4. **Inferential.** What would happen if there was no cartilage at the joints?


» Bones would more easily become worn down.


5. **Evaluative.** Would ligaments still be able to do their job if the tissues that

they are made of were not stretchy and connective?


» Answers may vary.


6. **Evaluative.** Why do you think it is more common to break an appendicular

bone than an axial bone?


» Appendicular bones are more vulnerable because they are more exposed, used

often to move about and play, etc.


7. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ If your body were a tree, which parts of the tree

would be your appendicular bones? Which parts would be the axial bones?


» Answers may vary but may include that appendicular would include the limbs,

branches, and leaves; and axial would include the trunk.

 - **Exit Ticket:** Ask students to respond in writing to the following three

questions as an exit ticket formative assessment:


1. What are the three types of joints? (movable, immovable, partially

movable)


2. How do the joints function? (Joints connect bones; some allow movement

while others do not.)


3. How does the skeletal system interact with the rest of the body? (The

skeletal system is a framework for the whole body.)


   - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all

assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


~~**WORD WORK: APPENDAGES (10 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _appendages_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity

for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. Review

syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard Ricardo say, “Today we’re going to talk about

another big word: _appendages_ . I used to cling to my mother’s leg all the time,

and I would often hear her say, ‘Ricardo is my little appendage.’”


3. Say the word _appendages_ with me.


4. Appendages are smaller body parts attached to the main body.


5. Spiders are able to crawl around quickly with their eight appendages.


6. How many appendages do insects and other animals have? What else can you

think of that has appendages? Be sure to use the word _appendages_ when you

tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase

the students’ responses to make complete sentences: “A has

appendages.”).


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the

word _appendages_ ?


 - Acting and Sharing Activity:


    - Directions: Turn to your partner and make a motion with one of your

appendages. Ask your partner to describe what you are demonstrating

with one of your appendages. For example, you may use your arm to


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


pretend to wave to a friend. You would ask your partner, “What am I

doing with one of my appendages?” Your partner would reply, “You are

using one of your appendages to wave hello.” I will ask one or two of you

to share with the class what action you were demonstrating with one of

your appendages. As you share, be sure to use the word _appendages_ in a

complete sentence.


~~**SKELETAL SYSTEM REVIEW (10 MIN.)**~~


- As a class, briefly review the skeletal system, including the terms _axial bones_

and _appendicular bones._ Using Images U3.L3.1–U3.L3.8, have students

identify the different bones in the skeletal system. You may also review

this content by showing images from the Read-Alouds on the skeletal

system again.


- Give each student a copy of Activity Page 3.1. After students have labeled the

parts of the skeleton, have them circle one example of an axial bone and put

a square around one example of an appendicular bone. If time allows, have

students locate the different types of bones and joints on their own bodies.


**Note:** You may wish to have some students complete this activity as a class,

or have students work in groups or with a partner.


- Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all

assignments in this unit. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.D]**~~

identifies the word as
“knives” and then says
another sentence with
another irregular plural.

 - Prompt students to come to the board to decode the plural form while the rest

of the students write the singular form of the word on a paper or whiteboards.

Students can also read the singular form while the rest of the students write

the plural form of the word on paper or whiteboards.


 - While students work, circulate and provide informative feedback. Discuss any

misconceptions students may have regarding the correct spelling of words.


 - **Challenge** Provide students with series of jumbled words that include extra

“decoy” letters. The first jumble has one extra letter, the second jumble has

two extra letters, etc. Make sure that students know how many extra “decoy”

letters each jumbled word has. Consider a maximum number of three

decoy letters.

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD: “THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U3.L5.1**
Ricardo


Hi, guys. It’s me, Ricardo. Last time we

were together, I told you that our next

discussion would be about a system

that works extremely well with your

skeletal system. Did any of you predict

the name of the system we’re going to talk about today? If you

predicted the muscular system, you’re correct! You’ve learned how

the bones in your skeletal system are connected from head to toe.

Bones form the important framework of your body, but they could

not move without the help of your **muscles.**


**Show Image U3.L5.2**
Muscles and muscle fibers


What are muscles? The word

_muscle_ comes from the Latin word

_musculous_ . Muscles are made up of

bundles of long, thin cells. They are

controlled by signals that come from

your brain and spinal cord, which carry messages through **nerves**

to every part of your body. Muscles receive these messages, telling

them when to contract, or tighten, how to **contract,** and for how

long. When muscles contract, they squeeze together, shortening and

causing movement. Muscles are at work in your body all the time,

even while you are sleeping. You have more than 650 muscles in your

body, making up between one-third and one-half of your body weight.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


Check for Understanding


Stand up if the statement is true, and stay seated if the statement is false.
Muscles are made up of bundles of long, thin cells.

» True


Muscles are controlled by signals from your feet.

» False


Muscles go to sleep when you go to sleep.

» False


There are three types of muscles in your body, but most of them

are skeletal muscles. Your skeletal muscles work closely with your

bones to give them mobility, or motion. Just as there are axial bones

and appendicular bones, there are axial muscles and appendicular

muscles. Which muscles do you think are axial? Right—the ones in

your head, neck, and torso. And where are the appendicular muscles

located? Yes! In your arms and legs.


**Show Image U3.L5.3**
Arm muscles


Most muscles work in pairs. Muscles

only pull on bone; they cannot push.

As your muscles pull on bone, they

contract, or get shorter. In order to

relax, or lengthen, muscles need a

partner to pull the bone in the opposite direction. Paired muscles

never pull at the same time. One pulls, the other relaxes. One relaxes,

the other pulls.


Look at this picture of the muscles in your upper arm. It shows

what happens when you make a fist and bend your arm. The biceps

muscle contracts and bends your elbow, while your triceps muscle

relaxes. When you straighten your arm out again, your triceps muscle

contracts and your biceps muscle relaxes. By working in pairs, taking

turns pulling on your bones, skeletal muscles enable you to ride a

bike, play the guitar, or climb a mountain.


Skeletal muscles come in all sorts of shapes and sizes—fat and skinny,

long and circular. Because you control your skeletal muscles, deciding

when and how you want to move your bones, they are called **voluntary**

muscles. The movement does not happen automatically. You make a

conscious decision to move the muscles attached to your bones.


**Show Image U3.L5.4**
Leg muscles and Achilles tendon


Narrow, rope-like tissues called tendons

attach bones to muscles. You can see

the tendons under your skin if you flex

your arm back and forth. Try it. Bend

your elbow as if you wanted to show off

your muscles, and feel the tendon just under the skin on the inside of

your elbow. What are other good places to view your tendons in action?

Look at your neighbor’s neck. Can you find the tendons as he turns his

head? Can you find tendons in your arms or legs?


The muscles in your legs are the largest and strongest skeletal

muscles in your body. One of these muscles is your calf muscle. Feel

your calf muscle at the back of your lower leg. It is responsible for

much of your movement between the lower leg and foot, helping to

bend your knee when you walk or run. It is attached to your heel bone

by the longest and most powerful tendon in your body, the Achilles

tendon.


If your Achilles tendon is cut or torn, the use of the leg for jumping

and running is lost immediately until it heals. The tendon is named

for an ancient Greek mythological figure who can only be injured at

the ankle. Its variant, “Achilles’ heel,” is a figurative phrase indicating

our weak spots, places where we feel most likely to be hurt, either

physically or emotionally.

Types of muscles and muscle cells


In addition to skeletal muscle, there is

smooth muscle and **cardiac muscle.**

Are you ready for another riddle?


_I am a muscle. Like music, I have a rhythm and a beat. I am protected_

_by the rib cage. What am I?_


Does anyone know what type of muscle is contained in your heart—

smooth or cardiac? Your thick, powerful heart is made of cardiac

muscle, the hardest working muscle in your body, found only in your

heart. Unlike skeletal muscle, healthy cardiac muscle never tires. It

is continually contracting and relaxing, rhythmically pumping blood

around your body all day and all night. Cardiac muscle is an involuntary

muscle, meaning that you do not control its movement. Your brain

controls how fast your heart beats without you even thinking about it.

Why do you think that is important?


Smooth muscle is the third type of muscle in your body. It is also

involuntary muscle because you cannot consciously move it. It contracts

much more slowly, using less energy than skeletal muscles. Smooth

muscle is the muscle that squeezes and tightens in the digestive

tract,your blood vessels, and your bladder.


**Show Image U3.L5.6**
Ricardo


The next time we meet, we’ll talk about

the system that controls all your other

body systems. This system controls

both the voluntary and involuntary

muscles in your body, and much more.

Can you guess what system it is? We’ll see if you’ve guessed correctly!

~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** Why is the muscular system important to the body?


» It helps the body move and do other things that we can’t see, like the stomach and

intestines helping to digest food and the heart pumping blood. It is the framework

of the human body, together with the skeletal system.


2. **Inferential.** In the Read-Aloud, you heard that muscles work in pairs. What

does that mean?


» Because muscles only pull on bone, one muscle needs another muscle to pull a

bone in the opposite direction when it wants to move. One muscle pulls while the

other relaxes. The paired muscle relaxes while the other pulls.


3. **Inferential.** How do the skeletal muscles work closely with the skeleton to

help us move?


» Skeletal muscles are attached to the bones in the skeleton, the body’s framework.

Skeletal muscles are voluntary, so when we make the decision to move, it is the

skeletal muscles that help the skeleton move.


~~**WORD WORK: VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the words _voluntary_ and _involuntary_ on the board in cursive and provide

an opportunity for students to apply decoding skills prior to the words being

discussed. Review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard, “Because you control your skeletal muscles,

deciding when and how you want to move your bones, they are called voluntary

muscles.” You also heard, “Cardiac muscle is an involuntary muscle, meaning

that you do not control its movement.”


3. Say the words _voluntary muscles_ and _involuntary muscles_ with me.


4. _Voluntary muscles_ are those that can be controlled by someone’s own choice;

_involuntary muscles_ are those that are not controlled by choice.


5. I use the voluntary muscles in my legs to jump high in the air, but my heart is

an involuntary muscle because I don’t do anything to make it contract—it does

that on its own!


6. What are some examples of voluntary muscles? Can you think of examples

of involuntary muscles? Be sure to use the words _voluntary muscles_ and

_involuntary muscles_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to make complete

sentences: “ is an example of a voluntary muscle, and is an

example of an involuntary muscle.”)


7. What are the words we’ve been talking about? What part of speech are the

words _voluntary muscles_ and _involuntary muscles_ ?


 - Use a Word Parts activity for follow-up. Write the words _voluntary_ and

_involuntary_ on a piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard.


 - Ask students, “What is the difference between the words _voluntary_ and

_involuntary_ ?


» the prefix _in–_


 - “How does adding the prefix _in–_ to _voluntary_ change that word?”


» It makes it mean the opposite of _voluntary_ .


 - Directions: I am going to say a word and ask you to tell me what it means. If

you do not know, I will help you. Then I would like you to add the prefix _in–_

to the word and tell me what that new word means.

back through the list slowly, reading each word just once more.


 - Ask students to write the following sentences as you dictate them:


1. He helped his children brush their teeth before bed.


2. The woman lost her glasses, so she could not read the stories.


 - Then, ask students to go back and write the plural form of each singular

noun. Allow students 5–10 minutes to complete this portion of the spelling

assessment.


 - After students have finished, collect pens, if used.


 - Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.


 - Tell students that you will now show them the correct spelling for each word so

they can correct their own work using a pencil.


 - Say and write each word on the board. Instruct students to correct their work

by crossing out any incorrect spelling, then copying and writing the correct

spelling next to it.


 - Continue through all the words and then on to the dictated sentences.

any patterns that are beginning to develop, or that are persistent among

individual students.


~~**SPELLING: PRACTICE ALPHABETIZING SKILLS (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.C**~~


 - Using the previously prepared spelling cards folded over to reveal just the

first letter, tape the words on the board randomly. Tell students that you will

now review how to alphabetize the spelling words and Challenge Words on the

board to the third letter.


 - Ask students, “Look at the first letter on each card taped on the board. Of all

the letters displayed on the board, which one comes first in the alphabet?”

Students should respond ‘b’. Tape this card, still folded, to the board at the top

of a column that you will create of the words.


 - Ask students, “Look at the first letter on each of the remaining cards. Of all

the letters displayed on the remaining cards, which one comes next in the

alphabet?” Students should respond ‘c’. Tape this card, still folded, to the

board below the card with the ‘b’ displayed.


 - Ask students, “Look at the first letter on each of the remaining cards. Of all

the letters displayed on the remaining cards, which one comes next in the

alphabet?” Students should respond ‘e’. Tape this card, still folded, to the

board below the card ‘c’.


 - Ask students, “Look at the first letter on each of the remaining cards. Of all

the letters displayed on the remaining cards, which one comes next in the

alphabet?” Students should respond ‘f’. Students should notice that there

are two cards with the letter ‘f’ displayed. Unfold and then refold each card to

reveal the second letter, e.g., the ‘o’ in fox and the ‘o’ in foot. Students should

notice that there are two cards with the second letter ‘o’. Unfold and then

refold each card to reveal the third letter. Ask students which of these two

letters, ‘x’ or ‘o’, comes first. They should respond ‘o’. Tape the ‘foo’ card, still

folded, to the board below the ‘e’ displayed. Then, tape the ‘fox’ card below the

card with ‘foo’ displayed.


 - Ask students, “Look at the first letter on each of the remaining cards. Of all

the letters displayed on the remaining cards, which one comes next in the

alphabet?” Students should respond ‘g’. Students should notice that there

are two cards with the letter ‘g’ displayed. Unfold and then refold each card to

reveal the second letter, e.g., the ‘l’ in glass and the ‘o’ in goose. Ask students

which of these two letters, ‘l’ or ‘o’, comes first. They should respond ‘l’. Tape

the ‘gl’ card, still folded, to the board below the card with ‘fox’ displayed. Then,

tape the card with ‘go’ below the ‘gl’ card.


**TEKS 3.2.C** Alphabetize a series of words to the third letter.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


- Ask students, “Look at the first letter on each of the remaining cards. Of all

the letters displayed on the remaining cards, which one comes next in the

alphabet?” Students should respond ‘l’. Students should notice that there

are two cards with the letter ‘l’ displayed. Unfold and then refold each card to

reveal the second letter, e.g., the ‘a’ in laugh and the ‘o’ in louse. Ask students

which of these two letters, ‘a’ or ‘o’, comes first. They should respond ‘a’. Tape

the ‘la’ card, still folded, to the board below the card with ‘go’ displayed. Then,

tape the card with ‘lo’ below the ‘la’ card. Ask students, “Look at the first letter

on each of the remaining cards. Of all the letters displayed on the remaining cards,

which one comes next in the alphabet?” Students should then notice that there

are three cards with the letter ‘m’ displayed. Unfold and then refold each card to

reveal the second letter, e.g., the ‘o’ in mouse and the ‘a’ in man and match. Ask

students which of these two letters, ‘o’ or ‘a’, comes first. They should respond ‘a’.

Unfold and then refold both of these cards to reveal the third letter, e.g., the ‘n’ in

man and the ‘t’ in match. Ask students which of these two letters, ‘n’ or ‘t’, comes

first. Students should respond ‘n’. Tape the card with ‘man’ displayed to the board

below the ‘lo’ card. Then, tape the ‘mat’ card below ‘man’. Finally, tape the ‘mo’

card below the card with ‘mat’ displayed.


- Continue in this way until you have alphabetized all of the cards.


- When you have completed this, unfold all the cards so that the entire word

is visible.


- Read the words aloud with students and state explicitly that all the spelling

words are now in alphabetical order on the board.

Take-Home Material


 - Have students take home Activity Page 5.3 to read to a family member.


~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


 - Students are likely to make the following errors:


    - For irregular plurals, writing the plural form incorrectly since there is no

pattern to follow


    - For some regular plurals, adding _–s_ instead of _–es_


    - For some regular plurals, not changing ‘y’ to ‘i’ before adding _–es_


 - While any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still

be aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find

it helpful to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the

analysis chart. For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning

consonants?


 - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


 - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization and

punctuation.


 - Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

~~**DISCUSSING THE READING (30 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Discussion questions should be limited to 15 minutes so students

have time to complete Activity Page 6.1.


1. **Literal.** Which is more flexible, muscle or cartilage, and why?


» Muscle. Cartilage is not as hard as bone, but it is stiffer and less flexible

than muscle.


2. **Literal.** What does cartilage do in your spinal cord, and why is that

important?


» Cartilage cushions the vertebrae and keeps them from rubbing against each

other. Cartilage keeps the vertebrae from damaging each other and/or the spinal

cord.


3. **Literal.** Where would you find cartilage in your ear?


» in the part of your ear that is on the outside of your head


4. **Literal.** What are ligaments and why are they important?


» They are a kind of tissue that connects bones together. They also hold

joints together.


5. **Literal.** What are tendons and what do they do?


» tough bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones


6. **Literal.** What would happen if you didn’t have tendons?


» Answers may vary, but could include that your body would have a hard time

moving since your muscles would not be connected to your bones, which is how

bones are able to move.


7. **Inferential.** What is the key idea of this chapter?


» Students may not exactly state the key idea like this, but it should closely

resemble the following: Joints are where two bones are joined together, and they

are cushioned by cartilage. Tendons connect muscles to bones.

**Primary Focus:** Students will correctly change ‘f’ to ‘v’ and add _–es_ in plural

nouns. ~~**TEKS 3.2.B.vii; TEKS 3.11.D.iii**~~


Students will decode words using knowledge of syllable division patterns. ~~**TEKS 3.2.A.vi**~~


~~**INTRODUCING SPELLING WORDS (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Display the Spelling Chart or project Digital Projection DP.U3.L6.1. If you have

decided to reveal the words progressively, make sure to use the cover sheet

you prepared.


 - When introducing the words, use these procedures:


Step 1: Introducing the Singular Nouns


 - Tell students that this week, they will be working with more nouns and their

plural forms. While there is a pattern to follow to make these words plural,

these words are rare.


**TEKS 3.2.B.vii** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling words using knowledge of suffixes, including how they
can change base words such as dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling final consonants; **TEKS 3.11.D.iii** Edit drafts using
standard English conventions, including: singular, plural, common, and proper nouns; **TEKS 3.2.A.vi** Demonstrate and apply
phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCV with
accent shifts. Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


- Tell students that for this week’s assessment, they will be responsible for

writing the singular and plural forms of the nouns.


- As you introduce each of the spelling words, point it out in the table,

pronouncing it as you point out or reveal it.


- Point out the vowel sound(s) and spellings in the word to students.


Step 2: Forming Plurals of the Singular Nouns


- Tell students that the right side of the table shows the plural form of each

singular noun.


- Explain the rules for making these nouns plural. For words that end in ‘ _fe_ ’,

change the ‘ _f_ ’ to ‘ _v_ ’, drop the ‘ _e_ ’, and then add – _es_ . For words that end with ‘ _f_ ’,

the ‘ _f_ ’ must be changed to ‘ _v_ ’ before adding – _es_ .


- Explain to students that the Challenge Words _before_ and _please_ are words that

are used very often. They may not follow spelling patterns, and need to be

memorized. Use the Challenge Words in sentences as examples for students:

“You need to eat your dinner before you have ice cream.” “Please let me go to

the park.”


- Tell students they will not need to change the form of the Challenge Words on

the assessment.


- Have students also practice applying the spelling rules of changing _f to v_,

dropping the _e_, and adding _–es_ . Words ending in “f” must be changed to

“v” before adding _–es_ . Select 10-11 of the words for students to read in the

singular and plural form and use in a sentence (including challenge words).

Dictate the singular form of the additional words and have students write to

apply the rules to create the plural form. While students work, circulate and

provide informative feedback to address any misconceptions. After, have

students write an original sentence using one of the words correctly and have

them share it with the whole group.


- Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.


- Prompt students to practice spelling this week’s challenge words: _before_

and _please_ . Write the words on the board in cursive and have students come

up and decode them using syllable patterns. Have students say each word,

practice writing it, and then share a sentence with a partner using the word.


- Tell students that the table will remain on display until the assessment so that

they may refer to it during the week.


**Note:** Distribute the decodable passage, “How Do Your Skeleton and Your

Joints Help You Walk?,” that you prepared in advance to practice decoding

irregular singular and plural nouns. While students are reading, circulate and

provide immediate corrective feedback as needed.

**Primary Focus:** Students will create a piece of writing that includes a topic and

concluding sentence. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.12.B**~~


~~**TOPIC AND CONCLUDING SENTENCES (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that in previous lessons, they worked on finding the topic

sentence and concluding sentence for a paragraph, and writing their own

with partners.


 - Reread with the students the Paragraph chart that you created, or project

Digital Projection DP.U3.L5.1.

) **Projection DP.U3.L5.1**










 - Tell students that today, they will work on writing a paragraph as a class.

Tell students that a topic sentence will be provided. They will write supporting

detail sentences and a concluding sentence.


 - Write the following sentence on the board: “I like winter.”


 - Remind students that all the sentences in the paragraph must be about

liking winter.


 - Remind students that the last sentence should wrap up, or conclude, the

paragraph and should not have new information.


 - Take a few minutes to generate possible sentences about winter from students.


 - As each sentence is suggested, ask students, “Does this sentence say

something about liking winter?”


 - Record these sentences on the board. Help students sequence the order in which

the sentences should be written by numbering the sentences on the board.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words; **TEKS**
**3.12.B** Compose informational texts, including brief compositions that convey information about a topic, using a clear central
idea and genre characteristics and craft.

Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


- After you have five to six sentences to choose from, write the sentences in

paragraph form either on the board, document camera surface, or overhead

projector. If one of the sentences could serve as a wrap-up for the paragraph,

write it last. If not, have students write a good concluding sentence. As you

write, point out to students when you are indenting, using capital letters,

correct punctuation, etc.


- Summarize this exercise by noting that all the sentences are about the topic

sentence, i.e., liking winter, and that the last sentence wraps up or concludes

the paragraph without introducing new information.


- Using the Paragraph poster you displayed in advance, remind students that

they have been learning about writing paragraphs. They have learned that

a good paragraph has a topic sentence that gives the key idea, or what the

paragraph is mostly about. A good paragraph also includes sentences that

provide details that support the topic sentence.


- Ask students to turn to Activity Page 6.2. Explain that this activity page

includes a topic sentence.


- Then, ask them to brainstorm ideas for appropriate details that might be

included in the paragraph.


- Tell students that a good paragraph also includes a concluding sentence at the

end of the paragraph. A good concluding sentence wraps things up and often

is a restatement of the topic sentence.


- Ask students to suggest ideas for a concluding sentence for this paragraph.

Review the ideas with students.


- If needed, help rephrase student ideas. Review the list of ideas, eliminating any

that may not be appropriate.


- Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

How are the skeletal system and the muscular system interconnected?


» Answers may vary.


Name the other systems you have heard about that are interconnected
with the muscular system.


» the nervous system and the digestive system


Share what you remember about the different types of muscles and where
they are located in the human body.


» Answers will vary, but may include details about the skeletal

muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle.


What is the difference between voluntary and involuntary muscles? Can
you name examples of each?


» Voluntary muscles are muscles that are consciously moved, like

our leg muscles, and involuntary muscles are muscles we don’t

really think about, like our heart.


- Review that cells are the building blocks of life.


- Encourage students to explain that the different types of cells make up the

tissues that are part of the different organs in the human body.

Remind students that the system they are

going to learn about today is the system that

controls all the other body systems.


Ask students to look at Ricardo’s T-shirt again,

and then have a few volunteers share their

predictions.


- After students have shared, be sure to point out that it is indeed a brain on

Ricardo’s T-shirt if this observation has not been made.


- Tell students that they will be learning about the nervous system in the next

two Read-Alouds, and they will hear about how the nervous system is closely

interconnected with the other systems in the human body.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


 - Tell students that the word _nervous_ in this context has nothing to do with

feeling anxious, worried, or scared about something.


What does the nervous system control?


» The brain and the spinal cord control all of the other systems in the body.


 - Revisit the ‘K’ and ‘W’ sections of the KWL chart and add what students

know about the nervous system. Write any questions students have about

their nervous system in the ‘W’ section of the chart. Encourage students

to listen carefully to the information in the Read-Aloud to correct any

misunderstandings and/or to add more information to the KWL chart.


 - Tell students to listen carefully to learn about the nervous system and how it

commands the interconnected human body systems.

Ricardo


Stand up and stretch with me a

moment before we begin. Put your

hands on your hip bones and bend

forward as far as you can. Now,

straighten back up slowly, one

vertebra at a time. Ah, that’s better. Now, I’m ready to get started.

Are you? As you sit back down again, think about the body systems

you used to move just now.


Did you use your skeletal system? You bet! How about your

muscular system? Absolutely! Your muscles helped move your

bones when you stood up and bent down. But, how did your

muscles move? What told them what to do? Your brain! And your

brain is part of a very important system. Does anyone know what

that system is called? Yes—the nervous system!


Lesson 7 The Nervous System

Support


Point to the brain and the
spinal cord in the image
as you read the following
sentences. So the skeletal
and nervous systems are
closely interconnected.


**144**



Check for Understanding


How do your muscles and bones work together?


» Your muscles helped move your bones, like when you stood up and

sat down.


**Show Image U3.L7.2**
Nervous system


The nervous system is your body’s

**command** system, the one that sends

orders to all parts of your body. It is

your communication system, carrying

messages that control all other

systems. The central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal

cord. Without these central controllers, none of your body’s other

functions would happen.


Your brain is a soft mass of tissues protected by your skull, a rigid

helmetlike structure of bones encasing the brain. The spinal cord, the

main nerve pathway between your brain and the rest of your body,

looks like a long, thick rope. It extends from the base of your skull, or

brain stem, to your tailbone. Stretching down the back, this ropelike

cord sits inside of the openings in your back’s bony vertebrae. Your

spinal cord is protected by your spinal column, this flexible column of

vertebrae.


Check for Understanding


Why do you think it’s important that the vertebrae of the backbone
protect the spinal cord?


» Answers may vary but may include that the spinal cord should be

protected because it sends messages from the brain to the rest

of the body.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


**Show Image U3.L7.3**
Nerve network


A network of nerves links your brain

and spinal cord to muscles and sense

organs all over your body. Each nerve

is a bundle of fibers, tiny threadlike

cells encased in thin, fatty tissue.

These bundles of specialized cells carry messages to and from the

brain. These messages travel faster than the blink of an eye!


Some nerve cells collect messages from your brain and carry them to

your muscles. This is what happened when you stood and bent over

a few minutes ago. You **consciously** controlled your own actions with

your brain. First, you made the conscious decision to stand, and your

brain received that decision. Then, electrical signals were sent out

from your brain, along nerve fibers, to your muscles, telling them to

tighten or contract. For every movement that you make, your brain

**coordinates** the timing of muscle contractions, telling your muscles

when to tighten, how much to tighten, and for how long. Your nervous

system works with your muscles to move your bones in the way that the

brain commands.


Check for Understanding


How is bending over a conscious action?


» Answers will vary. Bending over requires a series of decisions that

you make, starting with the decision to stand.


How does the nervous system work with the skeletal and muscular
systems?


» Answers will vary. Your nervous system interacts with bones and

muscles to follow commands that the brain gives out.

» Digestion, heart rate, and
sleep patterns are all
automatically controlled
by the brain and spinal
cord. Your emotions,
moods, and memories are
controlled and managed
by the nervous system,
too. The body’s command
center, with its network of
nerves, is always working,
even while you sleep.

**146**



**Show Image U3.L7.4**
Five senses


Some nerve cells collect messages

from parts of your body and from your

environment and the world around

you. These nerve cells are called

**receptors.** Receptors collect messages through your eyes, ears,

nose, tongue, and skin. Each of your five senses works with your brain

to help you understand the world around you. Eyes pick up light and

color and send pictures to the brain to help you see. Ears pick up

vibrations from sound waves, carrying them to the brain to help you

hear. Sensory cells in the nose react to chemicals in the air, sending

messages to the brain to help you smell. Cells on the tongue react

to chemicals in food, sending signals to the brain to help you taste.

Receptors in your skin detect many different sensations, alerting

your brain and spinal cord to feelings of pain, heat, cold, pressure,

and touch.


Many times, nerve signals pass through both your brain and spinal

cord, but not always. Have you ever touched a hot iron or a hot pot

on the stove? What happened? Most likely, you jerked your hand

away from the heat very quickly, almost **unconsciously.** The nerves

in your fingers sent signals to your spinal cord, but this time you did

not need your brain at all. Your spinal cord sent a message to your

arm muscles, telling them to contract and pull back. This super quick

reaction to an emergency situation is called a **reflex** action because

the body acts automatically, without thinking. Some of you may

remember being at the doctor’s office for a checkup when the doctor

or nurse tapped your knee gently with a hard rubber tool called a

plexor. Other common reflex actions are flinching and sneezing.


Check for Understanding


Who can tell me what your leg does when the rubber taps it?


» It jerks upward.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


Because a nerve is made up of many cells, nerves can send many

messages at once. Each nerve cell sends its own message through the

nerve. You’ve learned that some nerve cells collect messages from

the brain, whereas others collect messages from the environment.

Still other nerve cells collect messages from inside your body.


Inside the human body, the brain and spinal cord work together day

and night, coordinating many activities that we don’t really think

about too often. For example, your breathing is controlled by the

central nervous system.


**Show Image U3.L7.5**
What the cerebellum does


Hundreds of billions of microscopic

cells are sending messages that go

dashing about your body at amazing

speeds every second. Many of these

cells are bundled up inside nerves, the body’s wiring. These nerves

branch out in all directions, carrying tiny electrical-chemical signals

from your brain and spinal cord to the tips of your fingers and toes, to

the inside of your eyes and ears, and to every other part of your body.

Some nerves are much thinner than a strand of hair. Others are as thick

as a bungee cord. All have an important part to play in the nervous

system’s nonstop communication process.


The nervous system processes almost everything you do. It helps you

laugh and scratch your chin. It helps you run and walk and swim. It

lets you scream with anger and shout for joy. It lets you smell tomato

soup simmering on the stove, hear squirrels rustling in the leaves,

and see a brilliant sunrise peeping over the hill. Thank your nervous

system for that tingling feeling that you get when you jump into a

cold stream, or the instant pain you feel when you prick your finger

on a rose’s thorn. Whether you are two or ninety-two, your nerves are

a central part of everything you do.


Next time, we’ll look more closely at your body’s main control center,

the brain. Let’s pause for a riddle before I go:


Lesson 7 The Nervous System

**148**



_I am called a bone, but I am really a nerve. My name suggests that I_

_have a sense of humor. What am I?_


**Show Image U3.L7.6**
Ricardo bumping his funny bone


Give up? I’m the “funny bone”! Does

anyone know where the funny bone is

located? It is a vulnerable nerve at the

end of the elbow bone. If you hit that

nerve at the end of your elbow, the nerve sends a tingly feeling up the rest

of your arm. If you injure your funny bone, the result is anything but funny.

It can be very painful, causing numbness in your forearm and hand. So, as

it turns out, the funny bone is not only not funny, but it’s not a bone at all!

Be careful the next time you’re wrestling with your friends. You won’t be

laughing if you hit your funny bone! ~~Have students locate their funny bone.~~


**Show Image U3.L7.7**
Ricardo


Well, I’ll be back next time to tell you

more about your body’s command

center. Can you guess what I mean when

I say command center? See you later!

~~Point to the hint on Ricardo’s T-shirt.~~


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** What is the part of the axial skeleton that encases the brain?

Why is it important for the brain to be protected by these bones?


» The skull protects the brain. The brain is vulnerable. Damage to the brain is very

serious and can affect the functions of all of the systems of the human body.


2. **Inferential.** What is the purpose of the network of nerves in the nervous system?


» The nerves link the brain and the spinal cord to muscles and other organs all over

the body, sending signals throughout the body.


3. **Evaluative.** At the beginning of the Read-Aloud, you stood up and stretched.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


Describe what happened between your brain, your muscles, and your bones.


» Once the conscious, voluntary decision to stand up was made, electrical signals

were sent from the brain down the spinal cord, along the nerves, to the muscles

involved in standing. These signals coordinated the timing of the muscles to

contract and told them how long to contract, helping the bones to move.


4. **Evaluative.** Could your brain be the command center of your body if you had

no receptors? Explain why or why not.


» No. Receptors are nerve cells that collect messages from inside the body and

through the five senses, and send these messages to the brain. The brain is then

able to help the body process how to react and understand the world around you.


**Think-Pair-Share** ~~**TEKS 3.6.B**~~


Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is one way to see how much everyone has

learned. Think of a question you can ask your neighbor about the Read-Aloud

that starts with the word _what_ . For example, you could ask, “What do nerves do in

the nervous system?” Turn to your neighbor and ask your “what” question. Your

neighbor will write your question on an index card and then read it back to you. Be

sure to suggest corrections to clarify your meaning if your question doesn’t sound

the way you intended. Next, your neighbor will respond to your question. Listen to

your neighbor’s response. Now switch places and have your neighbor ask a new

“what” question, which you will write down, read back, and respond to. I will call on

several of you to share your questions and answers with the class.


» Answers may vary.


~~**WORD WORK: CONSCIOUSLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the words _consciously_ and _unconsciously_ on the board in cursive and

provide an opportunity for students to apply decoding skills prior to the

words being discussed. Review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard, “You made voluntary decisions, consciously

controlling your own actions with your brain.” You also heard, “Most

likely, you jerked your hand away from the heat very quickly, almost

unconsciously.”


3. Say the words _consciously_ and _unconsciously_ with me.


4. _Consciously_, similar to _voluntarily_, means done on purpose or deliberately;

_unconsciously_, similar to _involuntarily_, means done without awareness or control.


5. I was so consciously focused on listening carefully to the teacher that I

unconsciously dropped my pencil.

“How does adding the prefix _un_  - to _consciously_ change that word?” (It makes it

mean the opposite of _consciously_ .) Directions: I am going to say a word and ask

you to tell me what that word means. If you do not know, I will help you. Then I

would like you to add the prefix _un_  - to the word and tell me what that new word

means.

 - Ask students to look at the image and read the caption on page 35, noting the

path messages take to get to the brain.


Lesson 7 The Nervous System
**153**


The nerves in your body are made up of nerve cells.
A single nerve contains many nerve cells.


Here is an illustration of nerve cells. You can see that
nerve cells have long stringy parts that lead away from
the center. The center of the cell is called the **cell body** .
The branches of the nerve cell that receive information
from other nerve cells are called **dendrites** .


Imagine that you want to send a letter to your aunt
who lives in another town. Someone will have to put the
letter in a car or truck and drive it to your aunt’s house.
You might do this yourself. You might pay the post office
to do it. When one of the nerves in your body wants to
send a message to your brain, it sends the message out
along the axons. An axon is a long cable that winds away
from from the cell body. The message travels along the
axons, much as a car or truck travels along a road. The
axons transmit the message and the **dendrites** receive it.

~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Human Body System Review**


**Materials:** Image U3.PP1.1


 - Project Image U3.PP1.1 (Human Body Systems) to review the seven body

systems that are reviewed in the first Read-Aloud. Ask students to identify

each system and discuss its purpose. Encourage students to use unit
related vocabulary.


**KWL Chart**


**Materials:** Activity Page PP.1; locally approved sources


 - Review with students the KWL chart you have filled out thus far, encouraging

students to use unit-related vocabulary. For the ‘W’ section, you may choose to

allow students to conduct research to answer some of the questions they have

about the human body that have not been answered.


**Letters to Dr. Welbody and Ricardo**


 - Tell students to look at the ‘W’ section and pick out one or two items they find

the most interesting. Then have students write letters to Dr. Welbody and/or

Ricardo, asking her/him for information or advice on their chosen items from

the ‘W’ section. Students may also share with Dr. Welbody or Ricardo a fact or


Pausing Point 1

**162**



two they think is interesting about the human body.


**Note:** You may wish to review with students the parts of a letter before they

begin to write to Dr. Welbody. You may also choose to act as Dr. Welbody

and/or Ricardo and answer students’ letters.


**Digital Projection Review**


 - Project images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students retell the Read
Aloud using the images.


**Image Review**


**Materials:** Choose any image from the lessons thus far


 - Project an image from any lesson presented thus far. Ask students if they

can remember the image and summary of the key content from the lesson.

For example, project Image U3.L1.3: The Skeletal System. Ask students what

they remember about this image. Students may say that the skeletal system

protects important organs.


 - Proceed to another image when the correct answer has been given.


**Note:** You may wish to put students in small groups so students can discuss

the image and their responses.


**Summarizing the Key Idea**


**Materials:** Reader; chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


 - Have students choose a Read-Aloud that they want to read again.


 - Ask students why they selected the specific Read Aloud. Explain that the

answers to these questions have to do with setting a purpose, or a reason,

for reading. Setting a purpose can help readers answer questions and find

information. It can also help readers know when they are not finding what they

need and might need to read further. ~~**[ TEKS 3.5; TEKS 3.6.A ]**~~


 - You may wish to have students take notes and create an outline to summarize

the key idea of a particular topic in the Read-Aloud. Be sure to guide students

in this important method of gathering information.


 - You may wish to model how to actively listen and take notes by doing the


**TEKS 3.5** Self-select text and read independently for a sustained period of time; **TEKS 3.6.A** Establish purpose for reading
assigned and self-selected texts.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


following activity with students:


    - In preparation for this activity, pick out two or three core vocabulary words

from the Read-Aloud you plan to reread, and write them on chart paper, a

chalkboard, or a whiteboard.


    - Begin by asking a few volunteers to share what they would say the key

idea is regarding the Read-Aloud you are about to reread. This discussion

is meant as a review and warm-up for active listening. Point out the core

vocabulary words you have chosen and have students read them together

chorally. Tell students that as you are rereading, they should be carefully

listening, especially when you get to one of the words on the board.


    - Tell students that as you read, they will be jotting down notes—words or

short phrases that best express the key idea. Be sure to tell them that

they should not be writing in complete sentences. You may wish to model

and have students follow an outline style. As you read, you may want to

slow down or even pause after reading the Guided Listening Supports that

follow the core vocabulary words you have chosen.


    - When you are finished rereading the Read-Aloud, have a few volunteers

share one or two notes they have taken. Be sure to give feedback to help

shape effective notes, and allow students to record any modifications you

guide them through.


    - Now have students summarize in two or three sentences the key idea for

this Read-Aloud using the three core vocabulary words in their sentences.


**Simon Says**


 - As a class, play Simon Says to reinforce vocabulary learned thus far for the

different parts of the skeletal and muscular systems. You may wish to conduct

a review prior to playing the game to refresh students’ memories and to

enhance participation.


**Song: “Dry Bones”**


 - Find a recording of the song “Dry Bones.” Have students listen to the song

once or twice, and encourage them to point to the various body parts

mentioned in the song. After listening to the song, have students discuss the

more technical names for the bones they learned about in the Read-Alouds;

e.g., the “head bone” as the skull or cranium; the “back bone” and “neck bone”

as the spine or spinal column; the “thigh bone” as the femur; the “knee bone”

as a hinge joint.


 - Ask students, “The skull and spine are both called what types of bones?”


Pausing Point 1
**163**


**164**



(axial bones) Ask, “What is another name for the bones in the legs and arms

that “hang onto” the axial skeleton?” (appendicular bones) Reinforce how

the different body parts mentioned in the song are interconnected. Explain

that the bones inside our bodies are not actually dry. Ask students why they

think that is.


**Note:** If your school has a music teacher, you may want to collaborate with

the teacher to teach this song to your students.


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


**Materials:** Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


 - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _cells_ . Have

them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word,

such as “building blocks for living things, microscopic, billions,” etc. Record

their responses on a piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard

for reference.


**Multiple-Meaning Word Activity: Organ**


**Show Image U3.L1.7: The excretory system**


 - Complete a Sentence in Context activity with the word _organ_ .


1. In Lesson 1, you heard, “Your skin, the largest organ of the body, excretes

sweat through its many pores.” This organ is a part of the body that performs a

specific function.


2. Even though skin has a specific function just as each of the other organs in

your body do, who can tell me what the main difference is? (Most of your

organs are on the inside of your body, but skin is on the outside.) [Have a

student point to the organs in the image—the skin, kidneys, and bladder.]


3. The word _organ_ can have another meaning. An organ is also a keyboard

instrument with many pipes; it makes music when someone plays the

keyboard and uses foot pedals to pump air through the pipes. An organist is

a person who plays the organ. An organ is played in very much the same way

that a piano is played. The organist presses the keys on the keyboard with his

or her fingers, while at the same time pressing the pedals with his or her feet.


4. Organs in your body and organs that play music are both nouns, because they

are things. Which is living, and which is nonliving?


5. With your neighbor, make a sentence for one of the meanings of _organ_ and

another sentence using the word _organist_ . Remember to be as descriptive as


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


possible and use complete sentences. I will call on some of you to share your

sentences. [Call on a few student pairs to share one or all of their sentences.

Have them point to the image if their sentence is about organs in the body.

You may also choose to have students draw an illustration to depict the

word _organ_ .]


**Riddles for Core Content**


 - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


    - I am the building block for all living things, and there are over 200 types of

me in the human body. What am I? (a cell)


    - I am a part of the body’s systems and have clearly defined functions.

Examples of me include the stomach, the liver, and the intestines.

What am I? (an organ)


    - I am a strong, elastic tissue. I can be found in places like the tip of your

nose and the top of your ear. What am I? (cartilage)


    - I am the system that helps to give your body structure, and I work to

protect your organs. What am I? (the skeletal system)


    - I am the area where two bones come together. What am I? (a joint)


    - I am a very strong muscle. I contract rhythmically without you having to

control the speed of the beat. What am I? (the heart)


    - I am the system that includes nerves, the brain, and the spinal cord.

What am I? (the nervous system)


**Class Book: The Human Body: Systems and Senses**


**Materials:** Drawing paper, drawing tools


 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book

to help them remember what they have learned thus far in this unit. Have

students brainstorm important information about the muscular, skeletal, and

nervous systems. Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture of, and

ask them to write a caption for the picture. Bind the pages to make a book to

put in the class library for students to read again and again. You may choose

to add more pages upon completion of the entire unit before binding

the book.


**Writing Prompts**


Pausing Point 1
**165**


Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:









The most interesting thing I’ve learned thus far is because . . .


The nervous/muscular/skeletal system is important for survival because . . .



**166**




- I would like to learn more about because . . .


- I would compare and contrast the nervous, muscular, and skeletal systems by . . .


- Using as a model the myth and figurative expression you learned about

Achilles and the Achilles tendon, write a myth that explains the funny bone.


**Nerves at Work**


**Materials:** Rulers


- Tell students that nerves are crucial for speedy reaction time. Ask students,

“Can you think of situations where it is important to have a quick reaction?”

Review with students that a reflex is involuntary and does not involve the

brain; today they will be testing their voluntary reactions.


- One student will hold the ruler vertically at its uppermost end between their

thumb and index finger. The other student will put their thumb and index

finger spread about two inches apart at the lowest end of the ruler. Without

a signal, the student holding the ruler will let it go. The other student will try

to catch the ruler between their thumb and index finger. The speed of the

reaction can be relatively measured by looking at the number on the ruler

where the student’s thumb and index finger caught the falling ruler. If some

students have a difficult time catching the ruler, tell the person holding it to

give the other student a signal when the ruler will be dropped. Give students

several turns dropping and trying to catch the ruler.


**Guest Presenter**


- Invite the school nurse to come to the class and read a book or give a

presentation on a topic related to the first five Read-Alouds in this unit.

Parents or guardians who work in the health care profession (doctors, nurses,

nurses’ aides) would also be good sources.

Hi! I’ve got lots of fascinating facts to

share with you today, so I’m hoping

that my brain is in good working order.

There’s a lot to remember. Raise your

hand if you have a brain. Whew! I’m

glad all hands went up. Yes, of course you have a brain. All vertebrates

have brains. Who remembers what else all vertebrates have? Right! A

backbone! You know that you have a backbone; you’ve been testing

out those wonderfully flexible spines that support your bodies and

protect your spinal cords.


Check for Understanding


How would your life be different if you didn’t have a backbone?


» Answers will vary.

The human brain encased in the skull


~~Point to the brain stem, the cranium, and~~

~~the skull in the image as you read the~~

~~following sentences:~~

You’ve learned that your nervous

system is a complex network with two essential organs; your spinal

cord and your brain. Your spinal cord is connected to your brain by

the **brain stem**, the central trunk of the brain. Your brain itself is very

soft, but it is well protected by your cranium, or braincase. This strong

eggshell-shaped part of your skull is formed from eight interlocking

bones, wedged together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

the brain has grooves and folds, resembling a huge walnut. About the



size of a cantaloupe or a grapefruit, this jellylike, pinkish-gray blob



has blood vessels running all through its wrinkled mass. They carry



oxygen, water, and other important nutrients to the brain.



Support


Show a length of 3
inches with your thumb
and forefinger.



Why does our brain float in a clear liquid? What could happen to our brains
if that liquid wasn’t there?


» Answers may vary. The clear liquid protects our brain from hitting

our skull if we hit our head. If the liquid wasn’t there, we could have

a serious brain injury.


The brain, when fully grown, weighs about three pounds. That may

seem pretty small and light for such a big body, but humans have

larger brains than animals when compared with their body size. So,

even though the brains of elephants and whales are actually larger

than human brains, their brains are smaller than ours compared with

the enormous size of their bodies.

Cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla


~~Point to the cerebrum, cerebellum, and~~

~~medulla in the image as you read the~~

~~following sentences:~~ There are three

main sections of the brain. They are

the **brain stem**, the **cerebrum,** and the **cerebellum.** Each part of the

brain has an important function. Your **brain stem**, about as thick as your

thumb, is approximately three inches long. It helps to relay messages

between your brain and spinal cord. The bottom third of your **brain stem**,

the part that blends into the top of your spinal cord, is called the **medulla.**

The **medulla** is responsible for many of your body’s involuntary, or


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses



**174**


automatic functions. The **medulla** helps control your breathing and your

heart beating. It also helps your digestive system do its work, and you

don’t even need to think about it.


The **medulla** even helps you sense both your external and internal

environment so your body can make the best adjustments for safety

and health.


These are just a few ways your nervous system is interconnected with

other systems.


Check for Understanding


What would happen if you didn’t have a **medulla** ?


» Answers will vary. Instead of your body doing things automatically,

you would have to think about and get your body to perform

everything you want it to do.


The **cerebrum** is the largest part of your brain, filling the whole

upper part of your skull. Language, memory, thought, sensations,

and decision making are housed in your **cerebrum** . Your **cerebrum** is

“the thinking brain,” and the part of the **cerebrum** that does most of

the thinking is called the **cerebral cortex.** Your cortex is the deeply

wrinkled outer surface of the **cerebrum** . The more that it is used,

the thicker it becomes. In other words, people who use their brains

to think a lot develop thicker cortexes. Do you think your cortex is

getting any thicker? It is—you are learning a lot each day!

Lesson 8 The Nervous System and the Brain
**175**


**176**



The two **hemispheres** of the brain, the left **hemisphere** and the

right **hemisphere**, are linked to one another by thick nerve fibers.

Interestingly, each hemisphere has it’s own specialty for learning and

responsibility for muscle movement. Did you know that your right

hemisphere controls the muscles on the left side of your body?


Place your left hand on your head and wave your right arm. The left

side of your **cerebrum** controls muscles on the right side of your body.

Now, place your right hand on your head and wave your left arm. The

right side of your **cerebrum** controls muscles on the left side of your

body.


One **hemisphere** develops learning specialties that are different

than the other **hemisphere** . The left **hemisphere** is associated with

language, math and science, and reading. The right **hemisphere** is

mostly associated with imagination, music and art, and understanding

patterns. Together, the right and left **hemispheres** work together to

move your body and help you learn about living in your environment.


If, however, you use the left side of your body more—that is, you kick

with your left foot and you hold your pencil in your left hand—the

right **hemisphere** is dominant. The right **hemisphere** is mostly

associated with imagination, music, and shapes.

Which **hemisphere** of your brain is active when moving the left side of
your body?

What the cerebellum does


The third part of the brain, in addition

to the **brain stem** and the **cerebrum**,

is called the **cerebellum**, meaning

“little brain.”


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


Tucked under your **cerebrum** in the back of your brain, your **cerebellum**

resembles your **cerebrum** with two **hemispheres** of its own. Your

**cerebellum** is the control center for balance and coordination. It is

constantly adjusting the way your body moves. As you practice any physical

activity, such as dancing, your cerebellum receives messages about your

body’s actions and positions. It sends commands back to your muscles,

adjusting your movements. As your **cerebellum** gradually becomes more

**accurate** in its corrections, you begin to notice improvements in your

dancing, or whatever activity you are trying to perfect. For example, if you

have learned to ride a bike, chances are you didn’t master it all at once. It took

practice. Your **cerebellum** was in charge of your balance and coordination,

making small adjustments with each improvement until you could peddle

quickly and furiously on your own without even thinking about it.


Let’s try an experiment to demonstrate what the **cerebellum** does.

Close your eyes and reach your arms out to your sides so your body

makes the shape of a ‘T’. Slowly, bring your arms forward, touching

the fingertips together. You may open your eyes now. Was that easy

for you? Your **cerebellum** coordinated your movements for you. If you

damaged your **cerebellum**, you would not be able to do this simple

exercise. No matter how hard you tried, your hands would jerk around

without any control.


Check for Understanding


How would your life be different without a **cerebellum** ?


» Answers may vary. You would be unable to control your body.

Great job, everyone!


Your brain is not very big, and yet it is more powerful than the

strongest computer ever created. All other systems of the body are

**dependent** upon this complex three-pound organ that lives inside

your skull. Your brain is the center of your memory, thoughts, and

feelings. Your brain is in command of your whole body. When your

brain stops working, the rest of your body will stop working as well.

Lesson 8 The Nervous System and the Brain
**183**


I told you a little about the spinal cord earlier, when
we were looking at the skeletal system. I told you that
the bones that make up your spine—the vertebrae—
are there to protect your spinal cord. The vertebrae
are **hollow** and long strings of nerves run through the
**hollow** parts of the bones. The nerves that make up the
spinal cord run all the way up your back and neck. They
end up in the brain.


If I were to have a serious accident and damage
my spinal cord, I might end up **paralyzed** —unable
to move my legs and/or my arms. I might need to
use a wheelchair to get around, like the boy in this
photograph. Some diseases also affect the spinal cord
and can result in the use of a wheelchair or powerchair.
A powerchair is a wheelchair that is battery powered to
assist the person in moving their chair.


You see, the brain uses the spinal cord as a sort of
super-highway to send and receive messages to and
from the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is broken,
or damaged, the messages can’t get through to the arms
and legs.

 - Tell students that first, they will help you add information to the chart for

each system.


 - Point out the categories listed on the chart for each system of the body.

(Function, Features, Unique Facts, Example of How it Works)


 - Ask students to open their Readers to the table of contents, locate “The

Skeletal System,” and then turn to the first page of the chapter.


 - Have students read **page 4** to themselves to determine what the function of

the skeletal system is.


 - Students should answer “gives your body shape.” Add this to the appropriate

place on the chart.


 - Next, ask students, “How many bones are in your body?”


 - Students should answer “more than 200.” Add this to the appropriate place on

the chart.


 - Ask students to turn to **page 12**, which is the first page of “All About Bones.”


Lesson 9 The Nervous System and the Brain, Part 2
**203**


**204**




- Read **page 12** aloud to students and ask them to listen for a unique fact that

can be added to the chart.


» Bones are made of calcium.


- Read **page 14** aloud to students and ask them to listen for another unique fact

that can be added to the chart.


» Marrow inside bones makes red blood cells.


- For the remaining unique fact, you will need to wait until you get to **page 24** of

“Joints and Muscles” to add it to the chart.


» Bones meet at a joint.


- Ask students for an example of how the skeletal system works, and add it and

others, as needed, to the chart. If students are not able to provide an example,

share the one listed in the chart at the end of this lesson.


- Follow the same procedures to fill in information about the muscular system

using details from **pages 21–23** . Use information found on **page 28** to add

one more unique feature to the skeletal system column. Use information found

on **pages 36, 38 and 42** to fill in information about the nervous system.


- Tell students you want to compare and contrast the systems of the body using

the information you added to the chart and their background knowledge about

body systems.


- You may wish to use the following questions to guide the discussion:


   - How are the systems alike?


» Answers may vary, but could include that they each help the body in a

particular way.


   - Which body system has the most “pieces,” or features? Which has the least?


» The muscular system has the most, with more than 650 muscles. The nervous

system has the least with 100-200 nerves.


   - How do the skeletal system and muscular system work together?


» Answers may vary but could include that muscles are connected to bones by

tendons and are the only way bones can move.


   - How do the skeletal system and the nervous system work together?


» Answers may vary but could include that the nervous system uses muscles to

move bones so we can walk, sit, run, exercise, and lie down to rest.


   - How do the muscular system and nervous system work together?


» Answers may vary but could include that the nervous system allows muscles

to sense what is going on around them and tells them when to move, both

voluntarily and involuntarily.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


   - Compare and contrast voluntary muscles, involuntary muscles, and reflexes.


» Voluntary muscles move when you make them move, while involuntary

muscles move automatically without any direction from you. Reflexes are like

involuntary muscles in that they happen automatically as a way that your

body protects itself.


   - Which system is most important to your body? Why?


» Answers may vary.

a clue as to what the paragraph will be about. A concluding sentence wraps up

the paragraph and often restates the topic sentence.


- Tell students that just as Mr. Mowse was confused about ordering sentences,

sometimes paragraphs will have sentences that do not belong in the

paragraph because they do not relate to the topic sentence.


- Ask students to turn to Activity Page 9.2 and explain that the page includes

several paragraphs. Each paragraph has a topic sentence, followed by

additional sentences. Explain, however, that in each paragraph, there is a

sentence that does not relate to the topic sentence. Explain that students are

~~**“VISION: PARTS OF THE EYE” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U3.L10.1**
Ricardo


Imagine a typical day. You are always

looking around at people and books

and screens, at animals and cars and

trees. Before crossing a street, you

look both ways for traffic. What part of your body do you use to look

at all these things? Your eyes, of course! And which body organ do

you think helps your eyes to see? Yes—the **wondrous** brain. Human

eyes work together with the brain in order to see.


Of all your senses, your sense of sight is the one you use the most.

More than half of all the information you collect from your environment

is received through your eyes. Then, the information is sent to the back

of your brain, sometimes called the “mind’s eye,” where your brain

interprets what your eyes see and creates a picture for you.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


Check for Understanding


What body organ do your eyes work with in order to see?

» brain


**Show Image U3.L10.2**
Eye composite


Remember when we looked at the

different parts of the skull?


- Point to your skull. Point out the different bones discussed in the

following passage.


The cranium, which houses your brain, is only one part of your skull.

Besides the eight flat cranial bones, there are 20 additional skull

bones. Some of these bones form the eye sockets, two holes that are

the perfect size for housing and protecting your eyeballs.


- (Demonstrate for students where their eye sockets are located.) You can

feel your eye sockets by gently touching the area around your eyeball. (Invite

students to gently feel their eye sockets.)


Before we take a look at an eyeball, let’s look at what surrounds

your eyes. There are other things that also play an important part

in helping you to see. Turn and look at your neighbor. See the hairs

above the eyes? What are they called? Right—the eyebrows. They’re

not just there to look pretty. They have a purpose.


Now, close your eyes. What is the skin called that covers your eyes?

Yes—eyelids. Your eyelids protect your eyes, too, keeping them moist

by spreading tears over them. Tears are produced by tear glands,



Challenge


Does anyone know what
your eyebrows do?


» Your eyebrows help keep
dust and sweat out of
your eyes.



Lesson 10 Vision: The Parts of the Eye

Invite students to identify
the eyebrows, eyelids,
and tear ducts of their
neighbors’ eyes, and share
their function.

located above each eyeball on the underside of the eyelid. These

salty water droplets keep your eyes wet and help fight germs. Tear

ducts are tiny raised bumps located in the inner corner of your eyes,

containing openings no larger than a pinhole. These tiny openings are

the drains for your tears!


Check for Understanding


What do you think you would be doing when your tear ducts drain a lot of
tears quickly?

» crying


Your eyelashes, the short curved hairs growing on the edges of your

eyelids, keep dust particles out as well. There are muscles all around

each eye—six in all. They control your eyes’ movements, allowing

them to swivel in their sockets, looking up and down and side to side.


Now we’re ready to take a peek at the parts of your eyeball itself.

Look at your neighbor again. What shape is his or her eyeball? It may

appear oval to you, but the eyeball is actually well named because it

is round, just like a basketball. It looks oval because some parts are

hidden behind the eyelids.


What color were your neighbor’s eyes? Did you notice? Look again.


**Show Image U3.L10.3**
Close-up of eye (sclera, cornea, iris, pupil)


Let’s look at this picture together. The

outer visible part of the eye includes

the sclera, **cornea**, **iris**, and **pupil** .

The white outer layer of the eye is

called the sclera. The thin, tough,

transparent tissue that covers the colored part of the eye is called

the **cornea**, and it allows light to pass through. Together, the sclera

and the **cornea** protect the eye from germs, dangerous particles, and


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


damaging light rays. The colored part of the eye, the disc located just

behind the transparent **cornea**, is called the **iris** . At the center of the

**iris** is a black circle. Do you see it? This dark circular hole, called the

**pupil**, varies in size as it regulates the amount of light entering the

eye. The muscles of the **iris** control the size of the **pupil**, tightening to

make the **pupil** smaller in bright light, and relaxing to make the **pupil**

larger in dim light.


Check for Understanding


Which two parts of the eye help protect it from germs, dangerous
particles, and damaging light rays?

» sclera and cornea


**Show Image U3.L10.4**
Inside the human eye


 - As you read the following sentences, point to the diagram.


You can see clearly only if the right amount of light enters your eyes.

Eyes are designed to focus light. Every part of the eye has a role

to play, including those parts that lie inside the eyeball. So, what

_is_ inside the eyes? Liquid and jelly! That’s right—eyes are soft and

hollow; the clear fluid and jelly inside them give them their round

shape. There are three important parts _inside_ the eyeballs that help

you see: the **lens**, the **retina**, and the **optic nerve** .


Lesson 10 Vision: The Parts of the Eye
**217**


Support


Invite students to reteach
the path light takes when
entering your eye, with the
projected diagram.


**218**



**Show Image U3.L10.5**
Sight diagram


In order to see, you need light. It can be

natural light from the sun or electrical

light from a bulb, but all seeing begins

with light. The eye sees objects by

seeing the light that reflects, or bounces off, objects. Imagine that you

are looking at a house. The sun shines down on the house. Light from

the sun bounces off the house and travels to your eyes.


Light rays bend toward each other as they pass through the **cornea**,

the transparent tissue that covers the **iris** . This bending is the first

step in focusing the light. The bent light rays then pass through the

**pupil** to a clear disc called the **lens** . The rubbery, flexible **lens** adjusts

its shape in order to focus on near or distant objects, creating crisp

images. As the light rays pass through the **lens**, they bend even

closer, cross one another, and land on the cup-shaped **retina** at the

back of the eye. An image of the house is formed on the **retina**, but

because light rays are bent, the image appears upside down on the

retina. The light-receiving cells of the retina transfer light rays into

electrical energy so that the nervous system can send information

to your brain via the **optic nerve** . The short, thick **optic nerve** is

fixed to the back of the eyeball, just behind the **retina** . Acting like

a cable, it passes through a tunnel in the skull and connects the

eyeball to the brain. The **optic nerve** carries messages to the brain

to be processed. The brain recreates the image so that the house is

now seen right side up! As the eyes work together with the nervous

system, this whole process takes less than one second to complete.

When you think of the factors and parts of the eye that are involved

in allowing us to see, it is indeed **wondrous** to think that it takes less

than one second to see!


Eyes are so important to us that it is troubling when things go wrong

with them, preventing us from seeing as well as we would like.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


Two of the most common eye problems are **nearsightedness** and

**farsightedness** . Have you heard those terms before? Let’s find out

what they mean.


**Show Image U3.L10.6**
Diagram of nearsightedness and
farsightedness


We know that people come in all

shapes and sizes. Look around you.

Legs and arms and faces and heads

are all different shapes and sizes. So, it

makes sense that eyes vary in shape and size from person to person,

too. The size and shape of the eye affects its ability to focus light and

work well. In perfect vision, as light rays pass through the **lens** of the

eye, they meet in just the right place to project a clear image on the

**retina** . But sometimes the **cornea** or the **lens** is not quite the right

shape to bend the light in the most effective way. Sometimes the

shape of the eyeball affects how clearly images are projected on the

**retina** . When these things occur, vision may become blurry.


**Show Image U3.L10.7**
Light entering the eye


In **nearsightedness**, the eyeball’s

size in relation to the **cornea** affects

its focusing power, so images are

projected, or focused, in front of

the **retina** . Nearby objects are seen

clearly, but distant objects are out of focus. In **farsightedness**, the

eyeball’s size affects the focusing power of the lens, so images are

projected, or focused, behind the **retina** . Distant objects are seen

clearly, but nearby objects are out of focus.



Challenge


Encourage students
to brainstorm what
nearsightedness and
farsightedness mean.


Challenge


Who can tell us what
contact lenses are?



Lesson 10 Vision: The Parts of the Eye
**219**


**220**



Check for Understanding


Who is farsighted or nearsighted? What does it mean for you?

» Farsighted means you can see things that are faraway, but not up

close. Nearsighted means you can see things up close, but faraway

things are hard to see.


Luckily, these problems can both be corrected with glasses or

contact lenses.

Before I go, let’s try a riddle or two:


I reflect off objects and enter your

eyes. I bend to help you see. Your sight

depends on me. What am I?


» light


Objects appear upside down on me. I live at the back of your eyeball.

What am I?


» retina


I am the part of your eye that is colored. Sometimes I’m green, but I

could be brown, gray, blue. What am I?


» iris


OK, it’s time for me to go! Next time we’ll look at the smallest bone in

your body. Can anyone predict where it is? Hint: It’s part of another

sensory organ.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What are your five senses?


» sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


2. **Literal.** How do these senses work with the brain to process information

about our surroundings?


» Information about the environment is collected through the senses and is sent

back to the brain for interpretation.


**Show Image U3.L10.3**
Close-up of eye
(sclera, cornea, iris, pupil)


3. **Inferential.** What are the visible, or external, parts of the eye?


» eye sockets, eyebrows, eyelids, eyelashes, sclera, cornea, iris, and pupil


4. **Inferential.** What is the purpose of these visible parts?


» Eyebrows and eyelashes keep away dust, sweat, and other particles; eyelids and

tear ducts keep the eyeball moist; the pupil controls how much light enters the

eyeball; the sclera and cornea protect from germs, particles, and light rays; eye

sockets are the “house” that protect the eyeball.


**Show Image U3.L10.4**
Inside the human eye


5. **Literal.** What are the inner, or internal, parts of the eye?


» lens, retina, and optic nerve


6. **Evaluative.** Describe how the parts of the eye work together with the

nervous system to allow a person to see.


» Light travels through the cornea, and as it passes through, the light bends.

The bent light passes through the pupil to the lens. The lens bends the light

again to finish focusing the image. This light lands on the retina, where the light

is transferred to electrical energy so the optic nerve can send information to

the brain.

**Primary Focus:** Students will identify and use parts of a paragraph, including a

topic sentence, supporting details, and a concluding statement, in a written

piece. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.12.B**~~


~~**WRITING TITLES FOR PARAGRAPHS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that today, they are going to practice writing titles for paragraphs.


 - Remind students that a paragraph is a collection of sentences on one topic. A

paragraph has a topic sentence that tells the key idea, or what the paragraph

is mostly about. A paragraph also has a concluding sentence that wraps up the

paragraph and often restates the topic sentence.


 - Write the following sentence on the board: _How Does Your Body Work?_ teaches

readers about three of the systems that make up your body. (Make sure that

you indent this sentence when you write.)


 - Tell students that this sentence will be the topic sentence of a paragraph you

will write together as a class. As the topic sentence, it tells what the rest of the

paragraph will be about, so all of the other sentences in the paragraph will be

about the three systems described in _How Does Your Body Work?_


 - Ask students to brainstorm facts learned from the first chapters of the Reader.

(Some ideas might include: skeletal system is made up of bones filled with

marrow cells; muscular system allows bones to move; muscles are either

voluntary or involuntary; nervous system sends messages to and from the

body, etc.). Stop after you have three or four ideas.


 - Have students put their ideas into sentences.


 - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all

assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


 - Review these ideas with students, ensuring that their examples relate to the

topic sentence. Omit any that do not relate. Write these sentences on the

board, following the topic sentence, in paragraph form.

 - Also, check that the last sentence serves as a good concluding sentence.


 - Remind students that a title tells what the paragraph is about but is not

written in sentence form. Titles for paragraphs are often phrases made from

the key words in the topic sentence.


 - Ask students to suggest possible titles for the paragraph that you have just

written as a class. Choose one and write it on the board above the sentence.

Point out that the important words of the title are capitalized. Since titles

aren’t sentences, there is no ending punctuation.


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 10.3.


 - Read the first paragraph to students, noting that all of the sentences are about

summer and why it is the best season, and that the first sentence is the topic

sentence. Point out that the last sentence is a concluding sentence that wraps

up the paragraph by restating the topic sentence.


 - Ask students to use the words in the topic sentence to create a title. Write

their suggested titles on the board.


 - Remind students to capitalize the first and last word of the title and

any other important word(s). Since titles aren’t sentences, there is no

ending punctuation.

**Spelling Analysis Directions**


- Students are likely to make the following errors:


   - Not changing the ‘ _f_ ’ to ‘ _v_ ’ before adding _–es_


   - Adding _–es_ to the words that end with ‘ _fe_ ’


- While either of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still

be aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find

it helpful to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the

analysis chart. For example:


   - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


   - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


   - Is the student consistently making errors on particular

beginning consonants?


- Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


- Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization

and punctuation.


- Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

**Lesson 11: Hearing: The Parts of the Ear**

Speaking and Listening [45][M]


**Primary Focus:** Students will describe the relationships between the parts of the

ear in “Hearing: The Parts of the Ear” using language that pertains to sequence and

cause/effect. ~~**TEKS 3.1.A; TEKS 3.6.B; TEKS 3.7.C; TEKS 3.7.D**~~


~~**PREVIEWING VOCABULARY (5 MIN.)**~~


The following are core vocabulary words used in this lesson. Preview the words

with the students before the lesson. Students are not expected to be able to use

these words immediately, but with repeated exposure throughout the lessons,

they will acquire a good understanding of most of the words. You may wish

to display the vocabulary words in your classroom for students to reference.

Students may also keep a “unit dictionary” notebook along with definitions,

sentences, and/or other writing exercises using these vocabulary words.


 - Display the vocabulary words on the board.


 - Divide the words into syllables.


 - Cover one syllable at a time with your hand and segment the word.


 - Then, point to each syllable and ask the students to “read it fast” to signal

them to read through the word.


 - Explicitly point out any unusual or challenging letter-sound correspondences in

any syllable, as well as one or two other words with the same letter-sound spelling.


**cochlea,** the spiral-shaped organ filled with fluid and hair cells that allows a

person to hear


**eardrum,** the thin, stretched membrane across the ear canal that vibrates

when sound waves hit it


**inner ear,** the deep part of the ear that has semicircular canals and the

cochlea and that helps hearing and balance


**middle ear,** the main hollow space of the ear behind the eardrum and before

the inner ear


**outer ear,** the part of the ear that is visible on the side of the head; its job is to

catch sounds and funnel them into the middle ear


**TEKS 3.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments; **TEKS 3.6.B** Generate questions about text before, during, and after reading to deepen understanding and gain information; **TEKS 3.7.C** Use

Support


Remind students that when
eyes are seeing, there is a
sequence, or order, by which
each part of the eye receives
and processes the light that
is coming into the eye. Ask
for a volunteer to explain the
route the light takes. (First
light passes through the
cornea, then the pupil, then
the lens, and finally it lands
on the retina.)


Challenge


Ask students to brainstorm
ideas for how people who
are deaf can communicate
with others. (through sign
language, by reading lips,
and with computers)


**240**




- Remind students that the various human body systems are interconnected.


- Ask students, “What are the names of the systems you have learned about

so far?”


» skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems


- Ask students to share what they remember about the muscular and skeletal

systems, using the KWL chart for support as needed. Reread any riddles about

these two systems and have students provide the answers.


- Ask students, “What does the term _sensory organ_ mean?”


» an organ that allows you to use one of your five senses


- Review the parts of the eye, showing students images from the Read-Aloud

if needed.


- Add any new information about the nervous system to the KWL chart,

especially facts learned about the different parts of the eye, and how they

work together to allow us to see.


- Reread any riddles about the nervous system and have students provide

the answers.


- Tell students that today they will be learning about their ears and the different

parts that work together to allow them to hear.


- Ask students to make predictions about whether or not sound travels in a

sequence, or order, through the ear parts, similar to how light travels through

the eye. You may wish to record their responses on the KWL chart and address

the responses during the Discussing the Read-Aloud section.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


 - Revisit the ‘K’ and ‘W’ sections of the KWL chart and add what students know

about their ears. Write any questions students have about their ears in the ‘W’

section of the chart.


 - Encourage students to listen carefully to the information in the Read-Aloud to

correct any misunderstandings, and/or add more information to the KWL chart.


 - Remind students that observations are an important part of the learning

process for scientists. Then tell them that you would like them to closely look

at a partner’s ear.


 - Ask them to draw the different parts of the ear that they observe, and to label

the parts that they know.


 - Give students a few minutes to look at a partner’s ear and draw the various

parts. You may wish to also draw the parts of the ear on a piece of chart paper,

chalkboard, or whiteboard.


 - Review with students the parts that they may already know, such as the earlobe.


 - Remind students that when studying the human body’s systems and senses,

they will learn about both internal and external parts.


 - Tell students to listen carefully to find out details about how the ear works and

how hearing helps us understand the world around us.

Hear ye! Hear ye! Today we’re going to

poke around in your skull once more

to learn about another one of your

sensory organs. I’ll give you a hint with

another one of my special riddles:


We are located near your eyes. There are two of us. My twin hangs out

on the opposite side of your head. We both hate the sound of sirens.

What are we?


» ears


Lesson 11 Hearing: The Parts of the Ear
**241**


Challenge


Think about these two
words: _canal_ and _drum_ .
What hints do they give you
about how these ear parts
work and function?


» A canal is a pathway, and
a drum vibrates when hit,
producing sound.


Support


Invite students to identify
the outer parts of their ears
as you read through the
following information:


The bottom part of each
earflap, or pinna, is called
an earlobe.


Touch your earlobe, the
bottom part of your pinna.


It is much softer than
the top part because it
does not contain any
cartilage. Some earlobes
are attached to the side of
the head, whereas others
dangle loose. Do you know
which sort you have? Turn
to your neighbor and ask.


**242**



**Show Image U3.L11.2**
Ear up close


Yes—your ears! Your ears work together

with your brain to help you hear. Think

about all the different sounds you hear

throughout your day. You hear alarm

clocks, water running, doors opening,

horns honking, bells ringing, people talking, and so much more. Your ears are

very important in the classroom, where you need to listen in order to learn.

Your ears help you thicken your cerebral cortex! You are going to hear about

all the parts of the ear that work together as an interconnected system.


Your ear is divided into three sections: the **outer ear**, **middle ear**,

and **inner ear** . Just like your eyes, only part of your ears is visible.

The other parts are hidden inside the protective bones of your skull.


Mammals are the only animals with **outer ears** . The **outer ear**

consists of flaps on either side of your head, the **ear canal**, and the

**eardrum** . Your outer earflaps are called pinna [PIN-ah]. They are

made of skin and a tough elastic tissue called cartilage.


Check for Understanding


Who remembers which other parts of the body contain flexible cartilage?

» ears, nose, and ends of bones


The bottom of each earflap, or pinna, is called the earlobe. It is much softer

than the top part because it does not contain any cartilage. Some earlobes are

attached to the side of the head, whereas others dangle loose. Do you know

which sort you have? Turn to your neighbor to ask.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


**Show Image U3.L11.3**
Human ear (ear canal, eardrum, hammer,
anvil, stirrup cochlea, auditory nerve)


Shaped something like a cup, your

**outer ear** is a sound catcher. It collects

sound waves from the air around you

and funnels them through your ear canal to your **eardrum** . Your ear

canal is like a tunnel, about half as long as one of your pinky fingers.


The inside of the ear canal is lined with tiny hairs, and earwax is

constantly being produced by glands beneath the soft skin.


Check for Understanding


Can anyone guess what earwax does? I’ll give you a hint: earwax serves
a similar purpose to that of tears.

» An analogy could be “earwax is to ears as tears are to eyes.”


Earwax prevents infections by keeping dirt and other particles

from building up in the ear canal. At the end of the ear canal, sound

bounces off of a thin, flexible flap of skin that stretches across the

end of this tunnel. This **membrane**, or thin skin flap, is called an

**eardrum** because sound **vibrates** off it in the same way that sound

**vibrates** off the top of a drum when it is pounded with a drumstick.

Your **eardrum** separates your **outer ear** from your **middle ear** .


Your **middle ear** is a tiny, air-filled space just behind your **eardrum** .

As the **eardrum vibrates**, or shakes, three itty-bitty bones inside the

**middle ear** begin to move, too. These three bones are named for their

shapes: the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup. They are the smallest

bones in your body. The stirrup is the smallest of the three, no bigger

than a grain of rice. These three tiny bones form a chain, held in place

by muscles, that leads from the **middle ear** to the **inner ear** .


OK, it’s time for an experiment. Close your mouth and form a puddle of

spit inside your mouth. As you swallow your spit, listen closely. Did you

hear anything? You should hear a little click. The **middle ear** is linked


Lesson 11 Hearing: The Parts of the Ear

Ears also have to “pop”
when you go to deeper
places. People who scuba
dive and swim deep in
the ocean learn different
ways to help their middle
ears maintain the correct
amount of air pressure
while they’re underwater.


**244**



to the back of your throat by a narrow tube. Whenever you swallow,

chew, or yawn, the tube opens to let air travel in and out of your

**middle ear** . That keeps the air pressure constant on either side of your

**eardrum**, preventing it from bursting. Have your ears ever felt clogged

in an airplane or while riding in a car over a mountain? Suddenly, you

hear a loud pop and they are fine again. The tube connecting your

throat to your **middle ear** opened up. Thank goodness!


Your **inner ear** is located inside your skull. It is the most complicated

and delicate part of the ear, consisting of a maze of tubes inside a

liquid-filled, bony, hollow space. At the end of the maze is a snail
shaped, coiled, bony tube filled with fluid. This part of your ear, lined

with tiny hairs, plays a very important part in hearing. It is called the

**cochlea**, which means “snail” in Latin. Some people who cannot hear

get cochlear implants, invented devices that function just like the

**cochlea** functions. The second part of the inner ear is the **auditory**

**nerve**, which can be likened to the optic nerve of the eyeball.


Check for Understanding


Who can tell me what the function of the optic nerve is?

» connects the eyeball to the brain, relaying what is seen by the eyes

to the brain for processing


What do you think is the job of the auditory nerve?

» to send information that is heard to the brain for processing


**Show Image U3.L11.4**
How hearing works


So, just exactly how do ears work?

Your ears collect sound waves, or

vibrations. Sound waves are tiny, invisible

movements in the air. Sounds are heard

only when these waves bump against the

**outer ear** and get funneled into your ear canals. Different sounds have

different wave patterns. Loud sounds, such as the sound of a jackhammer,

have larger waves than softer sounds, such as the purring of a cat. The

louder the sound, the larger the vibration is inside your ear. For you to hear


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


sounds, vibrations must travel from your **outer ear**, through your **middle**

**ear**, to your **inner ear**, and on to your brain for processing. Let’s follow a

sound wave through an ear to see how it works.


First, the **outer ear**, or sound catcher, collects sound waves and channels

them into the ear canal. Once the sound waves are channeled into the ear,

they hit the **eardrum**, causing it to **vibrate** . As the **eardrum vibrates**, so

do the three bones in the middle ear. Next, hinged together by miniature

joints, the hammer hits the anvil, and the anvil hits the stirrup. All these

vibrations in the **middle ear** cause liquid in the inner ear to **vibrate** as well.


Check for Understanding


Let’s review these first few steps of hearing before we move on to the rest.


         - Encourage students to use sequencing words to retell the initial steps

of hearing. ~~**TEKS 3.7.D**~~


Wrapped inside the cochlea is a long, narrow ribbon with thousands

of hair cells, each loaded with tiny hairs. The vibrations in the **middle**

**ear** create waves in the fluid of the **inner ear** that cause the tiny

hairs of the **cochlea** to ripple as well. Next, the sensory hair cells

bend and stretch, producing nerve **impulses** . These signals are

carried on nerve fibers, or threads, along the **auditory nerve** to the

hearing center of the brain. The brain is able to recognize the nerve

impulses, or signals, as sound, even determining the direction from

which the sound comes. The brain receives lots of different vibrations

at the same time and is able to tell the signals apart, passing the

information along to you and allowing you to hear. These signals

hardly ever get mixed up in your amazing brain.


Just like the process of the eyeball working with light, the process of

hearing sounds is also quite wondrous!


For some people, hearing is difficult or even impossible when one or

more parts of this system are not working properly. When people are

not able to hear anything, or perhaps only a very few sounds, we say

they are deaf or hard of hearing.


**TEKS 3.7.D** Retell and paraphrase texts in ways that maintain meaning and logical order.


Lesson 11 Hearing: The Parts of the Ear

**Show Image U3.L11.5**
Inner ear detail


Your **inner ear** is the seat of your

hearing, but it has another important

job to perform as well. Your balance is

controlled by your **inner ear** . Nestled

beside your cochlea are three curved

tubes called the semicircular canals. These canals are filled with

fluid and lined with tiny hairs, just like the **cochlea** . Whenever you

move your head—turning around, lying down, or bending forward—

fluid inside the semicircular canals causes the hair to bend. The

bending of the canals’ tiny hairs sends nerve signals to your brain

to let it know where and how you are moving. Your brain then sends

messages to your muscles to keep you steady, maintaining your

balance. Have you ever whirled around so fast that you became dizzy

and lost your balance? That’s because the fluid in the canals kept

moving for a few seconds even after you stopped.

It’s almost time to stop for today, but

first close your eyes and fold your

hands in your lap. Let’s sit very quietly

and find out how many different sounds

we can hear in the room. (Allow for students to share what they hear.)

**Primary Focus:** Students will use spelling patterns and generalizations (e.g.,

ending rules) in writing words. ~~**TEKS 3.2.B.iv; TEKS 3.2.B.vii**~~


Students will decode multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.

~~**TEKS 3.2.A.i**~~


~~**REVIEW SPELLING AND IRREGULAR NOUNS (20 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** This week is a mixed review of spelling patterns. All of these patterns

and words should be familiar to students.


 - Tell students that the words for this week are all words they have learned and

practiced before.


**TEKS 3.2.B** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns; (vii) spelling words using knowledge of suffixes, including how they can change base words such as dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling final consonants; **TEKS 3.2.A.i** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic
words with multiple sound-spelling patterns such as eigh, ough, and en.

- Display the Verb Chart and Singular and Plural Noun Chart that you created

before the lesson.


- When introducing the words, use these procedures:


Step 1: Introducing the Verbs


- Tell students that this week, they will review spelling patterns they have

applied so far in Grade 3. On the assessment, they will be responsible for

determining the form of the verb or noun that fits in the oral sentence

provided. These are all words that students have spelled in Grade 3.


- Tell students they will review this week’s spelling words in sections, or chunks.

The first section will be verbs. Remind students that a verb describes an action.


- Have students work in cooperative groups to correctly spell words with _–ed,_

_–ing, –s,_ and _–es_ .


Step 2: Adding Suffixes


- Give students a list of verbs and provide each group with two suffixes to apply

the spelling rule.


- As students take turns spelling the words, have them use the word correctly in

a sentence.


- As students work, circulate and monitor student progress.


- Engage in a gallery walk to see if each group spelled the words correctly and

have students provide feedback to address misconceptions.


- When introducing the words, use these procedures:


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


Step 1: Introducing Singular Nouns


 - As you introduce each of the spelling words, write it in the table, pronouncing

each word as you write it.

|Singular Noun|Plural Noun|
|---|---|
|book||
|puppy||
|knife||
|child||
|person||



Step 2: Forming the Plurals of the Singular Nouns


 - Ask students to explain how to complete the remainder of the table by forming

the plural form of the nouns.

|Singular Noun|Plural Noun|
|---|---|
|book|books|
|puppy|puppies|
|knife|knives|
|child|children|
|person|people|
|**Challenge Word:** across|**Challenge Word:** across|
|**Challenge Word:** idea|**Challenge Word:** idea|



 - Explain to students that the Challenge Words _across_ and _idea_ are used very

often. They may not follow spelling patterns, and need to be memorized. Use

the Challenge Words in sentences as examples for students. “Maggie went

_across_ the street to play with Simon.” “I have no _idea_ what the answer is.”


 - Tell students that they will not need to change the form of the Challenge Words

on the assessment.


 - Tell students to turn to Activity Page 11.1. Have students circle the spelling

words on the backside. Tell students they will take home Activity Page 11.1 to

share with a family member.

**Note:** Quickly review spelling rules for singular and plural nouns (applying

suffixes). Distribute the decodable passage, “All About the Bones in Your Ears,”

that you prepared in advance to practice decoding suffix spellings. Write target

words from the decodable text on the board. Have students apply syllable

division pattern knowledge to decode words in isolation prior to reading

the decodable text. Read the first paragraph aloud to model fluent reading.

Then, put students into partner pairs to practice reading the decodable

passage. While students read, circulate to monitor fluent reading and provide

informational feedback.


Check for Understanding


Practice the words during the remaining time. Call on a student to read
any word in its plural form, and ask them to orally use the word in a
meaningful sentence. After the student says the sentence, have them ask
the class: “Did that sentence make sense?” If the class says, “Yes,” then
the student puts a check mark in front of the word and calls on another
student to come to the front and take a turn. If the class says, “No,” have
the student try again, or call on another student to come to the front and
use the word in a meaningful sentence. This continues until all the plural
forms are used or time has run out.

~~**INTRODUCING SUBJECT PRONOUNS (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that nouns are the names of people, places, or things.


 - Remind students that the subject of a sentence is who or what the sentence is

about, and often comes first in the sentence.


 - Tell students that today, they will learn about a new part of speech called

a pronoun.


 - Direct students’ attention to the poster you created in advance defining

pronouns and subject pronouns, or project Digital Projection DP.U3.L12.1 .

 - **Projection DP.U3.L12.1**








 - Have students read the poster, noting that “a pronoun is a word that takes the

place of a noun.”


 - Point out that when a pronoun is used to replace a noun that is the subject of

the sentence, it is called a subject pronoun. ( _Don reads well._ becomes _He_

_reads well_ .)


 - Direct students’ attention to the Subject Pronouns Chart you placed on the

board or chart paper, and read the subject pronouns. You will need to leave this

care of me.



Lesson 12 Beyond Sight and Sound
**273**


**274**




- Note for students that pronouns can be singular or plural. Ask students to

provide oral examples of singular and plural nouns (e.g., _cat, ball, desk, pencils,_

_books, cars_, etc.). After each noun is provided, ask students to verbally identify

which pronoun(s) could be used to replace the noun, emphasizing the fact

that if a noun is singular, the pronoun used to replace it must also be singular.


- Direct students’ attention to the sentences you placed on the board

in advance.


- Ask a student to read the first sentence. ( _Samuel watches the skaters_ .)


- Ask another student to identify the subject.


» _Samuel_


- Ask a third student, “How do you know _Samuel_ is the subject of the sentence?”


» _Samuel_ is what the sentence is about.


- Ask students which subject pronoun from the list you placed on the board

replaces _Samuel_ .


» _he_




» _He watches the skaters._


- Ask students whom the pronoun _he_ refers to, i.e., what noun it replaces.


» _Samuel_


- Point out to students that every pronoun refers to a noun. Whenever they read a

sentence that includes a pronoun, students should double check and make sure

they understand to whom or what the pronoun refers.


- Then, ask a student to insert their name in the next sentence and tell which

subject pronoun would replace their name.


» _Student’s name skated quickly_ . becomes _I skated quickly_ .


- Call on students to complete the next two sentences.


- For the fifth sentence, call on a pair of students to come up to the front of the

room. Have them face one another and speak to each other.


- Ask one of the students to insert their partner’s name in the sentence

( _Alice came too_ .) and replace that name with the correct subject pronoun

( _You came too_ .).


- Then, call four students up to the front of the room. Choose one to point to the

other students and insert the other three students’ names in the last sentence

( _Sally, Jim, and Fred skate well_ .), and then replace those names with the

correct subject pronoun ( _You skate well_ .).


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


- Lastly, have students read the final two sentences, replacing the subjects with

the appropriate subject pronoun ( _she_ ). Ensure students understand that the

subject pronoun in each of these sentences ( _she_ ) replaces all the words of the

|subject in each sentence (my sister and|d your mother), not just the noun.|
|---|---|
|My sister fell and hurt her knee.|She fell and hurt her knee.|
|Your mother is waving to all of us.|She is waving to all of us.|

Pausing Point 2


Note to Teacher


This is the end of _The Human Body: Systems and Senses_ unit. Students have

studied the systems and senses of the human body, including the muscular,

skeletal, nervous, digestive, circulatory, respiratory, and excretory systems.

They have also learned about the parts of the eye and the ear, and how those

parts function together to help us see and hear. Students have learned about

how to care for the different body systems through a well-balanced diet and

exercise. It is highly recommended that you pause here and spend a day

reviewing, reinforcing, or extending the material taught thus far.


You may have students do any combination of the activities listed below. The

activities may be done in any order. You may also choose to do an activity with

the whole class or with a small group of students who would benefit from the

particular activity.


~~**CORE CONTENT ADDRESSED IN THIS UNIT**~~


Students will:


 - Briefly describe and/or review seven of the systems of the human body


 - Explain that the human body includes the following systems and identify the

function of each: skeletal, muscular, and nervous


 - Identify cells as the basic building blocks of all living things and explain that

most cells are too small to be seen without a microscope


 - Explain the relationship between cells, tissues, organs, and systems


 - Explain that each system is made up of different types of cells (bone cells,

muscle cells, nerve cells, blood cells, etc.)


 - Explain that one of the systems of the human body is the skeletal system and

that it has two parts


 - Recall that there are 206 bones in the human body


 - Explain briefly the composition of bones


 - Identify examples of axial bones and explain their functions


 - Identify examples of appendicular bones and explain their functions


 - Identify three different types of joints and give examples of each: movable,

immovable, and partially movable


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


 - Describe how doctors are able to see and treat the skeletal system using

an x-ray


 - Explain the importance and purpose of cartilage


 - Identify skeletal, smooth, and cardiac as three types of muscles in the human

body and describe their functions


 - Compare and contrast involuntary and voluntary muscles


 - Explain that skeletal muscles work closely with bones to give the human

body mobility


 - Demonstrate familiarity with the legend of the Achilles heel/tendon


 - Identify the brain and spinal cord as the control center of the body


 - Identify nerves as messengers that transmit information from all of the parts

of the body through the spinal cord to the brain


 - Explain how the skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems are interconnected


 - Explain that the five senses work with the brain to process information about

our surroundings


 - Describe a reflex action as a quick, unconscious action and explain its purpose

in protecting the human body


 - Identify the parts of the brain and their functions: brain stem (medulla),

cerebrum, cerebellum


 - Describe the human brain as divided into two hemispheres and explain that

each hemisphere controls the muscles of the opposite side of the body


 - Identify the parts of the outer and inner eye and describe how they work

together with the brain to allow a person to see


 - Describe nearsightedness and farsightedness and how these can be corrected


 - Identify the parts of the outer, middle, and inner ear and describe how they

work together with the brain to allow a person to hear


 - Explain that cochlear implants can help some people who cannot hear

 - Identify ways to take care of the human body


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Writing a Narrative: Publish**


**(Activity Pages PP.2 and PP.3)**


 - Have students take out Activity Page PP.2 and PP.3. Remind them that they

have completed the editing step of the writing process for their narratives,

including the substep of creating the final copy. Tell students that they will now


Pausing Point 2
**285**


**286**



complete the publishing step of the writing process. Explain that this means

they will create a presentation of their narratives to share.


- Remind students that they completed the publishing step together in

previous units. Remind students that there are many ways to publish their

writing. For example, some students may wish to use technology to add

computer graphics such as illustrations, text boxes, and sidebars to aid in the

presentation of information. Some students may wish to create a PowerPoint

presentation. Other students may wish to create an artistic “book” format of

their narratives—as excerpts or as a whole—perhaps with handwritten text

and/or handmade illustrations.


- Encourage students to be creative. You may wish to have students share their

published narratives with the class, school, and/or community. You may also

wish to use Activity Page PP.3 to assess students’ formal writing.


**Note:** You may wish to model this step of the writing process for some

students who are not ready to complete it independently. You may also wish

to have some students work with partners or in groups. You may need to

take more than one day to complete this step of the writing process, as the

narrative is longer than other genres previously taught.


**The Human Eye**


**Materials:** Activity Page PP.4


- As a class, complete a brief image review. Flip through the images from the

Read-Aloud, “Vision: The Parts of the Eye,” focusing on the images that discuss

the parts of the eye. Have students take out Activity Page PP.4. Have students

label the parts of the human eye. You may wish to have students complete this

instructional page independently, with a partner, or as a group.


**Note:** This exercise is essential preparation for the Unit Assessment. It is

highly recommended that students practice labeling the parts of the eye

independently or with a partner during this Pausing Point.


**The Human Ear**


**Materials:** Activity Page PP.5


- Complete a brief image review. Flip through the images from the Read-Aloud,

“Hearing: The Parts of the Ear,” focusing on the images that discuss the parts

of the ears. Have students take out Activity Page PP.5. Have students label

the parts of the human ear. You may wish to have students complete this

instructional master independently, with a partner, or as a group.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


**Note:** This exercise is essential preparation for the Unit Assessment.

It is highly recommended that students practice labeling the parts of the

ear independently or with a partner during this Pausing Point.


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


**Materials:** Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


 - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _eyeball_ . Have

them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word,

such as iris, pupil, cornea, optometrist, etc. Record their responses on a piece

of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard for reference.


**Multiple-Meaning Word Activity: Pupil**


**Materials:** Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


 - Use a _Multiple Choice_ activity to review the word _pupil_ .


1. In the unit you heard “At the center of the iris is a black circle . . . called the

pupil.” Here, a pupil is a small, black opening in the center of the colored

part of the eye. [On chart paper, a chalkboard, or whiteboard, write “A—eye

part.” Tell students this is definition A.]


2. The word _pupil_ can also mean a child or young student in school. We

sometimes refer to students as pupils. [Write “B—young student.”] Tell

students this is definition B.


3. The word _pupil_ might also refer to one who has been taught by a famous or

important person, as in this sentence: “Fredrik Hasselquist was a pupil of

the father of taxonomy, Carolus Linnaeus.” [Write “C—taught by important

person.”] Tell students this is definition C.


 - Now have students form partners to quiz each other on the different meanings

of the word _pupil_ . Remember to be as descriptive as possible and use

complete sentences. For example, you could say, “After my brother’s visit with

the eye doctor, his pupils were so large that they looked like cat eyes.” And

your partner should respond, “That’s the ‘A’ definition of pupil—eye part.”


Pausing Point 2
**287**


**288**



**Riddles for Core Content**


- Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


   - I am a small tunnel in your ear. You can find wax inside of me. What am I?

(ear canal)


   - We are the three smallest bones in the human body and are located in the

middle ear. What are we? (hammer, anvil, and stirrup)


   - I am the largest part of your brain, controlling and managing language,

memory, thought, sensations, and decision-making. What am I?

(cerebrum)


   - I am about as thick as your thumb, and am three inches long. I help relay

messages between your brain and spinal cord. What am I? (brain stem)


   - I can become larger and smaller, depending on the amount of light. What

am I? (pupil)


   - I am rubbery, flexible, and transparent. I adjust shape in order to focus on

near or distant objects. What am I? (the eye lens)


   - You may also wish to review Ricardo’s riddles from the Read-Alouds to

review content.


- Have students create their own riddles.


**Class Book: The Human Body: Systems and Senses**


**Materials:** Drawing paper, drawing tools


- Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to finish their class

book to help them remember what they have learned in this unit about human

body systems. Have students brainstorm important information about the

human body’s systems, as well as information about the eye and the ear. They

should also think about how they can keep their bodies healthy through diet

and exercise. Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture of, and ask

them to write a caption for the picture. Bind the pages to make a book to put in

the class library for students to read again and again.


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


**Writing Prompts**


 - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as one of

the following:


    - The most interesting thing I’ve learned is because . . .


    - One way I can keep my body healthy is . . .


    - Something I would like to learn more about is because . . .


    - Without my brain, I could not . . .


    - I would compare and contrast the skeletal, muscular, and nervous

systems by. . .


**Brain Action**


 - Review that the brain is divided into two hemispheres. Review which

hemisphere controls each side of the body. If time allows, review the different

parts of the brain (brain stem, cerebrum, cerebral cortex, cerebellum).

Perhaps carry this activity into outdoor time, having students play catch.

The person receiving the ball reacts to catch it at the last minute. In this way,

students can assess the close relationship between the sense of seeing, and

the response/coordination of the muscle, skeletal, and nervous systems in

response. Reinforce unit-related vocabulary throughout the activity.


**Guest Presenter**


 - Invite the physical education teacher or school nutritionist to come to the

class and read a book or give a presentation on how students can keep their

bodies healthy. Parents or guardians who work in the exercise and nutrition

industries (trainers, physical therapists, dieticians, etc.) would also be

good sources.


**Song: “Dry Bones”**


 - Find a recording of the song “Dry Bones.” Have students listen to the song

once or twice, and encourage them to point to the various body parts

mentioned in the song. After listening to the song, have students discuss the

more technical names for the bones they learned about in the Read-Alouds, ;

e.g., the “head bone” as the skull or cranium; the “back bone” and “neck bone”

as the spine or spinal column; the “thigh bone” as the femur; the “knee bone”

as a hinge joint.


 - Ask students, “The skull and spine are both called what types of bones?”

(axial bones) Ask, “What is another name for the bones in the legs and arms


Pausing Point 2
**289**


**290**



that hang off of the axial skeleton?” (appendicular bones) Reinforce how

the different body parts mentioned in the song are interconnected. Explain

that the bones inside our bodies are not actually dry. Ask students why they

think that is.


**Note:** If your school has a music teacher, you may want to collaborate with

the teacher to teach this song to your students.


**Research Activity: Taking Care of the Human Body**


**Materials:** Locally approved sources


Give students the opportunity to research how they can take care of their

bodies. They may research what a well-balanced diet should consist of, and

the types of exercises they can do on their own. Allow students the time to

share their findings within a group or to the class.


**Sources of Sound**


**Materials:** Bell


Have students use their sense of hearing to guess from which direction a

sound is coming. Invite students to stand in a circle. Have one student close

their eyes and place them in the center of the circle. Ask the student with

their eyes closed to guess which classmate spoke and where the student is

standing. For a variation, you might have a student ring a bell or clap. Have the

student with their eyes closed describe the sound that is being made and try

to guess what is making the sound. Explain to students that they are hearing

sound waves that travel through the air and reach their ears.

 - Students will complete an assessment by reading two selections during one

sitting and answering comprehension, grammar, morphology, and spelling

questions that follow each selection. Students will not read out of their Reader,

but rather from Activity Page 13.1, where the selections have been printed.


 - Have students tear out Activity Page 13.1.


 - Tell students they will read two selections from Activity Page 13.1 and answer

comprehension, morphology, spelling, and grammar questions that follow

each selection.


 - Tell students that if they feel tired, it’s a good idea to take a short, personal

break. Explain to students that they need to respect others in the classroom

and stay seated, while quietly looking up to the ceiling, stretching their

shoulders, or taking a deep breath or two.


 - Tell students they should go right on to the second selection once they have

finished the first selection.


 - Encourage students to do their best.


 - Once students finish the assessment, encourage them to review their

papers, rereading and looking over their answers carefully.


 - Again, explain the necessity of respecting that not all classmates will finish at

the same time, and, if they finish and have checked their papers, they should

remain quiet for others to finish.


Note to Teacher

~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT (25 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


Assess students’ fluency in reading using any of the supplemental chapters

that they have not yet read. Recording and Scoring Sheets have been

specifically included for “Reflexes.”


**Instructions**


 - Turn to the text copy of “Reflexes” at the end of this lesson. This is the text

copy students will read aloud.

 - Ask the student to remove Activity Page 13.2 from their workbook. You will

use this activity page to mark as a running record as you listen to the student

read aloud.

 - Tell the student that you are going to ask them to read the selection aloud.

Explain that you are going to keep a record of the amount of time it takes to

read the selection. Encourage the student to read at their own regular pace.

 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. If you are

using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your

record page. If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down

the Start Time since it will calculate Elapsed Time. As the student reads the

selection, keep a running record on the copy with the student’s name using

the following guidelines:

|Words read correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion was<br>made. If you have time, write down the word that<br>was inserted.|
|**Words read incorrectly**|Write an “X” above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-corrected errors**|Replace original error mark with an “SC.”|
|**Teacher-supplied words**|Write a “T” above the word (counts as an error).|



**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.



Activity Pages 13.2



Lesson 13 Unit Assessment
**295**


**296**




 - When the student finishes reading the selection, write the exact Finish Time

in minutes and seconds on your record sheet. Alternatively, if you are using

a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. In

the interest of time, ask students to read only the first three pages of text in

either chapter. (Five minutes should be enough time to get a measurement

on most students.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical

line on the record sheet to indicate how far they read. Also write down either

the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time. After the student finishes reading

orally, you may direct them to finish reading the remainder of the selection

silently; you may also assess comprehension by having students answer the

following comprehension questions orally.


**Oral Comprehension Questions on “Reflexes”**


1. **Literal.** What did the teacher do to startle the students?


» dropped a huge book on the floor


2. **Literal.** Why did he do this?


» to test their reflexes


3. **Literal.** What kind of test did Mr. Brown say this was?


» a test you can pass without even trying


4. **Literal.** How do reflexes help keep us safe?


» They react without us thinking about it, thus protecting our body.


 - Repeat this process for additional students. Scoring can be done later,

provided you have kept running records and jotted down either the Elapsed

Time or the Start Time, and the Finish Time.


**Guidelines for Calculating W.C.P.M. Scores**


If the reading was fairly accurate (< 10 uncorrected errors), you can get a

rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the

time and looking at the chart on Activity Page 13.2.


To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote

down on the record sheet and follow the steps described below. The steps

are also shown in graphic form on Activity Page 13.2. You will probably find it

helpful to use a calculator.


1. First, complete the Words section of Activity Page 13.2.


2. Count Words Read. This is the total number of words the student read or

attempted to read, up to the point where he or she stopped. It includes words


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


the student read correctly, as well as words the student read incorrectly or

skipped over. If the student attempted to read the whole selection, use 334

words total. If the student did not finish the selection, you will need to count

the number of words the student actually attempted to read. Write the count

for Words Read in the matching box on Activity Page 13.2.


3. Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This includes

words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that you had to

supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes on Activity

Page 13.2. (A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted as a

mistake; the student is penalized for the time they lost making the correction,

but not for the initial mistake.)


4. Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


5. Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


6. Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,

this was done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a watch and

recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the Start Time

from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract seconds

from seconds and then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in Seconds.

Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to seconds, and

then add the number of seconds.


7. Next, complete the W.C.P.M. section of the activity page.


8. Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get Words

Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider.


It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.

scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with sufficient

fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of school

assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary from state to

state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in 2006 for Fall

of Grade 3 was 71 W.C.P.M.


A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the scores of other students

in the classroom (or grade level), and also with the national fluency norms for

Fall of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal. Students whose scores are

below the 25th percentile (44 W.C.P.M) are experiencing serious problems in

reading fluently.

where the ‘f’ changes to ‘v’ and – _es_ is added. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.11.D.iii**~~


~~**SPELLING ASSESSMENT (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity 13.4 for the spelling assessment.


 - If you would like students to have pens, this is the time to pass them out.


 - Tell students they will complete the assessment in two parts. For Part A,

tell students the root word and then provide an oral sentence with a blank

where a form of the root word will go. Students have to decide what form of

the verb is needed and write the correct spelling on their assessment. Tell

students that at the end, you will go back through the sentences once more.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words; **TEKS**
**3.12.B** Compose informational texts, including brief compositions that convey information about a topic, using a clear central
idea and genre characteristics and craft; **TEKS 3.11.D.iii** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including: singular,
plural, common, and proper nouns.

 - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all

assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


1. (raise) I my hand yesterday to volunteer to read stories to

the kindergarteners.


2. (dry) This morning, her hair more quickly than mine because it is

shorter.


3. (watch) Yesterday, my dad a football game on television.


4. (submit) I am my report as soon as I finish typing it up on the computer.


5. (wish) Last year, my brother for a new bike for his birthday.


 - After you have provided all of the oral sentences for Part A, go back through

the sentences slowly, reading each one just once more.


 - Tell students they will move on to Part B. For Part B, tell students the singular

noun and then provide an oral sentence with a blank where a form of the

word will go. Students have to decide what form of the word is needed and

write the correct spelling on their assessment.


 - Tell students that at the end, you will go back through the sentences once more.


1. (knife) I need a to cut my steak.


2. (puppy) The neighbor’s dog had three last week.


3. (book) My sister likes to read mystery and see if she can solve them.


4. (person) There were three waiting when I walked into the dentist’s office.


5. (child) There are 16 on my soccer team.


 - After you have called out all of the sentences, go back through the sentences

slowly, reading each one just once more.


 - Now, call out the Challenge Words: _across, idea_ .


 - Ask students to write the following sentences as you dictate them:


1. The people were hurrying to get their children to the bus stop.


2. Sam looked out his window and saw two men raking leaves down the street.


 - After students have finished, collect pens, if used.


 - Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

- Tell students that you will now show them the correct spelling for each word

so that they can correct their own work with their pencil.


- Starting with Part A, say the oral sentence again and write the correct form

of the word on the board. Instruct students to correct their work by crossing

out any incorrect spelling, then copying and writing the correct spelling next

to it. Follow the same procedures for Part B.


- Continue through all the words and then on to the dictated sentences.


Note to Teacher:


At a later time today, you may find it helpful to use the template provided

at the end of this lesson to analyze students’ mistakes. This will help you

understand any patterns that are beginning to develop or that are persistent

among individual students.


**Spelling Analysis Directions**


- Students are likely to make the following errors:


   - not dropping the final letter ‘e’ before adding – _ed_, – _ing_, and/or – _es_


   - not changing the ‘y’ to ‘i’ before adding – _es_


   - not changing the ‘f’ to ‘v’ before adding – _es_


   - writing irregular plurals incorrectly since they do not follow a pattern


- While any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still

be aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it

helpful to record the actual spelling errors the student makes in the analysis

chart. For example:


   - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


   - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?


   - Is the student consistently making errors at the ends of the words?


   - Is the student consistently making errors on particular

beginning consonants?


- Did the students write words for each feature correctly?


- Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization

and punctuation.


- Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

**Reflexes**


The students in the class were talking among themselves. None of them were

paying attention to their science teacher, Mr. Brown.


Mr. Brown walked over to his bookshelf. He took a huge book off the shelf. It

was a dictionary. It weighed about five pounds. He held the book out with two

hands. Then, he let it fall.


SMACK!


The book slammed against the floor.


The students were startled. Sally almost jumped out of her chair. Ned

twitched. Jimbo blinked and shook his head. Susan was so scared she

shouted, “What?”


The students turned to look at Mr. Brown. Some of them look shocked. Some

of them looked annoyed.


“What’s the deal, Mr. Brown?” Susan said. “Why did you drop that book?”


“I was testing your reflexes,” said Mr. Brown.


“What?” said Ned. “Did you say test? Do we have a test today? Oh, man! I am

going to fail! I totally forgot to study!”


Mr. Brown smiled. “Don’t worry, Ned. This is a test you can pass without

even trying!”


“Cool!” said Ned. “That’s my kind of test!”


“You see,” Mr. Brown explained, “that’s the thing about reflexes. You don’t have

to think about them. A reflex is something you just do without thinking. Sally,

when I dropped that book, did you think, Goodness! A loud noise! I think I will

show how surprised I am by jumping out of my seat?”


“No,” said Sally. “I don’t remember thinking anything at all.”


“Exactly,” said Mr. Brown. “That’s how reflexes work. If you touch a hot stove,

you don’t want to have to think things out. You want to be able to react right

away, without having to think about it. This is one of the ways in which your

nervous system keeps you safe. Your nerves are always on the lookout. They

react, on their own, to loud noises. They feel vibrations. They sense heat. Your

nervous system is like a watchdog that never sleeps. It is always protecting

you and your body.”

Lesson 11: “All About the Bones in Your Ears”


Decodable Passages The Human Body
**309**


**Unit 3 | Lesson 1 and 6**
**How Do Your Skeleton and Your Joints**
**Help You Walk?**





You probably do something difficult every day without even

thinking about it. You walk!


People are the only mammals that usually walk on two feet.

Adults and children all walk on two feet. Other mammals, like

wolves, sheep, and deer, walk on four. Some mammals, like

bears, can balance on two feet. They might even walk a few

steps. But it isn’t the main way they get around.


Can you think of any other animals that _always_ walk on two

feet? Here’s a hint: _Honk!_ That’s right—geese. In fact, all birds





**310**



walk (or hop, or waddle) on two feet.


Babies don’t walk. They crawl until the first or second year of their lives. They have to learn to

walk. It takes a lot of practice. It also takes a lot of falling down. The muscles in their legs and feet

have to get stronger.


Wiggle your toes. Spread them out wide. Point and flex your foot. Rotate it in a circle. Your feet

and ankles can move in many different ways. The calf—the big muscle below your knee on the

back of the leg—helps your feet move. If you touch your calves, you can feel them working as you

move your feet and toes.


Why do you think your feet and toes need to move in so many different ways? One reason is

that you move in many ways. You walk, run, jump, and dance. You go forward and backward and

sideways. That takes balance. It takes flexibility. The bones in your feet form three different

arches. These help your feet respond to changes in the ground you walk on. The joints in each of

your legs—ankle, knee, and hip—also help. If you step on a small pebble, you don’t fall over.


Walking takes strength too. Your legs are heavy—about a third of your total body weight. When

you walk or run, your feet take a beating. Multiply your body weight times three—that’s how

much force is landing on your feet with every step when you run. Did you know your feet were

that strong?


Unit 3 The Human Body: Systems and Senses


**Unit 3 | Lesson 11**
**All About the Bones in Your Ears**





You can see and feel the shapes of some of your bones. If you

watch your fingers moving, you can see where the different

bones begin and end. By putting your hand on your knee, you

might be able to feel your patella, or kneecap, as you bend and

straighten your leg to raise your foot.


But you have other bones that are covered. You can’t see them

or touch them. Three of these bones are inside each of your

ears. They’re the smallest bones in the human body. These

bones help people hear.





The hammer bone is next to your eardrum. The eardrum vibrates, or moves back and forth

quickly, when a sound enters the ear. When that shaking reaches the hammer, the hammer

shakes too. It shakes in a way that increases the vibrations.


Next to the hammer is the anvil bone. An anvil is a hard metal surface that a blacksmith strikes.

A blacksmith is a person who melts iron and uses tools to make metal objects like horseshoes.

The bones look a little bit like a hammer and anvil. When the hammer vibrates, the anvil starts to

vibrate too. Although it is smaller than the hammer, the anvil amplifies the vibrations even more.


The vibrations reach the tiniest bone of all, the stirrup. It is shaped like the stirrup on a saddle. At

its end is a membrane, which connects to the inner ear. The stirrup carries the vibrations to the

fluid in the inner ear. Waves in this fluid reach the hairlike cells in the cochlea. (Remember, the

cochlea is the bony, snail-shaped tube in the inner ear.) The cells translate the waves into nerve

signals. When the signals reach your brain, you hear the sound!


That’s a complicated process. But it happens lightning-fast, without you ever having to think

about it.
