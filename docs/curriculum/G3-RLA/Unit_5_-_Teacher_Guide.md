**Grade 3 | Unit 5**
Introduction


~~**FLASH, BANG, BOOM! EXPLORING LIGHT AND SOUND**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the Flash, Bang, Boom!

Exploring Light and Sound unit. This unit contains 16 daily lessons, plus two Pausing Point days that

may be used for differentiated instruction. Each lesson will require a total of 120 minutes. Lesson 14

contains the Unit Assessment.


As noted, two days are intended to be used as Pausing Point days. These Pausing Points are

embedded into the instruction at appropriate points, with the first one after Lesson 7 and the second

after Lesson 16. You may choose to continue to the next lesson and schedule the first Pausing

Point day for another day in the unit sequence. Pausing Points can be used to focus on content

understanding, writing, spelling, grammar, morphology skills, or fluency.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS**~~


**Reading**


The nonfiction Reader for Unit 5, _Adventures in Light and Sound_, consists of selections describing the

science behind light and sound. Students will read about light sources, shadows, mirrors, reflection,

refraction, lenses, and color. They will also study the characteristics of sound, as well as the human

voice. Later chapters include information about light and photography as well as biographies of two

famous inventors who worked with light and sound: Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison. It

is important that you discuss the characteristics of the biography genre and stress that biographies

are nonfiction since they are factual accounts of people’s lives. Students will be given opportunities

throughout the unit to demonstrate read-aloud fluency.


**Spelling**


During this unit’s spelling exercises, students will review words with spelling patterns of /ee/ spelled

‘y,’ ‘e,’ ‘i,’ ‘ea,’ ‘ee,’ ‘ie,’ ‘ey’ and ‘e_e’. For Lessons 6–10, students will review words with spelling patterns

of /ae/ spelled ‘ay,’ ‘ai,’ and ‘ea’. Finally, in Lessons 11–15, students will review words with spelling

patterns of /ae/ spelled ‘a_e,’ and ‘a.’ Students will have two Challenge Words and one Content word

added to each spelling list.


You will also continue to teach dictionary skills. As this unit progresses, students should become

proficient in the application of guide words.


Introduction
**1**


**Grammar**


In grammar, students will review a part of speech introduced at the end of Grade 2: adverbs ending

with _–ly_ that tell how an action takes place. They will go further in their study of adverbs by examining

those that indicate when and where. Students will be introduced to conjunctions as a new part of

speech. They will learn the meanings and usages of the conjunctions _and_ and _but._


**Morphology**


During the morphology portion of the lessons, students will review the suffixes _–er, –or, –ist, –ian, –y,_

and _–al_ . In addition, students will learn the suffixes _–ous_ and _–ly_ . They will review how suffixes change

the meaning of root words. They will also review how suffixes added to a word can change the part of

speech of that word.


~~**WHY THE LIGHT AND SOUND UNIT IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will build upon what students have already learned about the five senses and the human

body, focusing on the senses of seeing and hearing. Through reading and listening to Read-Alouds,

students will learn about the properties of light and sound, how light and sound travel in waves,

and how light and sound can be manipulated by various instruments, such as magnifying glasses,

microscopes, and telescopes. The content students learn in this grade will serve as the basis in later

grades for more in-depth study of the human body and the properties of light and sound.


Students will be introduced to this content through a narrative story about two old friends, Samuel

and Jack, who are losing their senses of sight and hearing, and their adventures with Samuel’s

grandchildren, Amy and Ethan. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures

used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher

Resources.


**Note:** Light has both a wave and a particle nature. Under most circumstances, light acts like a

series of waves. However, there are certain, less common situations where light acts like a stream

of particles.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**2**


At the Grade 3 level, we concentrate on the wave nature of light, briefly mentioning that “scientists are

still studying and learning many new things about light, including that in special situations, light can

act like a stream instead of a wave.” Students will learn more about the dual wave and particle nature

of light in future grades.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunites for students

to build content knowledge and draw connections to science and social studies. You may build on

class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Force,

Motion, and Energy, Scientific and Engineering Practices, and Recurring Themes and Concepts from

the Science TEKS and Science, Technology, and Society from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is

not a replacement for grade-level science or social studies content.


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program will have pertinent background knowledge for

this unit. For students who have not received prior instruction in the program, introductory knowledge

is addressed at the beginning of each unit.


The Five Senses (Kindergarten)


The Human Body (Grade 1)


Astronomy: Space Exploration (Grade 1)


Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops (Grade 2)


Introduction

~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students have many opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for different purposes. The formal

writing piece for the _Light and Sound_ unit is a multi-day research and informative writing project that

focuses on writing a newspaper article about the invention of either the telephone or the incandescent

light bulb. Students will learn to conduct research, take and organize notes, and use the writing

process to plan, draft, revise, edit and publish the final newspaper article. The project can be done with

or without the use of technology. If student are using computers to research, please monitor closely.


Everyday writing opportunities come in many forms, including short and extended responses requiring

evidence from the text. Students will also use graphic organizers to gather and categorize information

from reading or from the Read-Aloud, or to plan for writing. Many lessons provide opportunities for

students to collaborate, share ideas, and give feedback on their writing.


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving

appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete

activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**PERFORMANCE TASKS AND ASSESSMENTS**~~


The Primary Focus objectives in each lesson are carefully structured and sequenced throughout the

unit to help build student understanding. Additionally, formative assessments are provided to help

keep track of their progress toward objectives and standards. These can be found in the Student

Activity Book and are referenced in every lesson.


While some units in Grade 3 have extended Performance Task assessments, _Light and Sound_ has a

Unit Assessment covering the content of the unit, reading objectives taught throughout the unit, as

well as grammar and morphology assessment.


**TEKS 3. 2. D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound

~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This

component was created to accompany materials for Grade 3. It consists of selections from a variety

of genres, including poetry, folklore, and fables. These selections provide additional opportunities

for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). For more information on

implementation, please consult the supplement.


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL COMPONENTS**~~


**Teacher Resources**


There are 18 Image Cards in your kit that include pictures to augment instruction of the Light and

Sound Unit.


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled, “Teacher Resources.” In this section you

will find the following:


 - Glossary for the _Light and Sound_ unit


 - Decodable Passages


 - Activity Book Answer Key


 - Measures of Text Complexity


 - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


 - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


**Digital Resources**


In the Advance Preparation section of each lesson, you will be directed to prepare to project images

associated with the Read-Aloud portion of the lesson. These can be found in the program’s online materials.

~~**READING: “WHAT IS LIGHT?” (30 MIN.)**~~


                       - Read the title of the chapter together as a class: “What Is Light?”


                       - Ask, “Where in the Reader could we find the definition of _source_ quickly?”


» the glossary


                       - Ask, “How do you find the word in the glossary?” Call on one student to
identify where the word is and read the definition.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound

**Pages 2–3**

  - Have students read **page 2** to themselves to find out more about energy.


  - When students have finished reading, ask them, “What do you think of when
you think of something with a lot of energy?”


» Answers may vary.


  - I’m going to reread this sentence from **page 2** : “Believe it or not, light can
be many times more energetic than a car or the wind.” Ask students to raise
their hands if they found this fact surprising.


  - Direct students’ attention to the image and caption on **page 3** .


Lesson 1 What Is Light?, Part 1

**Pages 4–5**

                  - Tell students to read **page 4** to themselves.


                 - Ask students to describe light’s speed and how it compares to the speed of
other things.


» Light travels at 186,000 miles every second in a vacuum, and at that speed, it can

go around Earth more than seven times every second. Not even a jet plane or a

rocket can go that fast.


                       - Discuss the concept of measuring light in waves and wavelengths, referring
to the image and caption on **page 5** .


                       - Ask, “Can we see all kinds of light?”


» No, some light waves are visible and some are invisible.


                       - Ask, “What determines whether light can be seen?”


» wavelengths


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**14**


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** “What does light have to do with wavelengths?”
Teacher should circulate while students share briefly. Answers will vary
but should include light can be measured in wavelengths, wavelengths
can be different sizes, some wavelengths are visible and some are not,
depending on the size. Students can use both the text and the illustrations

**15**


The sun gives off what is called **white light** .
Perhaps you think of the light from the sun as
having no color at all. Maybe you think the light
from the sun is more yellow in color. It may surprise
you to know that the sun’s light, **white light**, is
made up of all the colors of the rainbow. **White**
**light** includes light of different **wavelengths**,
including all the colors we can see.

Of all the **wavelengths** in the sun’s light, there
is just a little more of the yellow **wavelengths** that
reach our eyes than the other colors. This is why the
sun looks yellow when we see it against the blue
sky. Still, the light from the sun includes all of the
other colors and **wavelengths** . You will learn more
about **white light**, visible light, and colors in a later
chapter in this Reader.


_**White light**_ _is a well-balanced mix of different_ _**wavelengths**_ _._

**Pages 6–7**

                 - Have students read **page 6** to themselves to find the answer to the question:

“What is white light?” When students have finished reading, restate the
question and call on a student to answer.


» White light is the type of light that comes from the sun. It includes wavelengths of

every visible color.


                 - Point out to students that even though the kind of light coming from the sun

is white light, the sun itself looks yellow. Ask students to find the sentence
that explains why that’s true.


» There is a little more of the yellow wavelengths than the other wavelengths in the

sun’s light so the light looks yellow against a blue sky.


                 - Direct students’ attention to the image and caption on **page 7** .

**Pages 8–9**

  - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 9** . Have one student read the
caption to the class.


  - Ask students to read **page 8** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “What other sources of light can you think of, besides the sun?”


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer.


» Answers may vary but should include light bulbs, flashlights, candles, stars,

or fireflies.


  - Ask students, “What else in the sky, besides the sun, provides light and what
in the sky does not provide light?”


» Stars in the night sky provide light that is not as bright as the sun. The moon does

not give off its own light.

there are 8 different spellings for /ee/.


  - As you introduce each of the spelling words, write it on the board in cursive,

pronouncing each word as you write it. Model cursive handwriting, including
spacing and formation of letters.


  - Go back through the list of words, having students read the words and tell you
which letters to circle for the sound of /ee/. As the students list the different
spellings for /ee/, write the spelling patterns off to the side, making a list of
each spelling pattern found in the spelling words until all 8 patterns are found.

  - Point to the Challenge Words on the board. Explain to students that the

Challenge Words, _almost_ and _really,_ are also part of their spelling list and are
used very often. _Almost_ does not follow the spelling patterns for this week
but _really_ does, as the ‘ea’ and the ‘y’ in really are pronounced /ee/. Use the
Challenge Words in sentences as examples for students: “Bill ate _almost_ all of
his lunch.” “He _really_ was not very hungry.”

from Unit 4. Ask students to refer to the spelling alternatives for /ee/ on the
**third page of their Individual Code Charts** . Point out that there are eight
spellings for /ee/. Note that with so many different spellings for /ee/, this is
often a difficult sound to spell correctly.


  - Ask students to tell you which words to list under the ‘y’ < /ee/ header.
Briefly explain the meaning of each word.


  - Continue through the columns until all words have been listed under the
appropriate /ee/ header. Note that _tedious, really, and electricity_ go under
two headers. Briefly explain the meaning of each word.


  - Ask students to read the sentence you are writing on the board. Ask them to
listen for the /ee/ sound and write the word containing the correct spelling
pattern when they know it.


  - Model fluent reading of the /ee/ sound.

“I see you are already working,” replied Mr. Jack Audire [aw-dee

painting today?”


“Well, I am painting the roses that have just begun to bloom,” replied

Samuel. “I am taking advantage of the early morning sunlight. As you

know, my eyes are not what they used to be,” sighed Samuel. “Sadly, I

can only paint for an hour each day.”


“You will have to speak up, Samuel. I am a little hard of hearing, you

know,” said Jack with a laugh.


“How about we sit for a while under the oak tree?” replied Samuel.

“I have just made some lemonade. I am hot standing in the sunlight,

and my eyes are tired.”

Samuel and Jack walked slowly

toward the shade of the giant oak

and settled themselves into two

comfortable garden chairs. Samuel picked up a pitcher of ice-cold

lemonade and poured it into two sparkling glasses. Both men were

silent for a long while, until at last Samuel spoke.


“I have been pondering life,” said Samuel, speaking loudly so that

Jack could hear him. “I have such wonderful memories, and you are

in many of them.”


“I am glad to hear that,” said Jack. “Now that your eyes and my ears

are failing, we should strike a deal: I will be your eyes if you will be my

ears!” Jack exclaimed rather loudly.


The two men laughed. At that precise moment Samuel’s dog Alfie,

came to join them. Alfie stretched and yawned and then curled up in

the shade between the two friends.

giant oak. As he stood, he gazed out into his beautiful garden that

was bursting with color and scent and began to speak.


“Our main source of light and heat is the sun, a hot star of glowing

gas.” Samuel smiled as he went on. “Light illuminates objects and

makes them visible. Light spreads out in all directions. Because of

light, our eyes and our brains are able to form pictures of the world

we live in. I have spent my life painting those pictures. Light gives us

every sunrise and every sunset. Without light, there is only darkness.”


Jack stared up into the sky. “I’ve always wondered how

exactly light reaches us here on Earth. The sun is more than

92,000,000 miles away!”


Samuel nodded. “It is difficult to comprehend how it takes a mere

eight minutes for light from the sun to reach us here on Earth.”


“Light travels in the form of tiny waves called light waves,” explained

Samuel. “These light waves travel in straight paths called rays. Rays

of light waves travel at the fastest speed possible in a vacuum, a

place that has no tiny particles or bits of matter. Because most of

outer space has very few particles, it is a vacuum, and light travels

there at the remarkable speed of approximately 186,000 miles

a second!”

Jack sat shaking his head and then took a sip of the refreshingly cool

lemonade. “That is a lot to think about!” he admitted.


“It sure is,” agreed Samuel, smiling. “Scientists are still studying

and learning many new things about light, including that in special

situations, light can act like a stream instead of a wave.” Jack shook

his head. “Figuring out how light works must be complicated, but it is

indeed fascinating.”


- Show Image Card C.U5.L2.1. Tell students you can see the rays of light in this
image because they are shining on bits of dust and moisture in the air. Ask
if students have seen rays of the sun like these. When is the best time to see
them?


» at sunrise or sunset, or when it is partly cloudy


so quickly through outer space.

There is almost nothing to block its path. Once light reaches Earth’s

atmosphere, it slows down a little bit.”


~~_Why is there almost nothing to block the path of the light? (Space is_~~

~~_a vacuum.)_~~


”The atmosphere is like a blanket of air full of gases and moisture

that covers the Earth. This blanket of air slows the light down.”


~~_Point to the lemonade and the oak tree as you read the sentences_~~

~~_aloud. Point to the shadow in the image._~~


“Then,” Samuel continued, “the speed of light slows down even more

because objects start getting in the way of the light rays.” Samuel

pointed to the lemonade. “For example, rays of light waves move more

slowly when traveling through liquids, such as this lemonade.” Then

Samuel pointed to the oak tree. “Light waves cannot pass through

other objects, such as this beautiful oak tree. Because rays of light

waves travel in a straight line, they cannot bend around the tree,

either; instead, they leave a shadow, or shade, on the other side of it.”


“Well, I, like Alfie, am enjoying sitting in the cool shade where there is

clearly less light and heat,” pronounced Jack as he sipped his lemonade.


At that precise moment, as if he heard his name, Alfie leapt out from

under Samuel’s chair and jumped high into the air in pursuit of a

buzzing bumblebee. Both men stopped talking to watch the dog’s

frantic attempt to capture the bee, but to no avail. The bee seemed

to float away on the warm summer breeze, no doubt in search of a

sweetly scented flower to pollinate.


Energy from the sun supports all forms of life on this planet. Without

light and heat from the sun, the farmer would not have food to harvest.

In fact, we could not exist on Earth!”


~~_What do you see in Samuel’s garden that needs light to survive?_~~

~~_(grass, trees, flowers, people, animals, etc.)_~~


“Hmm, speaking of food!” exclaimed Jack.


“Yes, indeed,” said Samuel. “I think I have exhausted both of us, and it

is almost time for lunch. What do you say we go into the kitchen and

get something to eat?”


“I say that’s the best thing I’ve heard all day!” laughed Jack. “And I

smell something delicious coming from the house!”

**Show Image U5.L2.6:**
Samuel and Jack inside having lunch


The two men made their way into the

coolness of the kitchen and prepared

themselves a lunch of homemade

zucchini bread and fresh fruits and

vegetables gathered from Samuel’s garden. They sat at a table next to

the kitchen window and talked about old times as they ate their meal.


They recalled how they had first become friends in elementary school.

They had been in the same third-grade class together, and they had

both been keen baseball players. They had gone to high school together,

and then on to the same college where Samuel had studied art, and Jack

had studied music. They had even been soldiers together.


Eventually, Samuel and Jack had both married and had children.

Their wives became good friends, and their children grew up playing

with each other. Sadly, both of their wives had died. Their children

were now adults with children of their own.

**Show Image U5.L2.7:**
Samuel and Jack on porch at night


**Note:** Remind students to listen for

adjectives that have to do with light.


Before they knew it, several hours had

passed, and the bright sun had set.

Samuel and Jack were now sitting on the porch in the shimmering

twilight. Sounds of various night creatures were beginning to echo in

the still of the evening.


“It won’t be long before the stars are twinkling in the night sky and the

moon is shining brightly,” said Jack. “It is almost time for me to go.”


Samuel gazed silently at the emerging night sky. They sat together

enjoying the cooler evening air. Eventually, Samuel spoke.


~~_What adjectives did you hear that have to do with light? (bright,_~~

~~_shimmering, twinkling, night)_~~


**Show Image U5.L2.8:**
Jack and Samuel saying goodbye


“Isn’t it amazing that stars make their

own light, but the moon does not?

Sunlight bounces off the moon to

make it look like it’s shining brightly in

the night sky,” mused Samuel. “Of course, I could sit here all night and

talk about why light is so important, not only for myself as a painter,

but for our very existence,” he said contemplatively.

“That’s a fact,” replied Jack, smiling at his friend.


Samuel smiled, too.


“Jack, how about we go fishing tomorrow morning?” asked Samuel.


“Sounds good to me,” said Jack as he stood up to go. “As you know,

I am the better fisherman. It will be a miracle, Samuel Van Lumen, if

you catch a single fish!”


“We’ll see about that!” exclaimed Samuel as he watched his best

friend walk slowly down the garden path and through the creaky

garden gate.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** _Lumen_ means “light” in Latin. What word that you heard in

“What Is Light?” contains the root _lumen_ ?


» illuminates


2. **Evaluative.** How can understanding the Latin word _lumen_ help you define

the English word _illuminate_ ?


» Understanding that the root has to do with light helps us understand the meaning

of the word. If a flashlight or another light source illuminates an object, its light

shines on it.


3. **Evaluative.** Why do you think the author chose Van Lumen as Samuel’s

last name?


» His last name contains _lumen,_ which means light. Samuel is very interested in

and knowledgeable about light because he is a painter. He notices light when he

paints, and tries to show the qualities of light in his paintings.


4. **Evaluative.** Ask students to write their answers to this question on a piece

of notebook paper. Remind them to use their best cursive writing. How do

the characters in this narrative use their five senses and sensory organs to

experience the world around them?


» Answers may vary, but may include: They see the roses, garden, sun, Alfie, etc.,

with their eyes; they taste the lemonade and their lunch with their taste buds; they

smell the bread with their noses; they feel the sun and cool shade, glasses, etc.,

with their skin; they hear each other talking, Alfie barking, the buzzing bee, etc.,

with their ears. ~~**[ TEKS 3.6.F ]**~~

adding _–ly_ to an adjective.


  - Tell students that the suffix _–ly_ means “in a way,” with the blank being the
adjective that _–ly_ is added to. Adverbs with _–ly_ describe how the action of a
verb happens.

**Cut out cards and place in an envelope.**


I am an extraordinary kind of energy, and I travel as tiny waves. I am very
fast, but you cannot see me moving. What Am I? (light)


I am a source of light. Light energy starts with me. Light waves move out
from me and illuminate the area around me. You can see me but should
never, ever look right at me. What am I? (sun)


I don’t have my own light, but I shine brightly in the sky. You see
me mostly at night, but sometimes I peek out during the daytime.
What am I? (the moon)


I am formed in places where all of the light doesn’t reach. Sometimes
I am very dark, and sometimes only a little bit darker than what is
around me. Sometimes I take a shape similar to something nearby.
What am I? (shadow)


I begin at a light source and travel through the air. Sometimes you
can see me and sometimes you can’t. I show the way light travels in
a straight line. What am I? (a ray)


I am the way light travels. Sometimes I am long and sometimes I am short.
Sometimes I’m visible and sometimes I’m not. What am I? ( a wave)


I come from the sun and I carry all the colors of the rainbow.
What am I? (white light)


I am one of the characters in the story, and I am especially knowledgeable
about light. I love to paint, and I always notice the qualities of light and
shadows. I am slowly losing my vision, or sense of sight. Who am I? (Samuel)

**How Are**



**Shadows Made?**



Do you remember any interesting facts about
how light travels? In the last chapter, you learned
that it travels in waves that can be measured as
wavelengths. You also learned that it travels at a very
high rate of speed. Here’s another interesting fact—
light waves travel from a source in straight lines that
spread out in all directions, like rays, until they hit
another object.

Take a look at the image on the opposite page.
In this image, there are several light sources. Each
source or dot of light has several rays of light
shooting out. Put your finger on the source you can
see. Now, using your finger, trace the lines of light
coming out from that source. Each ray of light is a
straight line.


_Light travels in straight lines like rays from its source._


12 13


**Pages 12–13**

  - Ask students to look at the image on **page 13** .


  - Read the caption, “Light travels in straight lines like rays from its source.”


  - Remind students that in previous lessons, they learned that light can travel
in waves.


  - Ask students to read **page 12** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “What new information is there about how light waves travel?”


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have

students answer.


» Light waves travel in straight lines.


Lesson 3 How Are Shadows Made?
**49**


Have you ever wondered what happens when a
line or path of light bumps into something in its
way? Different things may happen depending on
what exactly is in the light’s path.

If a path of light hits something that is
**transparent**, most of the light will pass right
through. Air, water, and glass are all **transparent** .
When light hits these **transparent** objects, it passes
through to the other side. It is almost as if the object
isn’t there.

Most buildings have glass windows so that
natural sunlight can travel from the outdoors inside.
Have you ever been in a building that has a glass
roof or **skylight** ? Sometimes you can even see blue
sky and clouds through the **skylight** !

**Pages 14–15**



_How do you know that the glass in this_ _**skylight**_ _is_ _**transparent**_ _?_

Activity Page 3.3



Characteristics of genre are parts or elements of texts that distinguish one
type of genre of text from another. For example, informational texts include
key ideas and details.


Draw students’ attention to the image on page 15 and ask them to make a
prediction about a detail that supports a key idea in the text.


 - Ask students to look at the image on **page 15** and read the caption together.


 - Ask students to read **page 14** to themselves to find the answer to the
question in the caption.


 - When students have finished reading, reread the question in the caption and
have students answer.


» We know the glass in the skylight is transparent because light travels through it.

We can see the sky and the clouds. (When students answer, have them read the

text that supports their answer.)




- Have students turn to Activity Page 3.3



Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound

Light cannot travel through all materials. If a
path of light hits something that is **opaque**, the
light is **absorbed** and blocked by the object. It
cannot continue in a straight line through the
object. Wood, cardboard, and even a person’s body
are all **opaque** objects. Light cannot pass through to
the other side. Instead, a **shadow** is created because
the light is **absorbed** .

Look around your classroom. Do you see
**transparent** objects through which light is passing?
Can you also find **opaque** objects? You will
probably find that your classroom has many more
**opaque** objects than **transparent** objects. Do you
see any **shadows** ?


_Are people’s bodies_ _**transparent**_ _or_ _**opaque**_ _? How do you know?_


16 17


  - Together, fill in all the information in the row for _transparent._


  - Have students confirm or correct their predictions about the details in the
text. (the images support the idea that natural sunlight can travel from the
outdoors inside).

  - Ask students to look at the image on **page 17** and read the caption together.


  - Ask students to read **page 16** to themselves to find the answer to question in
the caption.


  - When students have finished reading, reread the question in the caption and
have students answer.


» People’s bodies are opaque. Light cannot pass through them so shadows are

formed. (Have them read the text that supports their answer.)


  - Together, fill in all the information in the row for _opaque_ on Activity Page 3.3.

- Remind students that adjectives describe nouns and adverbs describe verbs.
Adding _–ly_ to adjectives changes them to adverbs, which are words that
describe how the verb is completed.


- Display the first two sentences you prepared in advance.


- Ask students to read the first sentence to a partner (I took a quick shower.),
identifying the word _quick_ as an adjective that describes the word _shower_,
which is a noun. Mark the noun and adjective with the established symbols.


- Ask students to read the second sentence to a partner (We ran quickly to the
car when the storm started.), this time identifying the word _quickly_ as an
adverb that describes the verb ran. Mark the verb and adverb with the
established symbols.


- As students read, circulate, observe, and provide immediate feedback.


- Point out to students that it would be grammatically incorrect to say “we
ran quick” because the word that is being described is a verb. Ask them to
provide the correct form of the word for this sentence.

- Likewise, be sure that they understand that it would be grammatically
incorrect to say “I took a quickly shower” because the word being described
is a noun. Ask them to provide the correct form of the word for this sentence.

**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD :**
**“REFLECTIONS AND MIRRORS” (15 MIN.)**


**Show Image U5.L4.1:**
Jack walking toward Samuel and Alfie on
the pier


The next morning both men were up

bright and early, each one looking

forward to a day of fishing. Fishing had

become one of their most cherished pastimes, and they both enjoyed

fishing for striped bass. They had a favorite fishing spot on the

banks of the Hudson River, where Samuel arrived first. There, an old,

rickety, or wobbly, pier jutted out into the cool, lapping water. Nearby,

a row of silver birch trees provided just the right amount of shade.

There was also a picnic table. Alfie always accompanied them and

frequently scared the fish away by jumping off the pier into the water.


~~_Explain that the Hudson River is in New York, or show the location on a_~~

~~_US map._~~


“Hey, you beat me to it!” shouted Jack as he walked toward Samuel.

Samuel was already on the pier, intently focused on attaching a

large, juicy bloodworm to the hook on the end of his fishing line. Alfie

was stretched out, enjoying the sun and the gentle breeze that was

blowing across the Hudson River Valley.


“Just got here myself!” yelled back Samuel. “I hear the fish are

jumping right onto the line!”


“Well, they’ll miss your line, for sure!” bellowed Jack. Then he laughed

loudly to himself.


Samuel smiled at his friend and shook his head.

“If you continue to yell like a wild bear, you’ll scare away every living

creature, including the fish,” said Samuel.


“Ahh, the fish can’t hear me!” retorted Jack. ~~_Why do you think Jack is_~~

~~_speaking loudly? (Sometimes when people begin to lose their hearing_~~

~~_they speak loudly because they can’t hear themselves well.)_~~

For several minutes the two men were

silent. Samuel finished attaching the

worm to the hook on the end of his

line. Then he cast his line out into the smooth, glass-like surface of

the Hudson River and plunked himself down on the edge of the pier.

**Show Image U5.L4.3:**
Light hitting different objects


“Going back to what we were talking

about yesterday about light waves,”

said Samuel, “did you know that when

a light wave hits an object, three things

can happen? The light can be transmitted, or passed through the

object. The light can also be reflected, or bounced back off that object,

or the light can be absorbed, or soaked up into it. This is determined by

the type of object that the light wave hits. Sometimes the light does a

combination of these things.” ~~_Point to the objects in the image and have_~~

~~_students discuss which objects are transmitting and refecting light_~~

~~_(eyeglasses, glass) and which are absorbing light (tackle box)._~~


“Hmm,” Jack responded.


“Take reflection, for example,” continued Samuel eagerly. “Most

of the light that reaches our eyes is reflected light. You see, apart

from objects that produce their own light, such as the sun or a light

bulb, all other objects are visible because light waves from a source

bounce off them and into our eyes,” explained Samuel.

**64**


“If you recall, Samuel Van Lumen, I did go to school. For most of the

time we were in the same class,” said Jack somewhat grumpily. “I

remember learning about bioluminescent creatures such as lightning

bugs. If I recall correctly, they produce their own light. ~~”~~ ~~_Who has seen_~~

~~_lightning bugs or fireflies in the summer time? (Show Image Card_~~

~~_What word part do you hear that is also in the word illuminate and_~~

~~_in Samuel Van Lumen’s name? (lumen) The root bio means life. So_~~

~~_bioluminescent means a living thing that produces its own light._~~


“Yes!” exclaimed Samuel, laughing as he spoke. “It seems that as my

eyes begin to fail me, I appreciate even more the things I am able to see.


“The science of light is really quite fascinating.”


“I’m sure it is,” shouted Jack. “However, I hope you’re not going to talk

all day. That’s why you never catch any fish, you know!”


**Show Image U5.L4.4:**
Alfie staring at his reflection


Samuel smiled at Jack and continued

to talk anyway. “You see, when light hits

a surface, some of the light bounces off

the surface. It is the light that bounces

off the surface that we call reflected light. Most objects reflect some

light. In fact, you are reflecting some light right now, Jack; otherwise, I

wouldn’t be able to see you,” explained Samuel. “Not that my eyes let

me see a whole lot these days!” he added.


Jack glanced over at Alfie, who was staring at his reflection in the still

water. Jack laughed and said, “Look at the way the smooth water is

reflecting a perfect image of Alfie—just like a mirror!”


At that moment, Jack stood up to check on his line. “Hmm, I thought

I sensed something nibbling, but there’s nothing there,” he said.

Lesson 4 Reflection and Mirrors
**65**


“When I was young,” Samuel mused, “I often wondered why we’re

able to see our reflection in some things but not in others.”


Jack laughed. “We wondered a lot of things when we were young.

I still wonder some of those things!”


**Show Image U5.L4.5:**
Jack and Samuel as kids in
Mr. Benson’s class


“Do you remember,” asked Samuel,

“when our third grade teacher, Mr.

Benson, brought a mirror and a piece

of wood into class to explain how light is reflected off a surface? He

showed us that when the surface of an object is perfectly smooth

and shiny, like that of a mirror, light rays hit all parts of the surface of

that object at the same angle. Therefore, light rays reflected by that

object bounce back off it at the same angle and produce a clear and

accurate reflection.”


Jack nodded, “I remember Mr. Benson well.”


“However,” Samuel continued, “when the surface of an object is not

perfectly smooth and shiny, like that of a piece of wood, light rays

hit different parts of it at different angles. Therefore, some light rays

are absorbed by that object, and some are reflected by that object at

different angles, so it does not produce a reflection.


**Show Image U5.L4.6:**
Alfie jumping off the pier; men laughing


“Mr. Benson was one of my favorite

teachers,” said Jack.


“Yep! He was one of my favorite

teachers, too,” agreed Samuel.


“I remember him explaining that because they are so smooth,

mirrors reflect almost all the light that hits them.”


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**66**


“Have you noticed that crazy dog of yours?” Jack asked. “He’s still

staring at his reflection in the smooth, shiny surface of the water.”


“He does that,” explained Samuel.


Both men laughed loudly. The sound of their laughter seemed to act as

a trigger for Alfie. He looked at them, wagged his tail, and then jumped

headlong into the river. ~~_What do you notice about how light behaves in_~~

~~_this image? (refecting off water, shadow under pier and under Alfe)_~~


“Don’t go too far out there, Alfie!” yelled Samuel, as if he was talking

to a young child.


The two men stood up to check their lines and then returned to their

chairs. Samuel continued to keep a watchful eye on Alfie, whose head

was just visible above the water. He noticed that the water was now

full of ripples, making the reflections in the water wavy and distorted.

~~_What does distorted mean? What clues helped you to understand that_~~

**Show Image U5.L4.7:**
Old mirror and new mirror


“I remember that day John O’Connor

brought a really old mirror into

class,” recalled Jack. “It was his

grandmother’s mirror, and we

couldn’t see ourselves that well in it. Mr. Benson compared it to a

modern mirror, the back of which was coated with a silvery material.

The modern mirror could reflect almost all the light that hit it.”


“Yes,” said Samuel, “and Mr. Benson told us that most mirrors have

flat surfaces and are called plane mirrors.” ~~_Show one of the small flat_~~

~~_mirrors and explain that it is called a plane mirror._~~


Lesson 4 Reflection and Mirrors
**67**


**Show Image U5.L4.8:**
Samuel’s face in spoons


“Mr. Benson also taught us about

two other types of mirrors that

have curved surfaces instead of

flat surfaces: concave and convex,”

recalled Samuel.


“Oh, I remember,” said Jack. “We had to draw two portraits of

ourselves: one portrait was a concave image, and the other was a

convex image. I remember that I borrowed my mother’s silver spoons

and brought them to school.”


“That’s right!” exclaimed Samuel excitedly. “That experiment was a

lot of fun!”


Jack went on, “Now let me see—concave and convex mirrors reflect light

in such a way that they alter, or change, the view we see in them. ~~_Show_~~

~~_the two sides of a large serving spoon as you read the following sentences._~~

~~_Then point to the left (concave) spoon in the image._~~


A concave mirror curves inward, and produces a smaller upside
down image of an object, but only if it is a certain distance away from

the viewer.”


“Yes,” added Samuel, “but if an object is very close to a concave

mirror, its reflection will be upright and magnified! Do you remember

how Mr. Benson showed us how you could put a pencil point right up

into the “cave” of the spoon and see it upright and magnified?”


~~_Demonstrate for students how you can hold a pencil point inside the_~~

~~_concave side of the spoon. Say, “Later you will have a chance to try this_~~

~~_activity on your own and you will be able to see the refection up close.”_~~


Jack nodded and continued. “Convex mirrors curve outward, and

always produce a smaller, upright image, as when you look into the

convex side of the spoon.” ~~_Point to the right spoon in the image._~~

~~_Explain that a convex mirror bulges outward and makes it easier to_~~

~~_see the surrounding area. Ask for examples of convex mirrors students_~~

~~_have seen. (on cars and buses, in stores.)_~~

Samuel laughed out loud. “Did you actually learn something in

school, Jack Audire? I seem to recall that you were always talking,

especially when Mr. Benson was talking!”


“Oh, I learned a thing or two,” protested Jack, “and I’ll have you know—”


Suddenly Jack leapt out of his chair. “Jumping jelly beans! I think I’ve

caught a fish!” he yelled.


**Show Image U5.L4.9:**
Jack struggling with fishing line


Almost at once Jack began to wrestle

with his fishing pole.


“It’s a big one, Samuel!” screeched

Jack as he struggled to hold onto his

fishing pole and not fall headfirst into the river.


“If you stand still, you’ll stand a better chance of reeling it in,”

advised Samuel.


“Stand still? Stand still?” shrieked Jack as he battled with the

creature on the end of the line. “This fish is the size of a whale! How

am I supposed to stand still?”

~~_Does Jack really think the fsh on the end of the line is as big as a whale?_~~

~~_Why does he use this expression? (He’s excited and he’s exaggerating.)_~~

~~_Let’s talk more about Samuel and Jack and their friendship. What do_~~

~~_you notice about them? (They like to do things together. They like to talk_~~

~~_about old times. They like to joke with each other.)_~~


For several minutes Jack appeared to do a dance on the end of the

pier with a fishing pole. Finally, Samuel had the good sense to take a

closer look at the creature that Jack was attempting to catch.


“Hold on a minute, Jack! Stop wrestling with that line. You’ve hooked

Alfie by the collar! The poor dog is trying to free himself, and you

keep trying to reel him in!” laughed Samuel.


“That darn dog should be banned from coming fishing with us! He’s

more trouble than he’s worth!” roared Jack.

“Hold on, hold on. Let me get my

a photograph of the day Jack Audire

hooked himself a live springer spaniel!”


Moments later, having been unhooked by Jack, an extremely wet

Alfie stood happily wagging his tail beside Jack, while Samuel busied

himself taking photographs of the two of them.


“Get away from me, you darn dog,” muttered Jack as Alfie shook

himself dry.


Samuel laughed aloud as he continued to capture photographic

images of his two best friends.


“If you don’t put that camera away right now, you’ll be as wet as that

silly dog!” announced Jack.


“Okay,” laughed Samuel. “Time for lunch, I think.”

The two friends shared some chicken

and coleslaw while Alfie lay in the sun

to finish drying off.


“I’m glad I had my camera with me,”

Samuel said between mouthfuls as he arranged the parts of his

camera on the picnic blanket. “Did you know that some cameras

contain plane mirrors that make it possible to see the image you are

about to photograph?” ~~_Explain that those types of cameras are older,_~~

~~_not like the digital cameras that most people use today._~~


“Yeah, well, you certainly didn’t need to record that image of me

hooking Alfie,” grumbled Jack, offering a piece of chicken to Alfie.

Samuel laughed as he began to pack up the picnic basket. “Well,

you’ve obviously forgiven him. Did I tell you that we are taking Amy to

the fair tomorrow?”


“We?” exclaimed Jack.


“Yep! That was the deal,” explained Samuel. “I told her that if she

made me some chocolate cake, I’d take her to the fair.”


“Me, too?” shouted Jack, a little less grumpily.


“You’re going to eat some cake, aren’t you?” Samuel yelled back.


“Well, okay then, but you’re not going to make me go on those

bumper cars again, are you?” asked Jack.


“No,” said Samuel with a smile. “This time I thought we would try the

House of Mirrors.”


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** You heard Samuel explain to Jack that when rays of light waves hit

an object, they can be transmitted, reflected, or absorbed. What do these

terms mean?


» When light hits an object and passes through it, it is transmitted; when light hits

an object and bounces back off it, it is reflected and creates a reflection; when

light hits an object and is soaked up into it, it is absorbed and a shadow is created

behind the object.


2. **Inferential.** What causes light to reflect off water, glass, and other smooth

and shiny objects?


» Rays of light waves hit all parts of smooth, shiny objects at the same angle and are

then reflected off them at the same angle, creating a clear reflection.

3. **Evaluative.** Based on the information in the story so far, why do you think

Samuel wants to visit the House of Mirrors?


» Samuel is interested in the extraordinary science of light and the important part it

plays in his art. He has already explained what causes light to reflect off smooth,

shiny surfaces. By visiting the House of Mirrors, he will be able to demonstrate to

Jack and the children the different ways that mirrors of various designs reflect light.

us about two other types of mirrors that have curved surfaces instead of flat
surfaces: _concave_ and _convex_ .”


3. Say the words _concave_ and _convex_ with me.


4. If you are looking at something _concave_, it is bent or curved inward. If you are
looking at something _convex_, it is rounded and curved outward.

~~**WHOLE GROUP READING: “MIRRORS AND REFLECTIONS” (30 MIN.)**~~


**Pages 28–29**

 - Read the title of the chapter, “Mirrors and Reflections”, together as a class.


 - Point students’ attention to the image on **page 29** and read the caption,

“Light reflected from the surface of this mirror allows the dentist to see the
back of this person’s teeth.”


 - Remind students that in previous lessons, they learned that light travels in
straight lines and is stopped by opaque objects, creating shadows.


 - Ask students to read **page 28** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “What happens when light hits a smooth, shiny surface?”


 - When most students have finished reading, restate the question and have
students answer.


» Light is reflected when it hits a mirror, which is a smooth, shiny surface.



Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**76**


When a **mirror** is made, glass is coated with hot,
**silvery** metals and then cooled. This coating makes
the **mirror** shiny so it **reflects** back all the light that
hits it.

Did you know that there are different types
of **mirrors** ? You probably use a **plane mirror**
every morning when you get ready for school. A
**plane mirror** has a more or less flat **surface** . The
**reflection** of something in a **plane mirror** is almost
the same size as the real object.


_This little girl is looking at her_ _**reflection**_ _in a_ _**plane mirror**_ _._

**Pages 30–31**

  - Draw students’ attention to the image on **page 31** . Say to students,
“I wonder what a mirror is made of. Let’s read **page 30** to find out more.”


  - Ask students to read **page 30** to themselves to fill in the blank in the
following sentence: “A mirror is made of .”


  - When students have finished reading, reread the sentence and ask students
to fill in the blank.


» glass coated with hot, silvery metals


  - Have students look back at the image on **page 31** and have them give
examples of the mirrors they may have in their homes.


» Answers may vary but could include a bathroom mirror, a mirror hanging on a

wall, a mirror on the back of a door, etc.


Lesson 4 Reflection and Mirrors
**77**


                 - Tell students that most mirrors found in homes are called plane mirrors. Ask,
“What are plane mirrors?”


» Ask one student to read the sentence(s) that answer(s) the question. A plane

mirror has a more or less flat surface. The reflection of something in a plane

mirror is almost the same size as the real object.


                  - Have students turn to Activity Page 4.2. Discuss the central idea of the text
(mirrors) and additional details. Have students record the information from
the text and discussion in the first web.


» The central idea is mirrors. The details should include: silvery metal, plane mirrors

are flat, same size reflections.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**78**


**Plane mirrors** are used in many tools. Cameras,
telescopes, and microscopes sometimes use **plane**
**mirrors** . Some toys even use **plane mirrors** . Have
you ever looked through a toy called a **kaleidoscope** ?
A **kaleidoscope** is a tube with **plane mirrors** inside.
There are also tiny bits of colored glass and beads
sealed up inside the **kaleidoscope** . You look through
a small hole at one end of the **kaleidoscope** and
point it toward the light. As you rotate the tube, you
will see beautiful, colored patterns.



_Here’s what the outside tube of a toy_ _**kaleidoscope**_ _looks like._


_Here’s what you might see if you looked inside a_ _**kaleidoscope**_ _._

**Pages 32–33**

  - Have students read **pages 32–33** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “What is a kaleidoscope?” Point to the word kaleidoscope. Ask the
students to use their knowledge of syllable patterns to decode the word.


» When most students have finished reading, restate the question and have

students answer. A kaleidoscope is a tube with plane mirrors, tiny bits of colored

glass, and beads, inside.


  - Ask, “How does a kaleidoscope work?”


» You look through a small hole at one end of the kaleidoscope, point it toward

the light, and rotate the tube. Beautiful patterns appear, as seen in the image on

**page 32** .


  - Show a brief video on how kaleidoscopes work (optional).


Lesson 4 Reflection and Mirrors
**79**


**Pages 34–35**

                       - Ask students to read just the first paragraph on **page 34** to themselves to
answer the question: “How are concave and convex mirrors different from
plane mirrors?”


                       - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have
students answer.


» Plane mirrors are flat, while concave and convex mirrors are curved.


                 - Ask, “Which way does a concave mirror curve?”


» inward like a spoon


**Note:** You may wish to tell students that _concave_ has the word cave in it.

A way to remember which kind of mirror curves inward and which curves

outward is that concave mirrors curve inward, like walking into a cave.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**80**


- Ask, “Which way does a convex mirror curve?”


» outward


- Next, have students read the second paragraph on **page 34** to themselves to

answer the question: “How is the reflection of objects in concave and convex
mirrors different from the reflection of objects in plane mirrors?”


- When students have finished reading the second paragraph, restate the

question and have a student answer.


» The reflection of objects in plane mirrors is about the same size as the object,

while the reflection of objects in concave and convex mirrors appears larger or

smaller than the real object.


- Direct students’ attention to the images and caption on **page 35** .


- Have students turn to Activity Page 4.2. Discuss the central idea of the text

(mirrors or special mirrors) and additional details. Have students record the
information from the text and discussion in the second web.


» The central idea is mirrors or special mirrors. The details should be the words

concave curves inward, and convex curves outward; objects can be reflected as

smaller or larger than their actual size.


- Have students independently complete the sentence “The central idea of

Lesson 4 Reflection and Mirrors
**83**


So now you see how useful **mirrors** are in our
everyday lives. **Mirrors** can also be a lot of fun.
A circus or carnival sometimes has a place called
the “Funhouse,” or “House of **Mirrors** .” If you go
in, there are lots of **concave** and **convex mirrors** .
When you look in these **mirrors**, you might not
recognize yourself! Your **reflection** is **distorted** .
What makes that happen? Now you know it’s
**concave** and **convex mirrors** .


_**Concave**_ _and_ _**convex**_ _**mirrors**_ _can_ _**distort**_ _the_ _**reflection**_ _of an object._

**Lesson 4: Reflection and Mirrors**

Language



25M



**Primary Focus:** Students will identify adverbs that tell _when_ and _where_ .


~~**TEKS 3.11.D.v**~~


~~**GRAMMAR: ADVERBS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Adverbs That Tell When and Where**

  - Draw students’ attention to the adverbs poster you displayed in advance.
Point out that the adverbs telling _how,_ all end in the suffix _–ly_ .


**Adverbs**


_Adverbs_ are words that can describe verbs.


    - They can tell _how_ the action of a verb happens.


    - They can tell _when_ the action of a verb happens. ( _yesterday, today,_

_tomorrow, always, sometimes, never, early, first, next, last, again, soon, later_ )


    - They can tell _where_ the action of a verb happens. ( _here, there, everywhere,_
_anywhere, inside, outside, somewhere_ )


  - Tell students that today, they will continue to work with adverbs. However,
the new adverbs do not end in _–ly_ and so may be more difficult for students
to identify.


  - Instead of telling _how_ the action of a verb takes place, the adverbs today
describe _when_ or _where_ the action of the verb takes place.


  - Read with students the adverbs that tell _when,_ listed on the poster.


  - Use several adverbs that tell _when,_ from the poster, in oral sentences. Ask

students which word in each sentence tells _when_ ; emphasize that this word
is the adverb. If students have difficulty, repeat each sentence and encourage
students to look at the words on the adverbs poster. For example:


    - Tom and Bob will play baseball tomorrow. (Which word tells when? _tomorrow_ )


    - I never eat chocolate. ( _never_ )


    - I fell asleep early. ( _early_ )


  - Display the “Adverbs That Tell When” sentences you prepared in advance.


  - Ask students to look at the list of _when_ adverbs on the poster and choose

one that would fit in the blank of the first sentence.


**TEKS 3.11.D.v** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including: adverbs that convey time and adverbs that convey
manner.


Lesson 4 Reflection and Mirrors
**85**


- For each adverb suggested by students, ask them to first say the complete

sentence using their selected adverb. If the word makes sense within the
context of the complete sentence, write it in the blank. (In some instances,
more than one adverb may make sense.) Remind students to use their best
cursive handwriting.


- Ask students which word in the sentence tells _when_ . Draw a triangle around
the adverb and then draw an arrow from it to the verb it describes.


- Follow these steps with the remaining _when_ sentences you prepared in
advance. Here is a key:

  - When did I play football with my friends?



»



_yesterday_




                        - When do I play football with my friends?

» _always_


                        - When did he do his hardest homework assignment?

» _first/next_


                        - When did he do his homework?

» _again/later_


Where?


                  - Tell students that other adverbs can tell _where._


                  - Point out the third bullet on the adverbs poster you displayed in advance.
Read the adverbs listed on the poster with students, emphasizing that all of
these words tell _where_ something is happening.


                  - Use several adverbs that tell _where,_ from the poster, in oral sentences. Ask
students which word in each sentence tells _where;_ emphasize that this word
is the adverb.


                 - Display the “Adverbs That Tell Where” sentences you prepared in advance.


                   - Ask students to look at the list of the _where_ adverbs on the poster and

choose adverbs that would fit in the blank of the first sentence.


                       - For each adverb suggested by students, ask them to first say the complete

sentence using their selected adverb. If the word makes sense within the
context of the complete sentence, write it in the blank. (In some instances,
more than one adverb may make sense.) Remind students to use their best
cursive handwriting.


                 - Ask students which word in the sentence tells _where_ . Draw a triangle around
the adverb and then draw an arrow from it to the verb it describes.


                 - Follow these steps with the remaining _where_ sentences you prepared in
advance. Here is a key:


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**86**


   - Where does Dad work?

» _inside_


   - Where are flowers growing?

» _everywhere/somewhere/there/here_


   - Where did I leave my book?

» _somewhere/there/here/inside/outside_


   - Where did Sam put the mail?

» _here/there/somewhere/inside_


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 4.3. Complete this as an
independent activity.


~~**SPELLING (10 MIN.)**~~


**Word Sort**

 - Tell students they will sort words with /ee/ spelled ‘y’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘ea’, ‘ee’, ‘ie’, ‘ey’,
and ‘e_e’. Remind students that they have read many words with the various
spelling patterns that make the /ee/ sound. Remind students that reading in
context helps them to decode the words, and learning to encode the words by
writing helps them to decode and read the words.


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 4.4. Model fluently reading the words in
the box at the bottom of the page.


 - Ask students to identify the vowel patterns. (‘y’ > /ee/, ‘e’ > /ee/, ‘i’ > /ee/,

‘ea’ > /ee/, ‘ee’ > /ee/, ‘ie’ > /ee/, ‘ey’ > /ee/, and ‘e_e’ > /ee/)


 - Have students independently read the words in the box below the headers
and circle the vowels that have the /ee/ sound.


 - Then, have students independently write the words that match the various
spellings below the appropriate headers. Remind students they should write
the matching words in cursive. Model cursive writing by writing 1-2 words
from the box with the students. Provide feedback and guidance as needed.

» Responses may include that the straw looks magnified, bent, or separated at the

water line.


                  - Share with students that certain substances have the ability to bend light and
distort the image that we see. Ask students if they’ve seen examples of this.


» Responses may include aquariums or swimming pools.


                  - Set the purpose for listening by telling students to listen for ways that light
can bend and also for examples of tools and instruments that bend light in
interesting and useful ways.

Samuel walking in the woods with Alfie


The next day Samuel was up bright

and early. He had begun the day by

painting in the garden, but as his

eyes grew tired, he decided to put

down his paintbrush and go for a

walk in the woods with Alfie. Samuel loved to observe the perfectly

straight shafts of light as they burst through the tree canopy into the

woodland.

Children walking toward their
grandfather


Later, when they had returned from

their walk, Samuel passed several

hours scrapbooking photographs of

his grandchildren. Before he knew it, it was late in the afternoon.


“Grandad! Grandad! We’re here!” came the sound of two young voices.


Two smiling children walked toward Samuel as he sat in his favorite

armchair. One of the children was a girl about eleven years of age.

She was tall and skinny and had braided brown hair. Her face was

awash with freckles. She was carrying a large chocolate cake. The

other child was a boy about eight years old. He, too, had brown

hair, and he wore a bright red T-shirt that said “Save Trees. Avoid

Homework.” It was obvious that they were brother and sister. They

were two of Samuel’s four grandchildren.


“Mom walked us to the garden gate. She says she’ll stop by later for

dinner, after we’ve been to the fair. She’s going to bring us a meatloaf

that she made,” said the girl, whose name was Amy.


Samuel grimaced.


“Mom says she knows you don’t like meatloaf, but you have to eat

it anyway because it’s good for you!” said the boy who was clearly

missing his two front teeth.


“Oh, she does, does she?” replied Samuel.


“Yep!” said the boy.


“How come you’re here?” said Samuel laughing. “Did you make that

chocolate cake?”


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**94**


The boy, whose name was Ethan, smiled boldly. “I didn’t make it, but

I was the one who said it should be a double chocolate cake, and not

just chocolate,” explained Ethan.


“Oh, well, I guess that’s a good enough reason for you to come to

the fair with Amy and me,” said Samuel, teasing his grandson.” Let’s

go put the cake in the kitchen!” ~~_Who are the two new characters?_~~

Samuel and children at
kitchen table


In the kitchen Samuel poured two

glasses of ice cold water and placed

a striped straw in each glass. “Have a

cold drink before we go,” Samuel instructed.


Moments later they heard the sound of a very loud voice.


“Samuel!” yelled Jack. “You need to do something about that dog.


He’s run off with my hat again!”


Samuel and the children burst out laughing.


At that moment Jack appeared in the kitchen looking a little

flustered. “Why, if it isn’t my two favorite children!” Jack exclaimed.


**Show Image U5.L5.4:**
Observing straw in glass


Samuel poured two more glasses of

water and joined his guests at the

kitchen table. All four sat and chatted

and sipped their drinks.

“Grandpa,” said Ethan, “Why does it look like the straw is separated

where it meets the water? See, the part of the straw in the water is

magnified and looks like it’s bent!”


“That’s a really good question, Ethan,” replied Samuel eagerly. “Well,

where should I begin?”


“This could take a while,” warned Jack, smiling the tiniest bit.

about how light travels


**Show Image U5.L5.5:**
Transparent, translucent, and
opaque objects


“You may have learned by now that

light can be transmitted, or passed

through some objects, but not others,”

began Samuel. “Objects that most light can pass through, such as

eyeglasses or an empty glass, are called transparent, and objects

that light cannot pass through, such as a tackle box or Jack’s hat, are

called opaque.”


“My hat’s been called worse!” Jack shouted.


Amy and Ethan giggled.


“What about objects that some light can go through, like frosted

glass and tracing paper?” asked Amy. “I think there’s a name for

those, too.”


“Yes,” said Samuel, “Those objects are called translucent. They let a

little bit of light pass through, and it scatters or spreads out, causing

the objects you see through them to look fuzzy.”


~~_Which substance is translucent, letting some of the light pass_~~

“Cool!” exclaimed Ethan. “We’re about to start learning all this stuff in

third grade.”


“Yeah, it is cool,” joined in Amy. “And now you’ll be a little

ahead, Ethan!”


“You may have also learned,” continued Samuel, “that when light

waves travel through different transparent substances, such as

through the air and then through a drinking glass, or through a glass

and then through the water, they change speed,” explained Samuel.


Amy nodded. “I remember learning that when a light wave suddenly

changes speed, it quickly changes its direction and looks like it’s

bending. That’s why when you look into a river and see fish, they

seem closer to the surface than they actually are.”


“Does that apply to dogs, too?” yelled Jack, remembering

catching Alfie.


The children looked at Jack with puzzled expressions.


“Oh, it’s a long story,” said Samuel, laughing.


“To return to your question, Ethan, that’s exactly why a straw

standing in a glass of water appears to bend or even break apart as

it enters the water. This sudden change of speed and direction of the

light wave is called refraction.”


“Refraction?” repeated Ethan.


Samuel nodded and continued. “In fact, the refraction of light

is how a concave or convex lens works in many instruments, or

tools, that we use.” ~~_What words did you hear that may be new?_~~

Convex and Concave lenses


Samuel went on, “A convex lens

curves outward so that it is thicker in

the middle than at the edges. Rays of

light passing through a convex lens

are forced to change direction and move toward each other, making

things look bigger if they are close enough to the lens. Convex lenses

are used in instruments such as microscopes, magnifying glasses,

binoculars, telescopes, and cameras.”


The lenses in my eyeglasses are convex to help me see close images

better when I’m painting.”

Samuel continued, “On the other hand, a concave lens curves inward

like a cave and is thinner in the middle than at the edges. Light rays

passing through a concave lens are forced to change direction and

move away from each other, making things look smaller. Cameras use

lenses to focus the light rays inside the camera to record an image.

Lenses are also used in security cameras and peepholes

that are in some doors to help the background view look wider and

easier to see.”


“I don’t want to interrupt your lecturing, Samuel, but I’ve heard it’s

going to be busy at the fair tonight, so we should get going,” said Jack

as he finished his drink.


“Good point, Jack. We’d better get ourselves out of here.”

“Yay!” yelled Ethan excitedly. “I want us all to go on the

chair-o-planes!”


“We’ll have to see about that,” replied Jack. “I need to be able to walk

home from the fair in one piece, not a million, zillion pieces!”


The two children laughed at Jack, and then Ethan ran off to rescue

Jack’s hat from Alfie.

Fifteen minutes later, having arrived

at the fair, they promptly bought a roll

of tickets for various rides, as well as

four helpings of cotton candy. They

stood together for a short time, eating the sweet cotton candy and

observing all the fun of the fair.


Finally, Amy asked, “What should we do first?”


“I have a special request,” said Samuel. “I have been teaching

Jack about the science of light. I have promised him a trip to the

House of Mirrors.”


“It was more like a threat,” retorted Jack.


The two children laughed at Jack’s grumpy reply.


“The House of Mirrors is so much fun!” exclaimed Amy.


“Let’s go!” cried Ethan, as he grabbed his grandfather’s hand. And with

that, the four of them made their way toward the giant red, white, and

Everyone standing in front of distortion
mirrors


A man dressed like a clown stood

at the entrance. He smiled and took

their tickets. Upon entering the

partly wooden, partly tented structure, they discovered an array, or

selection, of distortion mirrors. As they stood in front of each mirror,

they witnessed a variety of optical illusions.


“I have a head shaped like a giant melon,” pronounced Jack.


“This is so cool,” said Ethan eagerly, looking into the mirror that had

convex and concave parts. “Look, I’m really tall and skinny.”


“I’m short and really, really wide,” exclaimed Amy, looking at her

reflection in the mirror.


“How is this possible?” asked Ethan, as he observed his new shape.


“Well,” began Samuel, “I’m glad you asked that question, Ethan.”


“Oh no, I sense another speech,” said Jack. And with that, Jack

walked toward the entrance to the mirrored maze.


“You’re going to miss my talk,” said Samuel as he watched Jack

walk away.


“That’s fine with me,” Jack replied.


“Actually it’s a very simple concept,” explained Samuel, ignoring

Jack’s comment. “Mirrors are made of reflective material. Each one

of these mirrors has a different shape. Depending on the shape of

the mirror, it can be used to bring light rays together, or spread them

apart. Some of these mirrors have concave and convex parts, some

are slightly twisted, and some are even folded.” Samuel continued,

“Generally, convex mirrors make images look smaller, whereas

concave mirrors can make images look larger. When you put them

together, you get some really funny shapes!”


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**100**


“So, different mirrors do different things,” said Ethan, who had been

listening intently to his grandfather.


“Yes! For example,” continued Samuel, “a convex mirror, like the ones

on the sides of your school bus, curve outward so that rays of light

striking them are forced to change direction and move away from

each other, making distant things look smaller and the background

wider. This allows the bus driver to see more area around the bus.

Objects very close to these mirrors may look wider and distorted.”


“Cool,” exclaimed Ethan.


“It is cool,” Samuel agreed. “In comparison, a concave mirror—like

the large makeup mirror your mother has or the shaving mirror your

father has—curves inward so that light rays hitting it are forced to

change direction and move toward each other, making things look

larger,” explained Samuel.


“I get it! I get it!” exclaimed Amy happily. “When light strikes either

a concave or a convex mirror, it is reflected in different ways at

different angles.”


“Right on the button!” said Samuel. “Light reflects differently in each

mirror in such a way that it alters the view. The waves of light provide

a clear, but altered, image.”

“Well, you did go wandering off!” yelled back Samuel. “Hold on! Hold

on! We’re on our way.”


Samuel and his grandchildren made their way toward the entrance to the

mirrored maze. The maze was a series of narrow, mirrored corridors.


The trick was to find an opening into a new corridor, and if you

followed the path correctly, you would eventually find your way

out. However, because the walls were made entirely out of framed

mirrors, it was difficult to find the openings, and people had been

known to walk round and round for a very long time.


Eventually Samuel, Amy, and Ethan found Jack. They basically

followed the sound of his very loud complaints. Once they were all

together, they put Ethan in charge of finding the way out. It didn’t

take him long to figure out the way to the exit.

Finally, it was time to go. Samuel had promised his daughter Anna

that the children would be home in time for dinner.


“Time to go, children,” said Samuel softly.


“Oh, grandad!” exclaimed Ethan. “We haven’t been on the chair-o

**Refraction and**



**Lenses**



In the previous chapters, you have been reading
about how light travels. You already know that light
travels at a very fast speed—faster than any machine
made by humans.

You also know that light travels in a straight line,
unless it runs into something in its way.

_When light hits a_
_transparent object, it_
_passes right through_
_the object._


_When light hits an_

~~**WHOLE GROUP READING: “REFRACTION AND LENSES” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Pages 40–41**

  - Read the title of the chapter together as a class, “Refraction and Lenses.”


  - Ask students to read **page 40** to themselves to review what happens to light
when it encounters different types of objects along its path.


  - Next, draw students’ attention to the images on **page 41** and read the

captions together. Model appropriate fluency, rate, and prosody while
reading the captions. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


  - When students have finished reading, ask different students to explain what
happens when light hits a transparent, opaque, or shiny object. Encourage
students to use the unit vocabulary that they have been learning in their
response, e.g., _absorb, shadow, reflect,_ etc.


» When light hits a transparent object, it passes right through the object. When light

hits an opaque object, the light is absorbed and blocked so a shadow is made.

When light hits a shiny object, it is reflected.


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound


One of the things we haven’t studied yet is
what happens to the speed of light when it passes
through something transparent. As fast as light
is, when it passes through something transparent,
it does slow down. So, when light passes through
windows, water, and even air, it slows down. The
**denser** or heavier something is, the slower light
travels through it. For example, light travels more
slowly through glass than it does through water or
air. It travels more slowly through water than it does
through air.


_Does light travel fastest through glass, water, or air?_


42 43


**Pages 42–43**

  - Have students read **page 42** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “Does light always travel at the same speed?”


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have
students answer.


» No, light slows down when it goes through transparent objects that are dense

or heavy.


  - Ask, “Which is denser or heavier, a piece of glass or water?”


» glass


  - Ask, “Through which of these two transparent materials, glass or water, will

light travel faster?”


» water


Lesson 5 Refraction and Lenses, Part 1
**107**


                - Ask, “Why?”


» Water is a liquid and is less dense than the glass, which is a solid.


                  - Ask, “Which is heavier or denser, water or air?”


» water


                  - Ask, “Through which of these two transparent materials, water or air, will

light travel faster?”


» air


                - Ask, “Why?”


» Air is a gas and is less dense than water, which is a liquid.

  - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 45** . Read the caption
together as a class or have a student read it to the class.


  - Say to students, “I wonder why the straw looks bent. Let’s read **page 44** to
find out more.”


  - Ask students to read **page 44** to themselves to find out more about why the
straw looks bent.


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have
students answer.


» When light moves from one thing that is transparent to something different, that

is also transparent, it changes speed. When light changes speed, the angle of the

light rays change and appear to bend, making the straw appear to bend.


Lesson 5 Refraction and Lenses, Part 1
**109**


                 - Ask, “How does the speed of light moving from air to water cause the straw
to look bent?”


» Light slows down as it moves from air to water. As the light enters the water, it

changes angle direction because it slows down.

**Pages 48–49**

                 - Ask students to read **page 48** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “How do convex lenses change the way things look?”


                      - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have

students answer.


» When you look through a convex lens, an object will look larger and closer. It looks

magnified because the light rays are closer together.


                 - Ask, “How does a concave lens change the way things look?”


» A concave lens refracts and spreads light rays apart. If you look through a concave

lens, an object will look smaller.

A **magnifying glass** is an example of a simple
convex **lens** . If you hold and look at something
closely through a magnifying glass, it will look
larger. People use a **magnifying glass** to more
clearly see the details of something small.


_A_ _**magnifying glass**_ _has a convex_ _**lens**_ _that makes small details appear larger_

Concave **lenses** are also useful. Remember that
concave lenses spread out light rays. Concave **lenses**
are used in flashlights to increase the amount of
light they put out.

Do you wear eyeglasses at school or at home? If
so, you may have a concave **lens** . When people have
a hard time seeing things that are far away, they are
considered nearsighted. Concave **lenses** are used
to correct nearsightedness by spreading light rays
before they make it to the eye’s lens. This helps the
light hit the correct part of the eye, creating a clear
image for the brain.

~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 5, Lesson 5**

  - Students are likely to make the following errors


    - For ‘y’, students may write ‘ey’ or ‘i’


    - For ‘e’, students may write ‘ee’, ‘ea’, or ‘ie’


    - For ‘ea’, students may write ‘ee’


    - For ‘ee’, students may write ‘ea’


    - For ‘ey’, students may write ‘y’


    - For ‘e_e’, students may write ‘ee’ or ‘ea’


  - While any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still

be aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find
it helpful to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the
analysis chart. For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning
consonants?


  - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


  - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization and
punctuation.


  - Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

One of the things we haven’t studied yet is
what happens to the speed of light when it passes
through something transparent. As fast as light
is, when it passes through something transparent,
it does slow down. So, when light passes through
windows, water, and even air, it slows down. The
**denser** or heavier something is, the slower light
travels through it. For example, light travels more
slowly through glass than it does through water or
air. It travels more slowly through water than it does
through air.


_Does light travel fastest through glass, water, or air?_

Concave **lenses** are also useful. Remember that
concave lenses spread out light rays. Concave **lenses**
are used in flashlights to increase the amount of
light they put out.

Do you wear eyeglasses at school or at home? If
so, you may have a concave **lens** . When people have
a hard time seeing things that are far away, they are
considered nearsighted. Concave **lenses** are used
to correct nearsightedness by spreading light rays
before they make it to the eye’s lens. This helps the
light hit the correct part of the eye, creating a clear
image for the brain.

~~**WORD WORK: OPAQUE, TRANSLUCENT, AND TRANSPARENT (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the words _opaque_, _translucent_, and _transparent_ on the board in cursive
and provide an opportunity for students to apply decoding skills prior to the
words being discussed. Review syllable division patterns at this time as well.


2. In the Read-Aloud and the reading you heard, “Objects that most light can
pass through, such as eyeglasses or a window, are called _transparent_ ; objects
that let a little bit of light pass through, such as some liquids or stained glass,
are called _translucent_ . Objects that light cannot pass through, such as a
tackle box or Jack’s hat, are called _opaque._ ”


3. Say the words _opaque, translucent_, and _transparent_ with me. Write the words
_opaque_, _translucent_, and _transparent_ on the board or where all students can
see. Ask students the meaning of each word. If students do not know the
words, have students use a dictionary to determine the meaning of each
word. Use syllable patterns to decode each word.


4. If something is opaque, it prevents light from shining through, which makes it
impossible to see through it. If something is translucent, it lets some light pass
through, which makes a blurry image. If something is transparent, it allows
most light to shine through, making it possible to see a clear image through it.


5. Mark could not see anything through the opaque magazine, but he could see
many things through the transparent window; he could also see blurry trees
and light through the thin, translucent curtains.


6. Have you ever seen something that was opaque, something that was
translucent, or something that was transparent? What were they? Be sure to
use the words _opaque, translucent_, and _transparent_ when you describe them.


 - Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’
responses to make complete sentences: “I saw an opaque ” or
“The was translucent” or “ was transparent because .”


7. What are the words we’ve been talking about? What part of speech are the
words _opaque_, _translucent_, and _transparent_ ? (adjective)


 - Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up. Tell students that the words
_opaque_ and _transparent_ are antonyms because they have opposite
meanings. _Translucent_ has a meaning in between _opaque_ and _transparent_ .
Directions: Say, “I am going to name several things. If the object I name is
opaque, say, ‘That is opaque.’ If the object I name is translucent, say, ‘That is
translucent.’ If the object I name is transparent, say, ‘That is transparent.’”

~~**SPELLING (30 MIN.)**~~


                  - Tell students that this week they will review spellings of /æ/.


                  - As you introduce each of the spelling words, write it on the board in cursive,
pronouncing it as you write it. Model cursive writing using appropriate
spacing and sizing.


                  - Go back through the list of words, having students read the words and tell
you which vowels to circle for the sound /æ/.

  - Tell students that the Content Word, _straight_, does not follow the spelling

patterns for this week, though the ‘aigh’ is pronounced /æ/. _Straight_ is a
content-related word defined as “without a bend or a curve” and describes
light moving in straight lines.


  - Refer to the previously prepared table or display Digital Projection

  - Ask students to refer to the spelling alternatives for /æ/ on the Individual
Code Chart page 3. Point out that there are many spellings for /æ/ and ask
students to name the different letters used to represent the word.


  - Ask students to tell you which words to list under the ‘ay’ > /æ/ header, the

‘ai’ > /æ/ header, and the ‘ea’ > /æ/ header. Briefly explain the meaning of
each word.

  - Ask students to look at the Individual Code Chart for all of the different
spellings for /æ/.


Lesson 6 Refraction and Lenses, Part 2
**137**


                  - Ask students, “Of the seven spellings, which is used most frequently?” (‘a’)
Remind students to look at the power bar under the spellings and the order
in which they are sequenced to determine frequency.


                  - Ask students to locate the three spellings for /æ/ in this week’s spelling
words and determine whether they are frequently used spellings or not.


                 - Practice the words as follows during the remaining time: Call on a student
to read any word on the chart. Then have the student orally use the word in
a meaningful sentence. After the student says the sentence, have them ask
the class: “Does that sentence make sense?” If the class says yes, then the
student puts a check mark in front of the word and calls on another student
to come to the front and take a turn. If the class says no, have the student try
again or call on another student to come to the front and use the word in a
meaningful sentence. This continues until all the words are used or time has
run out.


**Note:** Have students read the decodable passage, “All About Refraction,”
that you prepared in advance to practice decoding words with /ae/ spelled
‘ay’, ‘ai’, and ‘ea’.


                 - Remind students that encoding, or breaking their spelling words down into
their seperate parts, helps them learn to see and remember those parts so
when they decode, or read new words, they know what sounds those spelling
parts make.

students to define these words and how they apply to the images.


 - Tell students they might see words with two suffixes, – _ous_ and – _ly_ .


   - Write the word spacious on the board or where students can see. My root

word is space. When I add suffix – _ous_ to the end of the word, it is now
spacious, meaning full of space. Can you look at the images in the readaloud and find something spacious?


   - You might also see words with suffix – _ly_ . Write hopefully on the board or
where all students can see. Ask students to turn to page 56 and find the
word hopefully. Ask a student to read the sentence. Suffix – _ly_ means “in a
way that is.” Ask students the meaning of hopefully.


 - Tell students that later in the lesson they will be conducting experiments, but
right now they are conducting research and recording information in their
Activity Page 7.1 Lab Notes like real scientists do. The notes they take will help
them make predictions and understand the results from their experiments.


 - As students read silently, circulate around the room, giving assistance if needed.

Lesson 7 What is Color?
**145**


Do you remember what you learned about
refraction? What happens to light when it passes
through something transparent like glass? The light
slows down and changes its path. A **prism** has a
special shape that refracts white light into all of the
colors of the rainbow.

Have you ever seen a rainbow in the sky when
the sun comes out after it rains? Raindrops in the
sky refract the light, just like a **prism** . This is what
creates the rainbow.


_A rainbow occurs when raindrops refract sunlight into all of the colors of_
_visible light._


58 59


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**146**


When white light is refracted, it often separates
into a combination of colors called the **spectrum** .
The colors in the **spectrum** always appear in the
same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, **indigo**,
and violet. These colors are part of the visible light
**spectrum** . They are the light waves that humans
can see. The colors of visible light are a result
of differences in wavelength. Red light has long
wavelengths and violet light has short wavelengths.

You can remember the names of the colors in
the visible light **spectrum** in the right order if you
can remember this funny name: “Roy G. Biv.” Each
letter in that name stands for a color in the rainbow.
Say it out loud. Try to remember it!


_You can remember the order of the colors in the visible light You can remember the order of the colors in the visible light_ _**spectrumspectrum**_ _if you if you_
_remember “Roy G. Biv.”remember “Roy G. Biv.”_


60 61


Lesson 7 What is Color?
**147**


Did you know that the color of any object
depends on what light wavelengths it reflects?
Different objects absorb light wavelengths of some
colors, but reflect others. This is what creates color.

Blue jeans appear blue because something in the
**material** reflects blue light and absorbs all of the
other light colors. Do you see anyone in your class
today wearing a red sweater? The sweater appears
red because something in the **material** reflects red
light and absorbs all of the other light.

What about things that appear to be white?
They look white because the object reflects all of
the white light wavelengths and doesn’t absorb any
light. Can you guess why something looks black?
Things that appear black do not reflect any light.
They absorb all of the light wavelengths.


_Can you explain why each thing appears to be the color it is?_

Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound



**148**


Remember that the colors we see are from light
of specific wavelengths. But, there is much more to
light than just the wavelengths we can see. In fact,
visible light is only a small part of the energy waves
that come from sunlight.

For example, on the shorter wavelength end of
the light **spectrum**, there are invisible **ultraviolet**
light waves that cause sunburn. X-rays are even
shorter wavelengths of light. We can’t see these
light x-rays but they can travel through the human
body. You learned in _How Does Your Body Work?_ that
x-rays are used to create black and white photos of
what’s inside the body. Do you know of any other
ways that x-rays are used?


_We can’t see x-ray wavelengths but these light waves can pass through your_
_hand and create an image of your bones on special x-ray film._


64 65


Lesson 7 What is Color?
**149**


Another type of invisible light is **infrared** waves.
The wavelengths of **infrared** light are longer than
those of red light. These are the type of light waves
that you use when you click on the **remote control**
to change television channels!


_Certain wavelengths of light are invisible. We can’t see the_ _**infrared**_ _light_
_from a_ _**remote control**_ _but we can see its effect when a channel is changed._

~~**EXPERIMENT 1 (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.7.E**~~


  - The teacher will conduct Experiment 1 while the students observe and
take notes.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 7.2. Explain that you will be doing the first
experiment and that they will be conducting the second experiment as a team.


  - Put the large container of water in front of the projector or a strong flashlight.


  - Tape the cardboard to the flashlight or projector so that only a small hole of
light shines through.


  - Explain to students that you are about to shine the light through the container
of water so that it shines on the second piece of cardboard that you will be
holding up behind the container. Ask students to write down their prediction
about what they think will happen in the first box on Activity Page 7.2.


  - Shine the light through the small hole in the cardboard and toward the
water while you or a student holds up the second piece of cardboard with
the larger hole near the water. A rainbow should appear on the second piece
of cardboard.


  - Have students write down their observations in the second box under their
prediction and then draw a picture of what the result of the experiment
looked like in the third box.


  - Have a few students share their observations.


~~**EXPERIMENT 2 (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Divide students into pairs. Make sure that each pair has a prism, a sheet of

white paper, and access to either sunlight or a strong flashlight.


  - Have students write their predictions for what they think will happen in the

first box under Experiment 2 on Activity Page 7.2.


  - Allow students to perform the experiment in pairs for several minutes and
then record their observations and draw a picture in the remaining boxes.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Who were the two new characters we met in the last Read-Aloud about the

trip to the fair?


» Ethan and Amy, Samuel’s grandchildren


2. What happened in the story?


3. What did Ethan and Amy see at the fair that had to do with reflection

and refraction?


 - Tell students that, to get warmed up for today’s story, you’ll ask them a series
of statements starting with “Raise your hand if . . ..” Tell students to raise their
hands if the statement is true about light.


   - Raise your hand if . . .


      - Light can travel through an opaque object like a book.


      - Light bends when it travels through a glass of water. (raise hands)


      - Eyeglass lenses are transparent. (raise hands)


      - A flat, bathroom mirror on the wall is a convex mirror.


      - A convex lens magnifies an object. (raise hands)


      - Light changes direction when it passes through a lens. (raise hands)


      - Light speeds up when it goes through certain objects.


      - You can always see a clear image when looking through a

translucent object.


      - A flat mirror on the wall is a plane mirror. (raise hands)


  - Show Image Card C.U5.L7.1 (Light Energy from the Sun).


 - Explain that it shows all types of light energy that are produced by the sun
and make their way through space to Earth. Tell students that some light
energy is visible to us and some of the light waves are invisible to us. The
visible light is what allows us to see the world as we do. Remind students that
they may already know about some invisible types of light energy, such as
X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves.


  - Show Image Card C.U5.L7.2 (Rainbow).

   - What do you see in this image?

   - Have you ever seen a rainbow?

   - Where did you see it?

   - What do these two images (Image Cards C.U5.L7.2 and C.U5.L7.1) have

in common?

may also keep a “unit dictionary” notebook along with definitions, sentences,
and/or other writing exercises using these vocabulary words.


**optometrist,** a doctor who examines people’s eyes to check if their vision
needs to be corrected in any way by wearing glasses or contact lenses, or by
medical treatment


**x-ray,** a powerful invisible ray of energy that can pass through an object and
make it possible to see inside of it; a picture that shows what makes up the
inside of something, such as the bones of the skeleton

~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD: “WHAT IS COLOR?” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U5.L7.1:**
Samuel at the stove


It was a sunny Saturday morning, and

Samuel had invited Amy, Ethan, and

Jack to breakfast. It had been three

days since Samuel had seen Jack and


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**154**


his grandchildren, because he had traveled to the city to a special

hospital to have his eyes checked by an optometrist.


~~_What do you think an optometrist is? Can you fgure it out from the text?_~~


Samuel set up two extra easels in the garden next to his easel. He was

trying to encourage his grandchildren to paint with him. He had long

since given up trying to get Jack to take up painting as a hobby. When he

was at the hospital, the optometrist had advised Samuel to rest his eyes,

but he found it difficult to give up his daily trip to the garden to paint.

Amy and Ethan arrived first. They really enjoyed having breakfast with

their grandfather. Samuel always served homemade pancakes, eggs,

sausages, bacon, and hash browns. The breakfasts were always amazing.


“Hey, Granddad!” yelled Ethan. “I’m starving. Is breakfast ready?”


“I doubt you are actually starving,” replied Samuel, “but it’s almost

ready. Just scrambling the eggs.”


Moments later Jack arrived, just in time to help Samuel serve the

breakfast feast.


~~_What is a synonym for the word feast?_~~


**Show Image U5.L7.2:**

Once the food had been served, Alfie

arrived in the kitchen with the hope of

getting a tasty morsel. Samuel

pretended to be strict about feeding Alfie from the table, but in truth

he liked to spoil him.


“You’ve outdone yourself,” said Jack appreciatively. He, too, enjoyed

Samuel’s famous breakfasts.


“What’s the plan for today?” asked Jack, hoping that there wouldn’t

actually be one.


Lesson 7 What is Color?
**155**


“Well, I’m going to make these two monkeys work a little,” said

Samuel grinning. “They are going to have a painting lesson, and all

three of you are going to have a lesson on the science of color.”


“That just means he’s going to talk a lot,” announced Jack.


The children laughed.


Samuel, Jack, and the children spent the next hour eating, talking, and

enjoying each other’s company. Ethan secretly reached down under the

table and fed Alfie small pieces of sausage, though Samuel was perfectly

aware of what he was doing. Then, after loading the dishwasher and

tidying up the kitchen, they made their way out into the garden.

~~_Tell students to listen carefully for_~~

~~_adjectives and adverbs that make the_~~

Samuel had set the easels up under

the shade of the large apple tree.


Once everyone was settled, including Alfie, he advised the children to

pick a subject to paint—something they could clearly see and would

enjoy painting.


“I’d like to paint the bird feeder,” pronounced Ethan.


“I think I’ll paint that potted geranium,” said Amy, pointing to a plant

with vivid red petals sitting snugly in a terra-cotta pot.


“I’ve chosen to sit here and close my eyes,” said Jack and then

promptly did just that.

“Light Energy from the Sun” Graphic


“The first thing I want you to

understand, and I’ve already explained

this to Jack, is that waves of light

energy race through space from the

sun to Earth,” Samuel began. “Each type of light energy has its own

unique wavelength.”


  - Picture Pause: Point to the tops of the two waves in the graphic.


  - Tell students, “A wavelength is the distance between two crests, or tops, of
the two waves. Some waves are longer than others.”


  - Point to the microwave and x-ray parts of the graphic.


Who can tell me which type of invisible light has a longer wavelength, the microwave
or the x-ray?


» microwave


“We cannot see all of the sun’s light energy, but the energy we can

see is called visible light. White light is made up of a spectrum of all

the colors we see in visible light.


~~_A spectrum is a series or range of objects, things, or ideas arranged in_~~

~~_a particular order._~~


~~_Tell students they’ll be talking more about the word spectrum during_~~

~~_Word Work._~~


~~_Point to the visible light._~~


~~_This range of wavelengths—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,_~~

~~_and violet—is visible to humans without using any special equipment._~~


~~_Do these colors remind you of something? (a rainbow)_~~


“Some light is invisible, such as x-rays,” continued Samuel.

“That’s complicated,” chimed in Ethan.


“Not really,” said Samuel.


“I agree with him,” said Jack, opening one eye and pointing at Ethan.


“Let me finish explaining, and it might make more sense,” continued

Samuel. “We need light to be able to see. Light from the sun travels to

Earth. Most of it is invisible to us unless we have equipment like x-ray

machines. The visible light shines on objects in the world around us.

Some of the light reflects off objects and into our eyes. Then, parts of

our eyes receive that information and communicate with our brain.

The brain figures out what colors we are seeing. However, and this is

what is really interesting,” said Samuel eagerly, “the color of an object

is determined by whether that object transmits, reflects, or absorbs

light. Sometimes it is a combination.”


**Show Image U5.L7.5:**

“Oh, it’s so much easier to understand

now,” joked Jack.


~~_Show Image Card C.U5.L7.4 (Reflection_~~

~~_and Color). Point to the grass and the arrows as you read the_~~

~~_next paragraph._~~


“Think of it this way,” continued Samuel. “Look at the grass. It looks

green because it reflects green light waves, but it absorbs the other

wavelengths of visible light, meaning it absorbs all the other colors.”



Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**158**


“What does absorb mean?” asked Ethan with a puzzled look on

his face. He had by now finished sketching the bird feeder and was

dipping his paintbrush into some carefully mixed brown paint.


~~_Who remembers what absorbed means?_~~


“Absorbed light is the light that is soaked up by an object and is

therefore no longer visible. The color you see when you look at an

object is actually the reflected light. An object has no color if there is

no reflected light,” explained Samuel.


~~_Point to the child’s red shirt on Image Card C.U5.L7.4._~~ ~~_What_~~

~~_wavelength of light is reflected from the shirt? (red)_~~


~~_Who can explain why a blue balloon appears to be blue? (The balloon_~~

~~_is reflecting blue light waves.)_~~


~~_When you look at objects of different colors, like green grass or a red_~~

~~_shirt, or a blue balloon, what can you say about the other visible light_~~

~~_waves that hit the objects? (They are absorbed by the object)._~~


~~_Reread the paragraph if necessary._~~


“Oh, I get it,” said Amy, who by now was painting the terra-cotta pot.


“That’s why my art teacher said that black materials absorb all colors

of light and do not reflect any. So, in a way, black is not a true color; it

is more a lack of light.”


“That’s exactly right, Amy,” said Samuel. “White is the opposite of

that. An object that appears white to our eyes reflects all the colors of

the spectrum and absorbs none of them.”


“Is that why people say you should wear white clothes in the

summertime?” asked Ethan, who was concentrating hard on painting

the roof of the bird feeder.


“Exactly!” exclaimed Samuel. “White material reflects most of the

light that hits it and absorbs very little, so if you wear white clothing,

you tend to stay a little cooler.”



Support


Ask if the picture clues help
students to understand
what the word _terra-cotta_
means. Explain that terracotta is a type of pottery
that is brownish-red or
brownish-orange in color.

“Who would like some ice cream?” asked Jack loudly. He had grown

restless and wanted to do something fun.


“Yay! Ice cream!” screeched Ethan.


“Yes, please,” said Amy.


“Here’s an interesting question,” said Samuel. “Which would melt

faster—chocolate or vanilla ice cream?”


The children frowned thoughtfully.


“Chocolate!” called Ethan.


“And why is that?” asked Samuel.


“Because it’s a darker color and would absorb more light!” said Amy.


“Very good,” said Samuel.


“Do you have mint chocolate chip?” asked Ethan.


“That’s my favorite!” yelled Jack.


“Mine too,” agreed Ethan.


“Do you have strawberry ice cream?” asked Amy.


“I sure do,” said Samuel.

Everyone in kitchen having ice cream


Samuel didn’t need a reply. Jack and

the children were already walking

toward the kitchen door. They hadn’t

realized it, but they had been out

in the garden for quite some time, and in that time rain clouds had

gathered in the distance.


Moments later, Samuel, Jack, Amy, and Ethan were sitting at the

kitchen enjoying double scoops of ice cream. Amy and Ethan had

drizzled chocolate sauce on top of theirs. There was even a very small

scoop of strawberry ice cream for Alfie, even though Samuel knew he

really shouldn’t have any.


“What do you call a ghost’s mother and father?” asked Ethan as he

licked chocolate sauce from around his mouth.


“I don’t know. What do you call a ghost’s mother and father?”

repeated Jack.


“Transparents!” announced Ethan.


“Which one runs faster, hot or cold?” Ethan continued.


“Hot. Everyone can catch cold,” answered Amy.


“Ahhh! You’ve heard it,” said Ethan, sounding disappointed.


“Okay, how about this one?” said Amy. “Why is it so hot in a stadium

after a football game?”


Samuel, Jack, and Ethan thought for a while but could not come up

with a good enough answer.


“Okay, smarty pants, tell us the answer,” said Jack.


“Because all the fans have left,” said Amy, clearly delighted

with herself.

“Look at that,” said Samuel pointing

through the kitchen window.


“It’s a rainbow!” exclaimed Amy.

~~_words that are joined together to make a new word)_~~

~~_Why do you think those two words were put together to describe it?_~~

~~_(You see rainbows during or after rain, and they are shaped like a bow_~~

~~_shape or arc.)_~~


“Oh, no! He’s going to tell us how they are formed,” said Jack pointing

his spoon at Samuel.


“Well, as a matter of fact,” replied Samuel, “A rainbow is a perfect

spectrum of colors.” We see this spectrum when waves of white light

encounter millions of falling raindrops. Just like the glass of water

and the straw, Ethan, the light waves slow down and refract when

they come into contact with the transparent raindrops. Essentially,

beams of white light break apart into the colors of the rainbow. Each

transparent raindrop acts as a prism, perfectly splitting white light

into all of its colors,” explained Samuel.


“Oh, we used prisms in class!” shouted Ethan. “It was so cool. It was

like making your own rainbow.”


~~_Who knows what a prism is?_~~

~~_happens to visible light when it goes through a prism? (The light refracts_~~

Samuel, Jack, Amy, and Ethan continued

to chat and joke and enjoy each other’s

company. After a while, they returned to

the garden where

Samuel continued the painting lesson.

He advised the children to pay attention to the angles and qualities

of light and shade that hung in the air like soft, clear, transparent

wings. He talked to them about texture and tone. All the while, Jack

sat in his garden chair and napped. Morning turned to afternoon, and

afternoon to early evening, and no one wanted to leave the comfort

and shade of the beautiful garden—not even Alfie.

6. **Inferential.** Why does my shirt look ?


» The colored shirt absorbs all the colors of white light except the light.


7. **Inferential.** What causes an object to look black?


» Black is the absence of reflected light that occurs when all colors of the spectrum

are absorbed.


8. **Inferential.** Describe the spectrum of colors and how it is formed.


» The spectrum is all the colors of the rainbow. When the waves of white light

are refracted through in just the right way by something transparent, a band of

colors appears.


9. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share._ In a completely dark room, is it possible to

see colors? Why or why not?


» No, because there is no color without light.


~~**WORD WORK: SPECTRUM (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _spectrum_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity

for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed.
Review syllable division patterns at this time as well.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard, “A rainbow is a perfect spectrum of colors.”


3. Tell students that Image Card C.U5.L7.2 shows the spectrum of colors
that are produced when white light passes through the raindrops in the
atmosphere. Say the word _spectrum_ with me.


4. A spectrum is a series or range of objects, things, or ideas arranged in a
particular order.


5. Max could see the entire spectrum of colors after the light went through his
prism, and he noticed that the colors were in the same arrangement as the
rainbow he had seen in the sky after the thunderstorm.


6. Have you ever seen a spectrum of colors before? What was causing the
spectrum? Be sure to use the word _spectrum_ when you tell about it.


 - Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’

**Primary Focus:** Students will use the meaning of suffixes _–ous_ and _–ly_ to write

words and sentences. ~~**[ TEKS 3.3.C; TEKS 3.2.D]**~~


~~**MORPHOLOGY: SUFFIXES –OUS AND –LY (15 MIN.)**~~


**Introducing Suffixes –ous and –ly**

  - Remind students that suffixes are added to the end of a root word.


  - Tell students that the two suffixes they will study this week are _–ous_ and _–ly._


  - Write the suffixes on the board in cursive and point out that the suffix _–ous_ is
pronounced /us/, like the tricky spelling in _cousin_, and – _ly_ is pronounced /lee/.

**Adding Suffix –ous**

  - Explain to students that _–ous_ means “full of.”


  - Tell students that, in this part of the lesson, they will add the suffix – _ous_

to root words that are all nouns. When _–ous_ is added to a noun, the word
becomes an adjective.


  - Write the word _joy_ on the board in cursive. Briefly discuss the meaning of
the word and then use it in a sentence. (a feeling of great happiness; At the
celebration, everyone was filled with joy.)


**TEKS 3.3.C** Identify the meaning of and use words with affixes such as im- (into), non-, dis-, in- (not, non), pre-, -ness, -y, and -ful;
**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Lesson 7 What is Color?
**165**


                       - Add the suffix _–ous_ to _joy_ and have students read the suffix, read the new
word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word. (full of a feeling of
great happiness)


                       - Ask students to reference a dictionary for the definition and syllabication of
the root words if needed.


                 - Ask students to provide sentences using the word _joyous._ (Answers
may vary.)


                       - Ask students for synonyms of joyous. _(happy, cheerful, merry)_


                 - Continue in this manner for the remaining – _ous_ words, using the following
chart as a guide. Have students use a dictionary to determine syllabication
and meaning of any unknown words.


**Note:** You will not write the information in the shaded columns on the board,

as that information is intended for use during oral instruction.


                  - Point out for students that for the word _fame_, the “e” must first be dropped
before adding _–ous._ Also point that for _mystery_ and _fury_, “y” is changed to “I”
before adding _–ous._

**Adding Suffix –ly**

                  - Explain to students that _–ly_ means “in a way.”


                       - Tell students that they will now add the suffix _–ly_ to the words they
previously added _–ous_ to. When _–ly_ is added to an adjective, the word
becomes an adverb.


                  - Tell students that adverbs with _–ly_ describe verbs, specifically how a
verb happens. Remind students that they learned about these adverbs in
Grammar earlier in this unit.


                 - Write the word _dangerous_ on the board in cursive. Briefly discuss the meaning
of the word and then use it in a sentence. (full of the chance that something
bad will happen; The dangerous broken glass covered the parking space.)


                       - Add the suffix _–ly_ to dangerous and have students read the suffix, read
the new word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word. (in a
dangerous way)


                 - Ask students to provide sentences using the word _dangerously_ .


» Answers may vary.


                 - Continue in this manner for the remaining _–ly_ words, using the following
chart as a guide. Have students use a dictionary to determine syllabication
and meaning of any unknown words.


**Note:** You will not write the information in the shaded columns on the board,

as that information is intended for use during oral instruction.


                   - Point out to students that not all of the _–ous_ words they learned will have _–ly_
added to them.

**Comparing Sentences with Affixed Words**

                       - Direct students’ attention to the first sentence you prepared in advance:


                        - The boy is filled with joy.


                       - Ask students. “What is the boy filled with?” They should respond _joy_ . Ask
them for the part of speech (noun) and draw a circle around the word _joy_ .


                 - Then, display the next sentence:


                        - The boy sang with a joyous voice.


                       - Ask students what the boy sang with. (voice) Draw a circle around _voice_,
stating that it is a noun.


                       - Ask students, “What kind of voice did the boy use?” (joyous) Draw a box
around _joyous_ and then draw an arrow to _voice_, stating that joyous is an
adjective that describes the noun _voice_ .


                 - Now, display the next sentence:


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**168**


   - The boy joyously sang the song.


 - Ask students, “What did the boy do?” (sang) Draw a wiggly line under sang
and identify it as a verb.


 - Then ask students, “How did the boy sing?” (joyously). Draw a triangle around
_joyously,_ stating that it is an adverb. Remind students that adverbs ending in _–_
_ly_ describe verbs, telling how. Draw an arrow from _joyously_ to _sang_ .


 - Repeat the same process and demonstration with the second set
of sentences.


 - Complete Activity Pages 7.4–7.7 in the same manner in which you have
completed these worksheets in previous lessons. Remind students to
complete Activity Pages 7.4-7.7 in cursive. Model appropriate spacing and
sizing by completing the first two examples together. Provide guidance and
feedback as needed while circulating through the room.


 - Collect Activity Pages 7.4–7.7.


~~**SPELLING (10 MIN.)**~~


**Blank Busters**

 - Tell students that they will practice writing their spelling words in cursive for
the week.


 - Review the pronunciation of this week’s spelling words. Pronounce each word
and then have students repeat it back to you.


 - Tell students to turn to Activity Page 7.8. Note for students that some
sentences have two blanks.


 - Point out to students that the spelling words are listed in the box on the
worksheet and on the board. Students may also have to add an appropriate
suffix to have the sentence make sense: _–s, –es, –ing,_ or _–ier._


 - Ask students to read the statement in number 1 silently and fill in the blank.
When students have completed number 1, call on one student to read
number 1 aloud with the spelling word in the blank.


 - Ask students if anyone had a different answer. Discuss the correct answer to
be sure students understand why it is correct.


 - Discuss the proper spelling of the word in the blank, referencing the table
of this week’s spelling words. Have students compare their spelling with the
spelling in the table.


 - Have students complete the rest of the activity independently, using the
table of this week’s spelling words to check their work. Circulate through
the room and provide guidance and feedback on spelling and cursive writing
where needed.

**Grade 3 | Unit 5**

Pausing Point 1


Note to Teacher


This is approximately the halfway point of the _Light and Sound_ unit. Students
have studied the properties of light, the way light travels, how light can be
manipulated, the visible light spectrum and instruments that use light. It is
recommended that you pause here and spend a day reviewing, reinforcing, or
extending them the material taught so far.


You may do the activities in any order or combination, using the whole class
or small groups to meet the needs of the students.


~~**CORE CONTENT UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


                 - Identify the sun as Earth’s main source of light and name other light sources.


                  - Identify light as a form of energy that travels in waves.


                  - Explain why light is so important.


                 - Describe how light waves travel in different mediums.


                - Explain how shadows are formed.


                      - Explain how light is absorbed, reflected, or transmitted.


                 - Describe the three types of mirrors: plane, concave, and convex.


                - Compare and contrast the terms concave and convex.


                - Compare and contrast transparent, translucent, and opaque objects.


                 - Describe how mirrors and lenses are used in a variety of instruments.


                  - Explain how light is refracted.


                      - Explain that color is determined by how light is absorbed and reflected.


                 - Explain what causes a rainbow to occur.


                 - Identify the spectrum of colors that makes up white light.


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Image Card Review**

                - Materials: Image Cards


Hold the image cards you have used so far fanned out like a deck of cards.
Ask a student to choose a card, but not to show it to anyone else in the


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom!: Exploring Light and Sound
**172**


class. The student must then give a clue about the image she is holding. The
rest of the class will guess what the image is or what light concept is being
described. Proceed to the next card when the correct answer is given.


**Graffiti Wall**

  - Materials: Chart paper and markers


Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary such as _energy._ Have them
brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the words,
such as _physical power_, needed by living things to exist, not unlimited, etc.
Students will record their response in both words and pictures on the chart
paper. Have students do a gallery walk of other groups’ charts.


**Riddles**

  - Materials: Paper and pencils


Have students create and exchange riddles to review everything they’ve
learned about light so far. For example, “I am created when something or
someone blocks a light source. What am I?”


**Compare and Contrast**

  - Materials: Chart paper or whiteboard


Draw a Venn diagram on the chart paper or whiteboard. Tell students that
you are going to compare and contrast two things students have learned
about, related to light by asking how they are similar and how they are
different. Choose from the following list or create a pair of your own:


  - a lens and a prism


  - all light energy and white light


  - opaque and convex objects


  - reflection and refraction


Some students may do this activity on their own, or create a three-way Venn
diagram to compare and contrast three things, that is, opaque, translucent,
and transparent objects; a telescope, a microscope, and a magnifying
lens, etc.


**Design a Light Experiment**

  - Materials: Paper and Pencils


Have students design an experiment that they would like to do regarding
light. They will need to list the question they are going to investigate, the
materials they will need, and the procedure they will need to follow to


Pausing Point 1
**173**


conduct the experiment. They should also make predictions as to what they
think the results of the experiment will be.


**Class Book: Light and Sound**

                 - Materials: Drawing paper and drawing tools


Tell the class or group of students that they are going to create a class
book to help them remember what they have learned so far. Have students
brainstorm important information about the properties of light. Have each
student choose one idea to draw a picture of, and ask them to write a caption
for the picture. You may choose to add pages about the properties of sound
upon completion of the entire unit before binding the book.


**Creating a Sundial**

                  - Materials: Sturdy, straight stick; rocks or chalk; and watch or clock


Have students find a grassy place outside that gets the most direct sunlight
throughout the school day. Once the place is found, put the stick into the
ground so that it is vertical. Each hour of the school day, on the hour, place
a stone showing where the stick’s shadow falls across an imaginary arc
circling the stick. Once the sundial has been created, students may return to
examine the sundial on the following day. Ask students to observe how the
shadow moves throughout the day. Discuss how the sundial works and how
this instrument was used in the past to tell time. Have students discuss how
the sundial and clock are different and similar.


**Making and Using a Periscope**

                  - Materials: Two quart-size milk or juice cartons; two small mirrors; scissors;
and tape


Open the tops of two empty cartons. Then, either with tape or glue, connect
the cartons together. With scissors, cut out an opening on the back of the
box on top and an opening on the front of the box at the bottom. Cut out two
diagonal slots on one side of the box. Both slots should be parallel, with one
close to the top opening and the other close to the bottom opening. Next,
place a mirror into each of the slots. The mirrors should be able to reflect
what is seen through the top portion of the periscope and vice versa. Have
students examine the top and bottom of the periscope, and then have them
discuss what makes this instrument useful.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom!: Exploring Light and Sound
**174**


**Light Poetry**

  - Materials: Paper and pencil


Have students create an acrostic poem using the word _light_ . For example:


**L—lumens**


**I—illuminates**


**G—glowing**


**H—heat**


**T—telescope**


Students can also choose another word from the Light unit or write a
different type of poem.


**Writing Prompts**

  - Materials: Paper and pencil


Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


  - The most interesting thing I’ve learned thus far is because .


  - My favorite instrument that we have discussed so far is because .


  - A rainbow is formed by .


  - Light can be manipulated by .


  - My favorite translucent material is because .


  - The direction of a ray of light can change its path because .

**Independent Reading** ~~**[TEKS 3.5]**~~

  - Materials: Assortment of books about light or energy.


Have students read additional trade books about light in your classroom or
from the library. After reading, have the students write a book review that
includes the following:


  - The title and author.

**Primary Focus:** Students will discuss and answer comprehension and vocabulary

questions related to the Read-Aloud text about how sound waves are created and

how they travel. ~~**[ TEKS 3.1.A; TEKS 3.3.B; TEKS 3.7.C; TEKS 3.7.F]**~~


~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. What do you think sound is?


2. How do we perceive sound? What sensory organ is used?


3. How do you think light and sound are similar? How do you think they

are different?


4. Can you name different sources of sound? (Answers will vary but may

include some of the following: people, animals, televisions, computers, iPods,

radios, cell phones, telephones, cars, planes, motorbikes, machinery, musical

instruments, household appliances, thunder, rain, hail, ocean, waterfalls, etc.)


5. If an instrument is a type of tool used for a specific purpose, what is the

purpose of a musical instrument?


  - Show students Image Card C.U5.L8.1 (Tuning Fork) and, if possible, a real tuning

fork as well. Ask if any students have seen or used a tuning fork. Ask students
how they think the tuning fork might be used to create vibrations. If possible,
demonstrate the tuning fork. Share with students that a tuning fork is a useful
tool for singers and musicians because it can be used to obtain a specific musical
note.


  - Ask students which character in the story has hearing loss. Write “Jack Audire”
on chart paper, the chalkboard, or a whiteboard. Write the word _auditory_, which
means having to do with hearing or listening. Ask students which parts of
_auditory_ and _Audire_ are the same. Underline _aud_ in both words. Tell students
that _aud_ is a Latin root that means to hear. Ask students to list other words
that contain this root. They may suggest _auditorium_, _audio_, _auditory_, _audition_,
or others. Discuss how each word relates to hearing or listening.


  - Ask students, “If a person cannot hear well, what are some ways to help their
communication with others?” Allow students time to share; some may have
friends or family members who have hearing loss. Explain that there are

devices, or tools, called hearing aids that improve, or increase, the sound that
can be heard. People with hearing loss also use other cues to communicate
effectively—they can read lips and nonverbal gestures. Remind students
that if they are speaking to someone with hearing loss, it is helpful to speak
clearly and to look at them, so they can read your lips and see your facial
cues.


 - Tell students to listen carefully to find out the answer posed in the title of
the Read-Aloud, “What Is Sound?” and to listen for the kinds of sounds that
Samuel, Jack, Ethan, and Amy experience on their trip to New York City. Have
students also listen for ways that sound and light are similar and different.


~~**PREVIEWING THE VOCABULARY**~~


**Core Vocabulary**

 - The following are core vocabulary words used in this lesson. Preview the
words with the students before the lesson. Students are not expected to be
able to use these words immediately, but with repeated exposure throughout
the lessons they will acquire a good understanding of most of the words.
Students may also keep a “unit dictionary” notebook along with definitions,
sentences, and/or other writing exercises using these vocabulary words.


**cacophony,** a harsh, unpleasant noise


**medium,** a substance that light or sound can travel through, like a solid,
liquid, or gas


**sound,** vibrations that are produced and that travel through particles, and
are heard by our ears


**sound waves,** the form that sounds take when they travel through a
surrounding medium, such as air, liquid, or solid


**vibration,** rapid movement back and forth

have to drive a little faster than you

did on the way here!”


“Why all the rush?” asked Samuel. “We’ve got plenty of time.”


“I don’t want to miss the train!” urged Jack, reaching over to honk the

horn to signal the children to come outside.


Samuel and Jack were taking Amy and Ethan to New York City for

the day. They were going to park at the train station and take the

train into the city. The day would be filled with a boat tour around

Manhattan followed by a concert and dinner.


“They’re here!” called Ethan from the doorway. The children ran

excitedly toward the car, waving goodbye to Alfie and their mom

and dad.


Alfie barked excitedly in response.


“Alfie, behave yourself and don’t bark all day at squirrels!”

called Samuel.


“Ha!” laughed Jack, “His bark is worse than his bite.”


“You mean like yours?” quipped Samuel.


“Ha, ha,” said Jack dryly.

Train passing through the beautiful
countryside


They arrived and made their way to

the platform, where the train was

already waiting. The four travelers

boarded the train and went in search of four seats together. Moments

later, their train pulled out of the station.


“You see?” exclaimed Jack. “We just made it in time!”


Images of the leafy countryside and the sparkling Hudson River

flashed past. The children talked excitedly about the sights they would

see and the food they would eat in New York City. After a while they sat

back in their seats and admired the view. Samuel had brought his new

cane with him. And while his new glasses had improved his vision to

some extent, walking with a cane helped him to feel even more secure.


“Granddad,” said Ethan, “do you like the sound of the train? I really,

really like it. It makes me feel as if we are going on a real adventure.”


“We are going on a real adventure,” Samuel replied. “Did you know

that sound travels in sound waves just as light travels in light waves?”

Samuel asked.

Jack lecturing on the train


“Now hold on a minute,” yelled Jack.

“You are a wonderful painter, Samuel,

and you have taught us all you know

about light. You have explained to us

how it helps you create beautiful images. But I do declare, Samuel,

you are not going to lecture us about sound. If anyone is going to do

that, it should be me—Jack Audire!”

~~_Why might Jack know more about sound than Samuel? What do you_~~

~~_know about Jack? (Jack had studied music.) Point to Jack Audire’s_~~

~~_name on the board. What part of Jack’s name has to do with hearing?_~~


“I don’t think I’ve taught you everything I know about light,” retorted

Samuel, “but if you want to tell us some interesting facts about sound,

then please do. I would love to hear what you have to say. After all, you

are a talented musician and have spent your life dedicated to music.”


“Flattery will get you nowhere, Samuel Van Lumen!” yelled Jack,

continuing the conversation. “Did you know that our ears, the

receptors of sound, are usually self-cleaning?” said an animated Jack.

~~_What is flattery?_~~


“Oh, that’s just plain gross!” exclaimed Amy.


“Okay, well, how about this?” Jack continued. “Your ears don’t stop

working, even when you are asleep. Your brain shuts out noises. Well,

as much as it possibly can.”


“Jack, is that really true?” asked Ethan quizzically.


“Sure it is,” Jack replied confidently. “That’s why alarm clocks work—

if they’re loud enough!”


“Oh, look at the horses!” exclaimed Amy excitedly.

“They’re galloping!”


“All right, kiddos. I think we should all sit back and relax. When we are

in the city, I will share my knowledge and wisdom with you, whether

you like it or not! In the meantime, enjoy the view.” With that, Jack sat

back and stared contentedly out of the train window.


**Show Image U5.L8.4:**
The four travelers in busy, loud NYC


It was well over two hours before

they reached their destination. As the

four disembarked the train and made

their way out of the train station, a

cacophony of city sounds rose up into the morning air. People were


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**184**


shouting, horns were honking, and traffic was moving in all directions.

~~_What word clues help you to understand what the word cacophony_~~

~~_means? (sounds, shouting, honking)_~~


“It’s so noisy!” screeched Ethan.


“Ethan, hold Jack’s hand please,” instructed Samuel. “Amy, give me

your arm.”


Together the four made their way toward a row of bright yellow

taxicabs parked in front of the train station. Moments later they were

sitting inside one of the cabs on their way to the city harbor. There

they would take a boat ride around the island of Manhattan.


**Show Image U5.L8.5:**
Everyone inside taxi looking out at the
sights


The children stared out of the taxi

windows at the hustle and bustle

of the city. Sunlight glimmered and

shined on the windows that adorned

or decorated the high-rise buildings. As the cab moved through the

congested city streets, they were engulfed by what felt like a wave of

sound and movement.


“As you can tell,” said Jack enthusiastically, looking at the children’s

amazed expressions, “even if you couldn’t see the city, you sure can

hear it. But do you know what sound is and how it travels?” he asked.


“Not really,” Amy replied. Ethan simply shook his head. At that

moment their cab came to a stop again. It was in a long line of cars

trying to turn left, but nothing was moving. Jack took this opportunity

to talk to the children.


“Well, just like light, sound is a form of energy,” Jack continued.

“There are many, many different kinds of sounds. All sound is made

by the movement of objects. That movement is called vibration.

When you pluck a guitar string, the string vibrates, or moves back

and forth. The vibrations make the air shake. The air shakes because

tiny particles in the air have been disturbed by the vibration. Those

vibrations are called sound waves,” said Jack authoritatively.


~~_How did Jack say that light and sound are alike? (Both are forms_~~

~~_of energy.) All sound is made by what? (the movement of objects)_~~

~~_What is that movement called? (vibrations) What does a vibration_~~

~~_do? (makes the air shake) Why does the air shake? (Tiny particles in_~~

~~_the air are disturbed.) The vibrations are called _____? (sound waves)_~~

~~_Show Image Cards C.U5.L8.2 (Guitar) and C.U5.L8.3 (Recorder). If_~~

~~_the guitar makes a sound by plucking the string, how does a wind_~~

~~_instrument like this recorder make sound? (Vibrations are caused_~~

~~_by the flow of air around and through the instrument, which disturbs_~~

~~_particles in the air and allows the vibrations to travel as sound waves.)_~~


**Show Image U5.L8.6:**
Objects producing different sounds


“That’s cool,” said Ethan who was

listening intently. “So, just as light

enters our eyes in light waves, the

sounds of the horns, people, and cars

rushing by enter our ears in sound waves,” he offered.


“Exactly,” said Jack cheerfully. “Sound waves move outward from a

vibrating object, kind of like ripples of water. Just like light, sound

waves can travel through solids, liquids, and gases. Sometimes we

can feel very strong vibrations through solid objects like the ground

or the hard floor of a building.”


“Interestingly, though,” Jack continued enthusiastically, “sound waves

cannot travel through space.”


“Why not?” asked Amy.


“Well, unlike light, sound cannot travel through space because it is

quite nearly a vacuum. There are almost no particles to disturb in the

vacuum of space. For example, think about a rocket that can be seen

shooting through space. You might be able to see it, but it simply

cannot be heard,” Jack explained.



Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**186**


“Wow,” pondered Ethan. “It’s strange that something that is so loud

on Earth would be silent in space!”


Jack added, “Light waves travel better when there are fewer particles,

and sound waves travel better when there are more particles. The

very fact that space is a vacuum is what allows light waves to travel

so quickly through it. On the other hand, the vacuum of space doesn’t

allow sound to travel through it at all!”


_Suddenly Samuel announced, “We’re here!”_


~~_How are sound waves and light waves alike when they travel? (They_~~

~~_both can travel through solids, liquids and gases.) How are they_~~

~~_different? (Light can travel through space but sound cannot.)_~~

Four travelers on a boat leaning over

Samuel paid the taxicab driver, and the

four travelers made their way toward

the big sign that said “Harbor Tours.”

Before long they were onboard a tour boat and were busily munching

on hot dogs, pizza, and pretzels. As they gazed out into the harbor

filled with a variety of boats, the warm breeze ruffled Ethan’s hair.


“This is so cool, Granddad!” exclaimed Ethan excitedly. “I can’t wait

for the boat to start moving.”


“I hope you’ve brought your sea legs,” said Jack as he devoured a

salted pretzel ~~.~~ ~~_Has anyone ever heard the phrase “sea legs”? What_~~

~~_does it mean? (If you have sea legs, you have the ability to keep your_~~

~~_balance on a moving boat.)_~~


“Oh, and before I forget, you should also know,” Jack continued, “that

sound waves travel much more slowly than light waves do. Sound

waves travel at different speeds depending on the medium through

which the vibrations are traveling—whether it’s a solid, a liquid, or a

gas. Sound waves travel fastest through solids.”

“Oh,” said Amy. “That is the opposite of light waves, which travel

fastest through a vacuum!”


Samuel smiled at her keen observation.


The captain of the boat tooted the horn and announced that they

were about to set off on a tour around Manhattan.


“And another thing,” said Jack. “On a warm day like today, the sound of

the horn travels faster than it would on a cold day. Do you know why?”


Amy and Ethan shrugged.


“When it is warm, the particles in the air vibrate faster, which causes

the sound waves to travel faster.”


“Awesome!” said Ethan as he stared up at the large horn.


As the boat moved away from its mooring, the captain tooted the

horn again. Ethan listened to the sound of the horn as it seemed to be

carried away by the wind, and thought long and hard about the things

Jack had just explained to him about sound.


~~_Does light or sound travel faster in the air? (light) Tell students_~~

~~_that light travels 850 times faster than sound through the air. What_~~

~~_medium does sound travel fastest through? (solids)._~~


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What is sound?


» Sound is a form of energy that is caused by the vibration of particles and that

travels in waves.


2. **Inferential.** How do we sense the vibrations of sound waves?


» Our ears receive the sound waves and help us to hear. We can also feel vibrations

through solid objects.



Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**188**


3. **Evaluative.** You heard the word _cacophony_ in the story. What does it mean?


» harsh, unpleasant noise; lots of loud noises together


4. **Evaluative.** What does the setting of this part of the story have to do

with cacophony?


» They are in New York, which is a big city that has many sounds like talking, cars,

taxis, etc.


5. **Evaluative.** What is the loudest place you have ever been?


» Answers will vary.


6. **Evaluative.** Was it a cacophony of sound or was it pleasant sounds? Use

descriptive words.


7. **Evaluative.** Compare and contrast the setting from our earlier stories at

Samuel’s home to the setting of this part of the story.


» Answers will vary.


  - Say, “I am going to ask a question. I will give you a minute to think about the
question and then I will ask you to turn to your neighbor and discuss the
question. Then, I’ll call on several of you to share what you discussed with
your partner.”


8. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share._ When you experience a thunderstorm, do you
see the lightning first or hear the thunder first? Why do you think this is?


» Because light travels faster than sound, you see the lightning before you hear

the thunder.


Do your other senses detect thunder or lightning?


» You can feel thunder vibrate your house or the ground. Some people can

“taste” lightning because the lightning releases ions (electrically charged

particles) into the air, which combine with the saliva in your mouth, to

produce a bitter tasting solution.


~~**WORD WORK: VIBRATION (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _vibration_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed.
Review syllable division patterns at this time as well.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “All sound is made by the movement of objects.
That movement is called _vibration_ .”


3. Say the word _vibration_ with me.


4. A _vibration_ is a rapid movement back and forth.


Lesson 8 What Is Sound?, Part 1
**189**


5. The vibration of the guitar strings made a beautiful sound.


6. Have you ever heard a vibration? What was causing the vibration? If it was a
musical instrument, then what was that instrument? Be sure to use the word
_vibration_ when you speak about it.


                 - Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’
responses to make complete sentences: “I heard a vibration from,” or
“ was causing the vibration.”


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _vibration_ ? ( _vibration_ ; noun)


                 - Use a Discussion and Hands-On activity for follow-up. Have students
observe and discuss different types of vibrations. Have students put their
hands to their throats and hum or speak to feel the vibration of their voice.
Demonstrate the tuning fork again. Discuss different musical instruments
that produce vibrations (e.g., violin, harp, recorder, guitar). Stretch a rubber
band across a cup and show students the vibration. As students share, make
sure that they use the word _vibration_ in a complete sentence.


~~**MULTIPLE-MEANING WORD: MEDIUM (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.3.B**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud, you heard the word _medium_ as in, “Sound waves travel at

different speeds depending on the medium.” Who can tell me what _medium_

means in this example?


» a type of substance or material through which something can travel—in this, case

sound energy


2. What are the three types of mediums mentioned in the Read-Aloud?


» solids, liquids, and gases


3. Show Image Card C.U5.L8.4 (Sound Traveling Through String). What is the

medium in this image?


» the string


What type of medium is it?


» a solid


What form of energy is moving through this solid medium?


» sound


What is an example of a liquid medium for sound?


» sound traveling through water


**TEKS 3.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words and multiple-meaning
words.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**190**


What is an example of a gas medium for sound?


» sound traveling through the atmosphere


Can a vacuum be a medium for sound?


» no


Why not?


» There are no particles to vibrate and cause sound.


4. What other form of energy have you learned about that travels through

different mediums?


» Light and sound travel through different mediums in different ways and at

different speeds. For example, light cannot travel through an opaque solid, such as

a wall, but sound can; sound cannot travel through a vacuum, but light can.


5. The word _medium_ has several other meanings. With your neighbor,

brainstorm as many meanings for _medium_ as you can and discuss ways

you can use the word _medium_ . (Have partners jot down the different

meanings and/or sentences they discover together on index cards, sticky

notes, or scrap paper. Tell students they will revisit these notes at the end of

the activity.)


6. You may hear the word _medium_ in art class, because paint, crayons, chalk,

and clay are all different mediums for art expression. The paint, crayons,

chalk, or clay become the channel through which an artist’s expression is

conveyed to others. (Ask for a volunteer to share a sentence using the word

_medium_ with this meaning.)


7. _Medium_ can also refer to something that is in a middle position or size. For

instance, if you were selecting a medium-sized drink, and it was not the

largest or the smallest, it would be in the middle. (Ask for a volunteer to

share a sentence using the word _medium_ with this meaning.)


8. The word _medium_ can also be used to describe a surrounding environment.
For instance, you might plant flower seeds in a medium like a special potting
soil that would provide excellent nourishment for those seeds to grow.
(Ask for a volunteer to share a sentence using the word _medium_ with
this meaning.)


9. Check your notes to see if you predicted any meanings correctly, or if you
have any other word meanings to share. Now quiz your neighbor on the
different meanings of _medium_ . For example, you could say, “I think the
medium-sized hat fits me best. Which meaning of _medium_ am I using?” And
your neighbor should say, “That meaning of the word _medium_ is a middle
position or size.”

that the literal meaning of this saying is that a dog is more apt to bark loudly
and viciously than it is likely to bite; oftentimes when this saying is used, it is
referring to a person who may talk in a harsh tone, but is actually harmless.
Instead of Jack saying, “His bark is worse than his bite,” he could have said,
“Don’t worry, Alfie is harmless.”


  - Ask the following questions:


1. Do you think Alfie barking means that he would bite? Why or why not?


» No, Alfie just barks because he is excited.


2. What do you think Samuel meant when he says to Jack, “You mean

like yours?”


» Samuel was joking that “Jack’s bark is worse than his bite,” meaning that his

grumpy talk is harmless and that Jack wouldn’t hurt anyone.

question: “What causes sound?”


                 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and call on a
student to answer.


» Sound is caused by vibrations, such as when something moves back and forth

very quickly.


                 - Have students hum while feeling their throats just under the chin. Ask them
to pay attention to the “buzzing” feeling in their throats.

  - Have students give you a thumbs-up if they feel the “buzzing” vibration.


  - Ask, “What in your throats is causing the vibration?”


» When you hum, the vocal cords in your throat vibrate back and forth.


  - Have students add the following to their Lab Notes to answer the question
“What is it?” Write the word _vibration._


Lesson 9 What Is Sound?, Part 2
**203**


Sound, like light, is a form of energy. Also like
light, sound moves in waves. **Sound waves** move
out from a vibrating object, making the air move
back and forth in a way that we can’t see.



Two things must happen to create a sound. First,
something needs to vibrate and create **sound waves** .
Then, something like air or another **medium** needs
to carry the **sound waves** . You hear sounds more
clearly if you are close to whatever is vibrating and
making the **sound waves** . The farther away that the
**sound waves** spread out, the weaker they get. That
is why you can hear a friend standing right next to
you better than if they are calling to you from across
the street.



_This is what a_ _**sound wave**_ _might look like if we could see it._


_The next time you turn on your radio or TV, lightly put your fingers on the_
_speakers. Do you feel the sound vibrations?_

out more.”


                 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have
students answer.


» Sound waves move out from a vibrating object, making the air move back and

forth in a way that we can’t see.


                 - Ask, “What two things are needed to create sound?”


» The two things needed to create sound are something to vibrate and create sound

waves and something, like air or another medium, to carry the sound waves.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**204**


  - Ask, “Why are some sounds easier to hear than others?”


» The farther away sound waves spread out from their source, the weaker they get.


  - Ask, “How are sound waves and light waves similar?”


» The farther away they are from their source, the weaker they get.


  - Direct students’ attention to the bottom images on **page 71** and ask them to
read the caption.


  - Have students add the following to the Lab Notes: To answer the
question “How do we get it?” write _vibrating waves_ and draw a wavy line
under the words.


Lesson 9 What Is Sound?, Part 2
**205**


Sound travels not only through air, which is a
gas, but through other **mediums** . In fact, sound can
travel through solids, liquids, and gases.

Think about sound traveling through solids, like
a window or even a closed door. If you are close
enough, you can still hear sounds on the other side
of a window or door.

How about liquids? Have you ever been
underwater in a swimming pool when you have
heard someone’s voice or another sound? It probably
sounded different than it would if you were not
under water, but you were still able to hear it. This
is an example of sound traveling through a liquid—
the water in the pool.

One place that sound cannot travel is in outer
space. Sound cannot travel through the emptiness,
or vacuum, of space. There is no sound in outer
space because there is no **medium** to carry it.


_Sound travels through solids, liquids, and gases (air)._

- Have students add the following to the Lab Notes: To further answer the

question, “How do we get it?” under the wavy line, have students write the
word _medium_ and shade the area behind the word.



Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**206**


You might wonder about the speed at which
sound travels. **Sound waves** travel much slower than
light waves. **Sound waves** travel at about 750 miles
per hour. That’s fast, but not close to the 186,000
miles per second that light can travel. It would
take a sound 33 hours to travel around Earth once _._
Remember that light can go seven times around
Earth every second !

Here’s an example to prove that light travels
faster than sound. Think about the last time you
were around a storm with thunder and lightning.
Did you notice that you saw each flash of lightning
before you heard the clap of thunder? That’s because
light travels faster than sound!


_During a storm, you will see lightning before you hear thunder. That is_
_because light travels faster than sound._


74 75


**Pages 74–75**

  - Ask students to read **page 75** to themselves to find the answer to the
question “Which travels faster, sound or light?”


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have

students answer.


» Light travels much faster.


  - Remind students that light travels at different speeds depending on what it
is traveling through. Ask, “Does sound travel at a different speed than light?
How do you know?”


» Yes, because you can see lightning before you hear thunder.


  - Have students add the following to the Lab Notes: In the row labeled “Speed
of Sound vs. Speed of Light,” write SOUND, 750 Miles Per Hour on the left
and draw a snail underneath. Write LIGHT, 186,000 Miles Per Second on the
right and draw a rabbit underneath.


Lesson 9 What Is Sound?, Part 2
**207**


The **medium** through which sound travels
affects its rate of speed. Interestingly, **sound waves**
travel fastest through solids. In old western movies,
you may have seen a cowboy put his ear down to
the steel railroad tracks to hear if a train is coming.
That is because the sound travels faster through the
steel than through the air.

Try this. Listen while you drum your fingers on
your desk. Now, rest your ear right on the surface of
the desk and drum your fingers again. Which way
sounded louder?

The sound was louder when you put your head
on the desk. This is because the sound traveling
through the solid wood of your desk traveled
faster than if it had first traveled through the air.
Every time sound changes **mediums**, it loses some
of its loudness.


_Sound travels fastest through solids, such as the wood of your desk or a wall._


76 77


**Pages 76–77**

                 - Have students read **page 76** to themselves to find the answer to the question
“Does sound travel faster through a solid or a gas?”


                 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have
students answer.


» Sound travels faster through a solid.


                  - Ask students to tap their desk with their fingers and listen. Then have
students put one ear down on their desks and listen to the tapping again.
Ask, “Which is louder, when you have your head up or when your ear is
on the desk?”


» when your ear is on the desk


                  - If there is time, have students try listening through other mediums, such as a
piece of paper, the classroom door, or a window, and share their experiences.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**208**


  - As students add the following to their Lab Notes: Tell them that even though
the chapter didn’t mention liquids on this page, sound travels faster through
liquids than gases but not as fast as through solids. (Refer to the illustration
on **page 77** .)


  - Have students add the following to their Lab Notes:


    - To answer the question “How does it travel?” write FASTEST and SOLID
(DOOR) and draw a door.


    - Write FASTER and LIQUID (WATER) and draw a glass of water.

 - Remind students that:


   - Sound is caused by vibrations.


   - Sound travels through mediums.


   - Sounds travel fast through gases, faster through liquids, and fastest
through solids. Sound cannot travel through space because it is a vacuum
and sound needs a medium in order to travel.


   - Sound travels slower than light.


 - Ask students to turn to the table of contents, locate the chapter, and then

turn to the first page of the chapter.

  - Ask students to read **page 82** to themselves to find the answer to the
question “What creates changes in pitch? Why is one sound high-pitched and
another low-pitched?”


  - When students have finished reading, restate the questions and have
students answer.


» Faster vibrations produce shorter sound waves, which make sounds with a higher

pitch. Slower vibrations produce sounds with longer sound waves, which make

sounds with a lower pitch.


  - Then, ask students, “What kind of vibrations produce the sound waves of a

baby crying?”


» faster vibrations


  - Finally, ask students, “What kind of vibrations produce the sound waves of an

adult yelling?”

Travelers eating ice cream cones


The children had a great time on the

boat tour of Manhattan. They had

admired the Statue of Liberty, Ellis

Island, and the Brooklyn Bridge, and

had especially enjoyed waving to passengers on other boats that

passed them by. ~~_Who can tell me why the Statue of Liberty and Ellis_~~

~~_Island are signifcant? (Students may recall from Grade 2 Immigration_~~

Once they were back on land, Samuel insisted that they all have ice

cream. No one protested. They stood on the edge of the curb as

Samuel waved his cane in the air in the hope of attracting a taxi.


“It looks like you are planning to attack someone with a large stick!”

Jack exclaimed.


Both Amy and Ethan burst out laughing.


“I’m trying to hail a taxi,” Samuel explained.


“Well, I don’t know if I would stop!” yelled Jack. “I think I would fear

for my life.”


Nevertheless, after a few minutes of cane waving, a taxi slowed

to a halt. The driver poked his head out of the window and asked,

“Where to?”


“Lincoln Center,” Jack replied.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound

Cab pulling up to Lincoln Center


Jack had arranged for them to attend

an afternoon concert at the Lincoln

Center. They were going to listen

to an orchestra made up of young

musicians from all over the United States. After the concert, they

were going to have dinner before catching the train home.


The traffic seemed to be moving a little faster than it had been

earlier in the day, and before they knew it they had arrived at their

destination. Once again, they paid the taxi driver and piled out of

the cab. Immediately, Jack took charge and led them toward an

impressive building known as Avery Fisher Hall.


Inside the main door, Jack collected four tickets from the box office,

and after showing the tickets to a member of the staff, they were

handed programs and directed to their seats. ~~_What is an impressive_~~

~~_building? Does the image give you a clue?_~~

Inside the concert hall


Jack had bought tickets in the first

balcony to the left of the stage. They

sat down together in the comfortable

plush seats and took in the beautiful

sights and sounds of the famous concert hall.


“What sort of music will we hear?” asked Ethan.


“The musicians are going to play music from well-known movies. I

think you’ll enjoy it, Ethan,” explained Jack.


“Which movies?” asked Amy.


“Take a look in the program,” advised Samuel. “There you will find the

titles of all the pieces being played today.”

**Hearing Aid**



Amy and Ethan immediately began to scour the pages of

the program.


**Show Image U5.L10.4**
Jack telling about playing his violin


Turning to the children, Jack said,

“As you know, I am a musician who

has been composing and playing

combinations of carefully arranged

musical notes most of my life. Each musical note has a particular

sound. When you combine these sounds successfully, the end

result is a perfectly harmonious musical composition.” ~~_What is the_~~

~~_word Jack used to describe a written piece of music? (composition)_~~

~~_What is the root word in composition? (compose) What do you think_~~

~~_harmonious means? What is the root word?_~~


“So, music is like the gift of sound,” Ethan mused.


“That’s a nice way to think about it,” Amy replied.


Jack reached into his pocket and pulled out a small hearing aid and

placed it inside his left ear.


“Jack, I didn’t know you used a hearing aid,” Amy said.


“Yes, the audiologist I went to see gave this device to me. I should use

it more than I do,” replied Jack. “Today I want to make sure that I can

hear these wonderful musicians.” ~~_What does the root in audiologist_~~

“He doesn’t wear it when I am talking to him,” announced Samuel.


“What would be the point of that?” joked Jack. He was no longer

yelling. It was clear that the hearing aid was helping him to hear.

Orchestra playing


Before long it was time for the concert

to begin. The lights began to dim, the

musicians appeared, the conductor

took his place, and the sound of music

burst forth into the air. ~~_Point to the conductor in the image and ask,_~~

~~_“What does a conductor do?”_~~


The orchestra played a number of well-known pieces. Amy and Ethan

recognized some of them from their favorite movies. They watched

and listened intently as the musicians played.


After about forty-five minutes, the lights in the concert hall

brightened for the intermission, and people began to stretch their

legs and wander out into the atrium, or entrance hall.


**Show Image U5.L10.6**
String and bass instruments


Jack pointed to the violinist, who was

adjusting the tightness of the strings

on his instrument. ~~_Point to the violin_~~

~~_and explain that it is classified as a_~~

~~_member of the string family of instruments._~~ ~~_Ask if anyone can name_~~

~~_other stringed instruments. (guitar, harp, banjo, etc.)_~~


“Have I ever explained to you how my favorite instrument, the violin,

works?” asked Jack. “The strings of the violin determine how high or

low its sound is. The thickness, tightness, and length of the strings all

make a difference in the kind of sound it makes.”


“I love when you play the violin,” said Amy, smiling.


“What’s that instrument called, Jack?” Ethan asked curiously,

pointing to a large brass instrument toward the back of the orchestra.


Lesson 10 Characteristics of Sound
**231**


Support


Explain that brass is a type
of metal.



“Oh, the tuba! Another one of my favorites!” exclaimed Jack with

pleasure. ~~_The tuba is classified as a brass instrument. Can anyone_~~

~~_name other brass instruments? (French horn, trumpet, trombone)_~~


“The musician blows on the mouthpiece to produce the vibrations

inside the instrument. His fingers press the valves, or buttons, on the

tuba. This changes the length of the tube through which the air flows.”


“Let me guess!” cried Amy. “The length of the air tube makes the

sound lower or higher!”


“You would make a fine musician!” beamed Jack.


“Or maybe a scientist,” Amy responded proudly.

Comparison of drums’ intensity showing
loud and soft sounds


“This might sound like a silly

question,” said Amy, “but what makes

sound loud or soft?”


“That’s not a silly question at all,” replied Jack. “You see, the loudness

or softness of a sound is caused by the amount of energy being

carried in the vibration. The greater the intensity, or power, of a sound

wave, the louder the sound. Think about the difference between a

drum that is tapped lightly and one that is struck very hard. When the

drummer taps lightly, there is less energy applied to the drum—less

energy means lower intensity and a softer sound. When the same

drum is struck with greater energy, the sound has higher intensity

and it’s—loud!”


**Show Image U5.L10.8**
Comparison of two different
drums’ pitches


“I see,” said Ethan. “I have another

question. What is pitch?



Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**232**


I heard that word in music class, but I didn’t know what it meant,”

Ethan continued.


“Another excellent question,” said Jack. “In order to explain that,

let me go back a step or two. When an object vibrates, such as the

top of a drum, it does not produce just one sound wave, but many

sound waves per second. The faster something vibrates, the shorter

the wavelengths it produces. For example, the top of a larger drum

vibrates more slowly than the top of a smaller drum. The tightness

and thickness of the top of the drum make a difference, too.”


Jack took a breath and Samuel jumped in, “If the sound waves have

a short wavelength, there are many waves per second. If the waves

have a longer wavelength, there are fewer waves per second.”


Amy and Ethan giggled as Jack glared at Samuel.


“The rate at which sound waves are produced is known as the

frequency of sound,” resumed Jack. ~~_Hold up Image Card C.U5.L7.1_~~

~~_(Light Energy from the Sun) and Image Card C.U5.L8.5 (Sound Waves_~~

~~_Entering the Ear). Explain that both light waves and sound waves are_~~

~~_measured in wavelengths and can have both high and low frequencies._~~


Amy nodded. “I see. So, a sound with a long wavelength and fewer

waves per second, like the sound produced by the larger drum, has a

low frequency, whereas one with a short wavelength and more waves

per second, like the sound produced by the smaller drum, has a

high frequency?”


“Exactly,” said Jack. “And to answer your first question, pitch

describes how high or low a sound wave sounds.”


“Oh, I understand now,” said Amy cheerily. “High frequency sound

waves have high pitches, and low frequency sound waves have low

pitches.” ~~_Show Image Card C.U5.L10.3 (Violin and Bass)._~~ ~~_Which_~~

~~_instrument would produce higher frequency vibrations? (violin)._~~ ~~_Would_~~

~~_it have a higher or lower pitch than the bass? (higher) Why? (The_~~

“So, the sound of a bird chirping is a high-pitched sound, but the

sound of a cow mooing is a low-pitched sound,” burst in Ethan, who

was now mooing loudly like a cow.


“You’ve got it,” said Jack. “Variations in sound waves cause sounds

with different qualities.”

Before long, the musicians and the

conductor returned to the stage.

Samuel, Jack, Amy, and Ethan sat

back and enjoyed the rest of the

concert. Each musical composition created an atmosphere of its own.

The audience listened attentively and applauded enthusiastically,

especially when the better-known pieces were played. Music from

well-known superhero movies, fantasy movies, and Disney movies

were particularly well received. The music recreated magical images

and brought back memories for each member of the audience.

Everyone having dinner


When the concert was over, Samuel

and Jack took the children to their

favorite Italian restaurant. The

restaurant was less than a block from

the concert hall, and the four laughed and joked as they walked to the

restaurant and talked about their favorite parts of the concert.


“I wish we could have brought Alfie to the city!” said Ethan eagerly.


Jack shook his head. “Alfie would have gone crazy! You know all

of those loud sounds we heard today? He would have heard even

more sounds.”


“What do you mean?” asked Amy.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**234**


“Well, have you ever seen someone using a dog whistle? A dog

whistle produces a very high sound; the frequency is so high that

we cannot hear it, but dogs can. Alfie is able to hear a greater range

of sounds—higher pitch sounds and lower pitch sounds—than we

can hear. As with light, some wavelengths or frequencies cannot be

sensed by humans.”


“Oh, wow,” said Ethan. “Maybe that’s why Alfie can always hear

a thunderstorm coming before we do! The storm must produce

vibrations that are too low for us to hear.”


“Yup,” said Jack.


Over dinner, Samuel and Jack recalled how they, too, had been taken

on a trip to the city when they were young.


“When we were in the fourth grade, your grandfather’s father took

us to a concert at Carnegie Hall. That was the day I decided that I

wanted to be a professional musician,” recalled Jack.


Samuel smiled. “I remember that day as if it were yesterday,” he said.


Jack smiled, too. “My life was never the same after that experience.”


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** What is the setting for most of this Read-Aloud?

What are some adjectives and other words you could use to describe this setting?


» large, beautiful, impressive, crowded, exciting, elegant, etc.


2. **Evaluative.** What are some sources of sound that the characters heard

inside the concert hall?


» Answers may vary, but may include applause, people talking, musicians tuning up,

orchestra playing, etc.


3. **Inferential.** How does the frequency of sound waves affect the pitch of

a sound?


» High frequency waves have a higher pitch, or higher sound. Low frequency sound

waves have a lower pitch, or lower sound.

question, and then I will ask you to turn to your neighbor and discuss the
question. Finally, I will call on several of you to share what you discussed with
your partner.”


7. **Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share._ How do pitch, frequency, and intensity affect
the qualities and variations of the sounds we hear? You may use examples
to explain.


» Answers may vary but should include content vocabulary.


~~**WORD WORK: FREQUENCY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _frequency_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed.
Review syllable division patterns at this time as well.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard, “The rate at which sound waves are produced
is known as the frequency of sound.”


3. Say the word _frequency_ with me.


4. The _frequency_ of sound is how often sound waves are produced; sound
waves can have a high frequency or a low frequency. _Frequency_ also means
the number of times something happens within a particular period of time.


5. Tobias knew that the sound of the jet engine had a high frequency because it
was producing many sound waves in a short period of time.


6. Have you ever heard something that had a high or low frequency? Be sure to
use the word _frequency_ when you tell about it.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**236**


 - Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the

students’ responses to make complete sentences: “I heard a high/low
frequency,” or “ had a high/low frequency.”


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the

word _frequency_ ?


» _frequency_ ; noun


 - Use a Brainstorm and Discussion activity for follow-up. Have students

discuss different types of sounds they have heard, making a list of highfrequency and low-frequency sounds. You may choose to provide a theme,
such as animal sounds or instrument sounds. You may also choose to
discuss the correlation of frequency to pitch. Finally, you may choose to
review the meaning of _frequency_ as it relates to anything that is repeated.
As students add to and review the list, make sure that they use the word
_frequency_ in a complete sentence.

~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 5, Lesson 10**

  - Students are likely to make the following errors


    - For ‘ay’, students may write ‘ai’ or ‘ea’


    - For ‘ai’, students may write ‘ay’ or ‘ea’


    - For ‘ea’, students may write ‘ay’ or ‘ai’


  - While the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be aware

that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to
record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.
For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular
beginning consonants?


  - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


  - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization
and punctuation.


  - Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

    - What is _frequency_ ?

    - How does it affect the pitch of the sound that is made?


  - Ask students to predict how they think their bodies produce their voices.


  - Ask students, “If you could not speak, how else would you communicate?”
Explain that people who cannot use their voice boxes to speak are _mute_ . Tell
students that people who are mute have the ability to communicate with
others using sign language and the written word. Explain that there is also
technology that helps people who cannot speak to communicate effectively.


  - Tell students to listen carefully to learn more about voice and to see whether
or not their predictions about how our voices are produced are correct.

Many weeks passed before Samuel,

Jack, Amy, and Ethan were able to

spend some time together again.

After a long, hot summer, school had

reopened, and the children were also involved in after-school sports.

During that time, Samuel had undergone eye surgery to remove

cataracts from his eyes, and Jack now had to wear his hearing aid

all the time.


The outside world had changed, too. Fall had arrived. Green leaves

had been replaced by a montage of copper, red, yellow, and brown

leaves. Gone was the warm morning air, and in its place was a chilly

morning breeze. There were many mornings when frost lay on the

ground. Everyone was looking forward to Thanksgiving as a joyful

holiday to spend with family and friends.


It was a Saturday morning, and Jack was sitting in Samuel’s kitchen.

The two men were playing their weekly game of chess. They had first

played chess together when they were third-grade classmates.

They had not been playing for long

when Amy and Ethan arrived and

scampered eagerly into the kitchen,

closely pursued by Alfie. They had

come to visit their grandfather, and Amy had some exciting news to

share with him.


“Slow down, slow down,” advised Samuel. “You’ll go crashing into the

wall if you aren’t careful!” he warned. As Samuel spoke, Alfie wagged

his tail and promptly sat down on Ethan’s feet.


“Hello, Granddad,” said Amy cheerfully. “How are you?”


“I’m very well,” replied Samuel cheerily. “What have you

troublemakers been up to?”


“It’s almost Thanksgiving,” said Ethan excitedly. “We’re going to sing

in a concert at school.”


“You are, are you?” said Jack. “Well, I hope we’re invited to hear

you sing.”


“Oh, yes, you are,” chimed in Amy. “We brought you tickets—see?”

Amy held up two tickets.


“It’s next Wednesday, and you have front row seats. The third,

fourth, and fifth grade classes are going to sing traditional songs

from around the world. My class is singing ‘An Irish Lullaby,’”

Amy explained.


“My class is going to sing a French song called ‘Frère Jacques,’”

said Ethan.

“Sounds very entertaining,” said Jack, as he contemplated his next

move on the chess board. “You know, each human voice is quite

unique. Each voice has its own tone. That’s the reason why you can

recognize a person by his or her voice,” explained Jack ~~.~~ ~~_What does_~~

~~_contemplated mean? (thought)_~~


“Our voices are as unique as we are,” Samuel agreed. “Only I have

my voice.”


“Precisely,” agreed Jack. “However, although human voices differ

from one another, they are all produced in the same way.”


“They are?” said Ethan.


“Indeed they are,” Jack continued, having finally decided to move one

of his bishops. ~~_Hold up Image Card C.U5.L11.1 (Anatomy of a Voice)_~~

~~_before reading the next section. Point to each body part as you read._~~


“If you could see inside your body, you would discover that inside

your throat, at the top of your windpipe, or trachea, is your voice

box. The voice box is also known as the larynx. Within your larynx are

two bands of muscle called vocal cords. These vocal cords enable

humans to make a wide range of sounds.” ~~_Point back to Image_~~

“Neat,” said Ethan. “But how is the sound made?”



Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**246**


“It’s not as complicated as you might think,” explained Jack. “When

you breathe in, your vocal cords relax so that air can reach your lungs.

When you breathe out, a muscle called the diaphragm moves upward

to force air out of your body. When you speak, air leaves your body, too.

Your lungs and diaphragm force air through the opening in your throat,

past the vocal cords. This movement of air causes the vocal cords to

vibrate, and so sound is produced. As your vocal cords tighten and

relax, different sounds are produced.” ~~_Refer back to Image U5.L11.3._~~

“I’m coming, too,” Amy announced,

“See you on Wednesday at the concert,” said Ethan.


“You will indeed,” said Samuel.


“I’ll continue my lesson then,” threatened Jack.

School auditorium


Before they knew it, Wednesday had

arrived. It was a cool day, and rain

had been forecast. Samuel and Jack

arrived early and took their seats in

the front of the school auditorium.

Thirty minutes later the auditorium was full, and parents waited

anxiously to see their children perform ~~.~~ ~~_Listen to the word auditorium._~~

Samuel’s daughter, Anna, and her husband, John, had also arrived

and were eager to hear Amy and Ethan sing.


First up was Ethan’s class singing “Frère Jacques,” a traditional French

song. Behind them was a large screen with an image of the Eiffel

Tower displayed on it. The children sang the song perfectly. Samuel

and Jack smiled proudly. “I can hear Ethan’s voice distinctly!” said

Jack. ~~_Ask a volunteer to point to the image of the Eiffel Tower. The_~~

When the concert was over, the family

walked together to the local café for

hot chocolate. They took their seats,

and minutes later they were all sipping

mugs of hot chocolate piled high with

marshmallows.


As they talked about the show, Jack complimented the children on

their singing.


“My teacher says I have perfect pitch,” said Amy proudly.


“What’s that?” Ethan asked, looking puzzled.


Amy was happy to explain, “When my chorus teacher is ready for my

class to sing, she likes us to start on the note of middle C. Instead of

her playing it on the piano, I just sing it.”


“Wow!” said Jack. “Did I tell you that the pitch of your voice is

determined by the size of your larynx and vocal cords?”


“No, you didn’t,” chimed in Ethan with marshmallow on his top lip.


**Show Image U5.L11.8**
Everyone talking and laughing


“That’s why a young child’s voice

is generally higher in pitch than an

adult’s,” explained Jack. “The larger

your larynx and vocal cords, the louder

and lower your voice is. The pitch

of your voice is also determined by the tension of the surrounding

muscles. Trained singers learn how to control these muscles to

produce variations in pitch and intensity.” ~~_Why would singers want to_~~

~~_produce variations in pitch and intensity in their voices?_~~

Explain that musical
notes are named after the
letters ABCDEFG. Middle
C is the note in the middle

pitch or higher notes.

“Oh, so that’s what it means to train your voice,” said Amy. “And I bet

men usually have longer vocal cords than women and that’s why their

2. **Literal.** What body parts do you see that work together to produce your

voice?


» lungs, diaphragm, vocal cords, trachea, and larynx or voice box


3. **Literal.** What is the name of the muscle below the lungs that also helps

to produce your voice by allowing air to move in and out of the body?


» diaphragm


4. **Inferential.** How are variations created in voices?


» Larger larynxes and voice boxes produce lower sounds; trained singers can learn

to produce variations; the way the air passes out of the body affects the vibration

and therefore the voice; etc.


5. **Evaluative.** What can you do to make your voice have a higher pitch to

it? How can you make your voice have a lower pitch to it? You may wish to

allow students to experiment with their own voices before answering.


» Answers may vary, but may include tightening or relaxing your vocal cords, and

changing your breath using your diaphragm.


 - Say, “I am going to ask a question. I will give you a minute to think about the

question, and then I will ask you to turn to your neighbor and discuss the
question. Finally, I will call on several of you to share what you discussed with
your partner.”


6. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share._ Who are some people you can recognize just

by voice? Are there some singers or actors you can recognize just from their
voice? What do you think it would be like if we all sounded the same or were
not able to produce variations in our voices?

 - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone else say “actions speak louder
than words.” Have the students repeat the proverb. Ask students, “What are
actions?” Generate a list of action words (verbs) as a class.


 - Ask students, “Can any of these actions we listed actually speak? What is
the name of the literary device that describes when an animal or a nonliving
thing acts like a human?”


» personification


 - Explain that actions do not really speak, but the things we do can make more
of a statement than the things we say. For example, it can be easy to say
that you are someone’s friend, but to actually show this with your actions,
perhaps by being loyal, makes a bigger impact.


 - Instead of saying “actions speak louder than words,” Samuel could have

said, “Jack, you may say you are smarter than I am, but your actions, such as
reeling Alfie in with a fishing pole without realizing it, show that you are not
smarter than I am!”


 - Ask students if they ever faced a situation where someone’s actions made
an impression on them and were more powerful than any words that could
have been said. Give students an opportunity to share their experiences, and
encourage them to use the saying.


 - Tell students to listen for times when this phrase is appropriate as they

continue listening to the story. Try to find other opportunities to use this
saying in the classroom.

these muscles to produce variations in pitch and intensity.”


3. Say the word _variations_ with me.


_4. Variations_ are changes in the amount, form, or level of something.


5. Marissa was an expert at playing the saxophone because she could make
multiple variations, or changes, to the sound of her instrument.


6. Have you ever heard variations in sound? Be sure to use the word _variations_
when you tell about it.

  - Review with students what they learned in the previous chapter by referring
to the Lab Notes from previous lessons.


  - Remind students of the following: The greater the intensity or power of a
sound wave, the louder the volume of the sound.


    - High-pitched sounds are created when an object or surface vibrates back
and forth quickly, creating shorter and more sound waves.


    - Low-pitched sounds are caused when an object or surface vibrates back
and forth slowly, creating longer and fewer sound waves.


  - Remind students that in an earlier lesson in this unit, they heard Jack and
Samuel talking about the human voice and the parts of your body that are
used for speech.


  - Ask students to spend a few moments recalling what Jack and Samuel said
about the trachea, larynx, and vocal cords.


» If you could see inside your body, you would discover that inside your throat, at

the top of your windpipe, or trachea, is your voice box. The voice box is also known

so often that you can tell right away who it is. Each
person has a distinct voice. It’s a voice that can make
many sounds with different pitch and intensity. It
can make high- and low-pitched sounds, loud and
soft sounds.

When you were a baby, you did not need to learn
how to breathe. Your **lungs** worked **automatically**,
bringing air into and out of your body. You also did
not need to learn how to use your vocal cords to
make sounds. When you were a baby, you made lots
of funny noises and grunts. Ask your parents!

You did, however, need to learn how to change
those grunts and noises into words so you could
talk. You did this by listening to the people who
talked to you when you were a baby. You practiced
saying the same sounds and words. You learned to
speak whatever language all of those people were
speaking to you. If your family spoke only English
to you, you learned to speak English. If your family
spoke only Spanish to you, you learned to speak
Spanish. People can learn to speak more than one
language. Maybe you or some of your classmates
speak more than one language.

_people around you were speaking._

Your vocal cords grow as you grow. When you
have shorter vocal cords, you tend to speak at a
higher pitch. This is why small children have higherpitched voices than adults. The pitch of your voice
depends on the size of your vocal cords and **larynx** .

The volume of your voice, or how loudly you
speak, depends on how much air is produced by
your **lungs** and comes out of your mouth. When
more air is pushed out of your mouth, your voice
will be louder.

**Note:** Students will be conducting a short research project, which will

be introduced in Lesson 13. If possible, students should spend at least

one class session in a computer lab to find information on their topic.

Additionally, you can coordinate with your school media specialist to find

books on Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and the invention of the

telephone and the light bulb so that they may be used in your classroom

during this writing project.


 - The final writing task for the research project is to write a newspaper
article about either the invention of the telephone or the invention of the
incandescent light bulb. A part of the instruction will require students to
look at and analyze parts of a newspaper, taking note of text features such
as headlines, subtitles, graphics, captions, bold words, etc. Have several
newspapers on hand for groups of students to review.

Lesson 12 Alexander Graham Bell
**269**


Alexander Bell was born March 3, 1847. He was
the middle of three sons born to Alexander and Eliza
Bell of Edinburgh, Scotland. His parents nicknamed
him “Aleck” as a young boy. Aleck’s childhood was
happy. He lived the best of both worlds by spending
time at his home in the city of Edinburgh and also in
the country on the weekends. More than anything,
Aleck loved to learn new things.

At Milton Cottage near Edinburgh, young Aleck
enjoyed exploring nature. He collected plants and
studied animals.

Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**270**


In school, Aleck’s best subjects were science and
music, which he learned from his mother. Aleck’s
mother was nearly deaf, so she played music mostly
by feel. To hear the music, she would put a **hearing**
**trumpet** to the strings of the instrument. The
**trumpet** magnified the sound.



Aleck’s father was an important speech **professor** .
He studied the sounds of the English language,
similar to the phonics you studied to learn to read.
He very much wanted to help his wife, Eliza, and
other deaf people. In 1864, he invented a “sound
alphabet” called **Visible Speech** . He spent years
coming up with **symbols** to stand for any sound
the human voice could make. The **symbols** that he
used looked the way a person’s mouth looked when
making certain sounds. **Visible Speech** helped deaf
people learn how to talk better so that they could
communicate with others.

different inventions to help
hearing-impaired people.



Lesson 12 Alexander Graham Bell
**271**


The example of both his mother and father was
an **inspiration** for Aleck. He became interested in
inventing things on his own. He especially wanted
to invent things to help other people. Aleck and
his brother actually made a “speaking machine.”
The machine used the voice box (larynx) of a dead
sheep. Part of the machine acted like a mouth and
throat and could say the word “mama.”

As an adult, Aleck worked with deaf students. He
later took a job as a **professor** at Boston University.
Inventing things was a big part of Aleck’s life. After
one invention, he set his mind on others, never
satisfied with the past invention. The invention that
he is most famous for, however, was yet to come.


_When he was young, Aleck and his brother invented a “speaking machine.”_

Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound


Boston, Massachusetts became an important
place for many inventors. The Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) made space in one
of its labs for Aleck to do his experiments. His days
were filled with teaching and then trying over and
over to make human sound travel across a wire. All
of his energy was spent on this creative idea. He
wrote that his idea of using **electric current** to carry
a sound would likely make others think him “crazy.”
So, he kept most of his ideas and experiments secret.

Aleck hired a young mechanic to help him.
Thomas Watson knew how electricity worked.
At first, their experiments failed more than they
succeeded. Aleck thought they were getting closer
to success. “I think the **transmission** of the human
voice is much more nearly at hand than I thought.”
On June 2, 1875, his dreams came true.


_Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson worked together to try to_
_**transmit**_ _sound using electricity._


122 123


Lesson 12 Alexander Graham Bell
**275**


Like many inventions, an accident led to an
important **discovery** . With the electricity turned
off, Watson sent a message to Aleck that Aleck
could hear. He heard tones, not just one singlepitched sound. He knew instantly it was a huge step
forward! “I have (by accident) made a **discovery** of
the very greatest importance,” wrote Bell.

Three days later, the first telephone recorded,
“Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.” To
Bell’s great joy, Watson had heard and understood
what Bell had said!

Fame and fortune came to Alexander Graham
Bell and Thomas Watson. They soon formed the
Bell Telephone Company to make and sell their
new invention.

Bell continued to invent the rest of his life. “Selfeducation is a life-long affair,” said Bell. “There is
no failed experiment,” he said to convince people
to keep going with their ideas. He passed his love
of learning on to his grandchildren and inspired a
whole group of new inventors.

paper between themselves.


  - Divide students into teams of four or five.


  - Pass one blank sheet of paper to a person on each team.


  - Instruct them to draw a vertical line down the center of the paper. Have them
write _light_ on one side of the line and _sound_ on the other side.


  - Tell them that they will be competing against each other to write down as
many inventions that have to do with _light_ as they can in one minute.


  - Tell them that the way it works is that one person writes an invention and
passes it to the next person who has to write a different invention.


  - They will keep passing the paper to the next person until time is up.


  - After one minute, one person from each team will read their answers.


  - The teacher will keep score on the board and will be the decision maker as to
whether it is an appropriate invention for that category or not.


  - After _light_ is completed, repeat the game for the word _sound_ .


  - The team that has the most inventions for each category is the winner.

**Primary Focus:** Students will use the conjunction _and_ to create compound sentences.

~~**TEKS 3.11.D.viii**~~


~~**GRAMMAR: INTRODUCE THE CONJUNCTION AND (25 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.11.D.viii**~~


  - Tell students they will learn more today about the part of speech called a
conjunction; conjunctions will help them build and write more interesting
sentences.


  - Point to the conjunctions poster you prepared and displayed earlier.

**Conjunctions**
**Conjunctions** are words that **connect** other words or groups of words.


    - The conjunction **and** connects words or groups of words. It means plus,
along with, or also.


  - Read the poster to students, emphasizing that the conjunction _and_ joins
words or groups of words together.


  - Read the first two sentences you prepared in advance to students:






- Look at the first simple sentence and ask, “Who or what is the sentence
about?” ( _my grandmother_ )


- Write the letter _S_ above _grandmother_ to show that this is the subject.


- Ask, “What does my grandmother do?” ( _loves ice cream_ )


- Write the letter _P_ above those words to show that this is the predicate.
Draw a line between the subject and the predicate.





**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words;
**TEKS 3.11.D.viii** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including: coordinating conjunctions to form compound
subjects, predicates, and sentences.


Lesson 12 Alexander Graham Bell
**279**


- Look at the second simple sentence and ask, “Who or what is the sentence
about?” ( _my grandfather_ )


- Write the letter _S_ above those words to show that this is the subject.


- Ask, “What is my grandfather doing?” ( _loves pie_ )


- Write the letter _P_ above these words to show that it is the predicate. Draw a
line between the subject and predicate.






- Point out that there are two complete sentences, each with its own subject
and predicate.


- Ask the students if anyone can think of a way to connect the two sentences
using the conjunction _and_ ; call on one student to say the new sentence
aloud. If students seem unsure of where to place the _and_, tell them that
they should keep all of the subjects and predicates in exactly the same
order and just connect the two sentences.


- Write the new sentence on the board using appropriate capitalization
and punctuation.






- Ask, “How many subjects are there in this sentence now?” (two) Label both
subjects with the letter _S_ . ( _grandmother and grandfather_ )


- Ask, “How many predicates are there in this sentence now?” (two) Label both
predicates with the letter _P_ . ( _loves ice cream_ and _loves pie_ )


- Ask, “What word did you add to make this new sentence?” ( _and_ )


- Point out that the word _and_ is the part of speech called a conjunction. Label
the conjunction by drawing two lines underneath it.


- Ask, “What does the conjunction _and_ connect or join?” (the original two
sentences, which are now called independent clauses since they are
combined into one compound sentence)





**Note to Teacher:** A sentence that combines two independent clauses with
the conjunction _and_ is called a compound sentence. In Unit 2, students
learned to recognize compound sentences with the conjunction _and_ ; they


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**280**


learned to distinguish this type of compound sentence from other simple
sentences in which _and_ might be used as a conjunction, but in which there
were not two independent clauses.


 - Remind students that the sentence that they just created is called a
compound sentence because it has two independent clauses, each with its
own subject and predicate, joined by the conjunction _and_ .


 - Read the next two sentences to students:






 - Point out that each sentence has one subject ( _Sandy, Tyler_ ). Label each
subject with the letter _S_ .


 - Ask students to locate the verbs. ( _eats, eats_ ) Point out that each sentence
also has one predicate. ( _eats hot dogs, eats hamburgers_ ) Label each
predicate with the letter _P_ .






- Ask students to orally build a more interesting sentence by joining two
clauses together, making a compound sentence; write the response on the
board. Label the conjunction by underlining it twice.






- Ask, “What word did you add to make a compound sentence?” ( _and_ )


- Ask, “What does the conjunction _and_ connect or join?” (two independent
clauses, _Sandy eats hot dogs_ and _Tyler eats hamburgers_ )


- Read the next two sentences to students.






- Proceed in the same manner as above in identifying the subject and
predicate in each sentence.







Lesson 12 Alexander Graham Bell
**281**


- Point out that there are two complete sentences, each with its own subject

aloud. If students seem unsure of where to place the _and_, tell them that
they should keep all of the subjects and predicates in exactly the same
order and just connect the two sentences.


- Write the new sentence on the board using appropriate capitalization
and punctuation. Draw two lines under the word _and_ to show that it is
a conjunction.

At the age of 12, he worked selling newspapers
on the railroad near his home. On the train, he
heard people talking about many new ideas and
inventions. He learned by listening to their stories.
At 15, Al landed a job working the telegraph
machine. He became an expert telegraph operator
over the next six years. Even though he was deaf, he
could feel the vibration of the wire.

Al liked to work with electric machines. He
found a way to make the telegraph faster and sold
the idea to Western Union Telegraph Company for
$40,000. With the money he made from the sale, he
set up his first lab to continue his experiments.

When the work Al was doing outgrew this lab,
he built a bigger lab in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He
hired some of the smartest scientists and engineers
from around the world to work with him. Much
of his early work was on sound. They called him
the Wizard of Menlo Park because some of the
inventions seemed magical.

  - Ask, “Why was Thomas Edison called the Wizard of Menlo Park?”


» Menlo Park was where his second lab was located. There, many people called him

the Wizard of Menlo Park because some of his inventions seemed magical.


  - Ask, “Was your prediction correct?”


Lesson 13 Thomas Edison: The Wizard of Menlo Park
**289**


In this new lab, he discovered a way to make
Alexander Graham Bell’s new telephone louder. He
sold the **patent** for his new invention for $100,000.
That was a huge sum of money at the time.

His next invention was the **phonograph** . He
was able to record sound on a cylinder wrapped in
tinfoil. He played a version of “Mary Had a Little
Lamb” to his fellow scientists. This was the first
time anyone was able to listen to recorded music.

The invention that Edison is best known
for came next. In 1879, he invented the first
**incandescent** (glowing) electric light bulb. Three
years later, he lit up 85 homes at once in New York
City and the age of electric light began.

By the time Edison “retired,” he had **patents**
on over 1,000 inventions. They include the
**kinetoscope**, which is a machine for showing
movies, and the **microphone** .

What people sometimes forget is that many of
Edison’s experiments “failed” at first. He caused
explosions at his labs and was forced to start all over
many times. However, he kept moving forward each
time. He always had a positive attitude. He knew he
was closer to his next success!

**Note:** If possible, students should spend at least one class session in a

computer lab to find information for their research writing project, preferably

during Lesson 14 or 15. If you cannot secure computer time, students

may find information in _Adventures in Light and Sound_ and in additional

classroom resources and materials you gathered from your school library.


  - The first part of Lesson 14 is the Unit Assessment. If your computer time
is scheduled for this day, change the “Drafting” portion of the lesson to
Lesson 15, leaving the whole writing time for researching on computers.

**Writing**

  - Prepare a poster or use chart paper to show steps in the research and writing

process. The process will be filled in as the project progresses. For this
lesson, make the following chart.


**Write a Research Paper**

~~**GUIDELINES FOR CALCULATING W.C.P.M SCORES**~~


  - If the reading was fairly accurate (fewer than 10 uncorrected errors), you
can get a rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by
noting the time and looking at the chart on Activity Page 14.3.


  - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote

down on the record sheet and follow the steps described below. The steps
are also shown in graphic form on Activity Page 14.3. You will probably find it
helpful to have a calculator available.


1. Complete the Words section of Activity Page 14.3.


2. Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student read
or attempted to read, up to the point where he or she stopped. It includes
words that the student read correctly as well as words that the student
read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the whole
selection, use 400 words total. If the student did not finish the selection, you
will need to count the number of words that the student actually attempted



as needed. **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom! Exploring Light and Sound
**304**


to read. Write the count for Words Read in the matching box on Activity Page
14.3.


3. Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This includes

words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that you had
to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes on
Activity Page 14.3. (A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted
as a mistake. The student is penalized for the time he or she lost making the
correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


4. Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


5. Next, complete the Time section of the worksheet.


6. Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,

this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a
watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the Start
Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract seconds
from seconds and then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in Seconds.
Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to seconds, and
then add the number of seconds.


7. Complete the W.C.P.M. section of the worksheet.


8. Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get Words
Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


  - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


    - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.

scores. A major goal for Grade 3 students, however, is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary from
state to state. The national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in
2006 for Winter of Grade 3 is 92 W.C.P.M.


    - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other

students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Winter of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (62 W.C.P.M) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.

“Class,” said Mr. Brown, “Today we are going to learn some
more about how our eyes work. James, would you please turn out
the lights?”


James walked to the door and switched off the lights. Mr. Brown
closed the blinds. It got darker in the classroom. It was not completely
black. Some light came through the blinds, but not very much. The
children giggled in the dimly lit room.


“Now,” said Mr. Brown. “I’d like all 22 of you to turn and look at the
person who sits next to you. Sally, you look at Mick. Jen, you look at
Stan. That’s it! Lean close and look your partner right in the eyes.
Can you see your partner’s pupils? Remember: the pupil is the black
part in the center of the eye. It’s the part that lets in light from the
outside world.”


Mr. Brown walked over to the door. “Can you all see your
partner’s pupils?”


“Yes!” said the students.


“Keep looking at your partner’s pupils!” said Mr. Brown. Then, he
turned on the lights. In an instant, the room went from dim to bright.


Sally was staring at Mick’s pupils. She watched them shrink.


“Cool!” she called out. “Mick’s pupils got smaller when you turned
on the lights!”


“Sally’s did, too!” said Mick.


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom!: Exploring Light and Sound
**306**


All around the room, students noticed the same thing. When the
lights came on, their partner’s pupils got smaller. Mr. Brown explained:
“The pupil’s job is to let light into the eye and to keep it out. If it’s
dark, your pupil opens wide to let in a lot of light. If it’s bright, your
pupil shrinks to let in less light. This is a reflex. You don’t have to think,
‘I believe I shall open my pupil a bit wider.’ Your pupils work all by
themselves, without you even thinking about it. The pupil is like the
gatekeeper of the eye. It decides what gets in and what has to stay
out.”


“Do it again!” shouted Mick. “Shut off the lights!”


“Okay,” said Mr. Brown. “Keep your eyes on your partner’s pupils.”


He threw the switch. Forty-four pupils grew larger in the dimness.


Mr. Brown waited a few seconds. Then he turned the lights back on.
Forty-four pupils shrank in the bright light.


“So,” said Mr. Brown. “Do we understand what the pupils do?”


The students nodded their heads in agreement.

~~**SPELLING ASSESSMENT (25 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.B.i; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 15.1 for the spelling assessment.


  - Tell students that for this assessment, they will write their words under the
header to which they belong. For example, if you call out the word _cake_, they
would write that word under the header ‘a_e’ >/ae/.


  - Tell students that should a spelling word fit under more than one header, they
should only write the word under one.


**TEKS 3.2.B.i** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables;

  - “We are all capable of spelling our list of words,” said Mrs. Smith’s class.


- You may find it helpful to use the Spelling Analysis Chart found at the end
of this lesson to analyze students’ mistakes. This will help you understand
any patterns that are beginning to develop, or that are persistent among
individual students.


- Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

                   - Explain to students that they will be revising their writing. They will also give
and receive feedback, and they may use digital tools (if available) to revise
and comment on the articles.


Sound, like light, is a form of energy. Also like
light, sound moves in waves. **Sound waves** move
out from a vibrating object, making the air move
back and forth in a way that we can’t see.

Two things must happen to create a sound. First,
something needs to vibrate and create **sound waves** .
Then, something like air or another **medium** needs
to carry the **sound waves** . You hear sounds more
clearly if you are close to whatever is vibrating and
making the **sound waves** . The farther away that the
**sound waves** spread out, the weaker they get. That
is why you can hear a friend standing right next to
you better than if they are calling to you from across
the street.

                 - Tell students that linking words are words that help to make their paragraphs
flow smoothly. Without linking words, paragraphs can read like a choppy list
of facts, making it difficult for the reader to read smoothly. Linking words
help students to connect their ideas.

first paragraph aloud while the students follow along.


- Tell students that there is an example of a linking word that helps tie

sentences and ideas together. Can someone find the word?

- Have students scan the rest of the text to find more linking words and
phrases (first, then).


- Take some time to brainstorm linking words they can use in their articles and
write them on the board or on chart paper so students can reference the list.
Words and phrases should include:


  - also  - first


  - another  - second


  - and  - then


  - but  - next


  - more  - in conclusion


  - in addition


- Tell students that as they are finishing their drafts and beginning their
revising, they should look for places where they’ve added more information
and ask themselves if they can help the reader to know that by starting the
sentence with a linking word or phrase.


- Using the Write a Research Paper-Draft from yesterday, add numbers 5 and 6
to the list, if not previously prepared.

~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 5, Lesson 15**

  - Students are likely to make the following errors


    - For ‘a_e’, students may write ‘a’


    - For ‘a’, students may write ‘a_e’


  - While either of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still

be aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find
it helpful to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the
analysis chart. For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning

consonants?


  - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


  - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization
and punctuation.


  - Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

Lesson 11: “Samuel Explains Energy to Amy and Ethan”


Unit 5 Flash, Bang, Boom!: Exploring Light and Sound
**334**


**Unit 5 | Lesson 1**
**Summary of “What Is Light?, Part 1”**





Chapter 1 reveals information about a form of energy we

see every day: light. Light moves through the world at great

speed—up to 186,000 miles per second.


Light travels in waves. These waves have many lengths. The

length of a wave determines whether or not we can see the

light. Wavelengths also affect how we see color. We see the

longest waves as red and the shortest as violet.


Some animals’ eyes are different from ours. They can see light

people can’t see with our eyes alone. Bees, for example, can

see a color called ultraviolet. There are ultraviolet patterns

on flower petals. We need special lenses to view these colors.

However, we can see red easily and bees can’t! It’s pretty

amazing that the world is full of such mysteries.


The sun is our main source of energy. That energy comes to us

as heat and light, which are created when the sun’s hydrogen

atoms are converted to helium. The energy travels through

space to Earth. The sun’s light is called white light. That means

it is made up of a combination of all the colors we can see:

red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The moon

can also look as though it gleams with white light. Actually, it

doesn’t create light of its own. It reflects the light of the sun.


We use electricity to power our own sources of light and heat.

Electricity is a type of energy. Where do you think the energy

for electricity comes from?

**Unit 5 | Lesson 6**
**All About Refraction**





You already know that light rays travel at a very fast speed.

You also know that light rays travel in straight lines. But

what happens when something gets in the way of a ray’s

movement?


Light waves can pass through many things. Some things do

not break the wave, but they change its shape. They bend it,

or change the direction in which it is moving. This is known as

refraction. When light rays bend, they look different to us.


Maybe you have seen the way someone seems to change

shape when they are in a swimming pool. Their legs may look

flat or the parts of the body that are out of the water may look

dainty. That’s because light slows down as it moves from air to

water, and the water bends rays of light.


A convex lens curves out. When light rays pass through a

convex lens, they bend in, toward the center of the lens. This

makes what you see through the lens look magnified, or

greater. Convex lenses help us see tiny details more plainly.

They also help us see things that are far away, like the faintest

stars in the night sky. Our eyes contain convex lenses. We also

use them in cameras, microscopes, and telescopes.


A concave lens curves in, toward its center. It bends the light

rays so they move away from each other. This makes what you

see through the lens look smaller. It can help the lens show a

wider array, or range, of things. When might we need to use

a concave lens? What would someone gain by making things

look smaller?

**Samuel Explains Energy to Amy**
**and Ethan**





_Tick, tick, tick, tick . . . ding!_


“Finally!” yelled Ethan. “The cake has finished baking!” Samuel

raced to put on an apron and oven mitts. As he took out the cake,

he inhaled the fragrant smell of chocolate that filled the air.


“How can you still crave cake after everything we just ate?”

asked Amy. The Thanksgiving plates were piled high on

the table. Everyone had eaten turkey, potatoes, kale salad,

stuffing, gravy, and Jack’s famous maple-glazed bacon and





carrots. Jack was snoozing in Samuel’s armchair.


“I can always make space for cake,” said Ethan.


“Same here,” said Samuel. “We’ll just have to be patient while I make the frosting.” The oven

made a vibrating sound and then whirred.


“What was that?” yelped Ethan.


“There’s a fan in the oven,” Samuel explained. “It helps cool down the oven after I turn it off.”


Amy stared through the oven window. “Does baking use energy?” she asked.


“It sure does,” said Samuel. “It takes energy to heat something up. There’s a gas flame in the

oven.”


“There’s a lot of energy in a kitchen, isn’t there?” asked Amy.


“Yes!” agreed Samuel. “You’re probably thinking about things like the oven and the microwave

and the refrigerator. Those all use energy from gas or electricity, and they release light and

heat and sound waves. But there’s also energy in things like that kale salad. Food stores energy.

When we eat the food, we get the energy to do things like walk, paint, play baseball—”


“Or eat cake,” interrupted Ethan.


“Or eat cake,” Samuel smiled.
