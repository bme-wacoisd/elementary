**The Beginning**


1. Long before you were born, in a
place we can no longer find, there was a
king. King Alfred was his name.


2. King Alfred was in charge of a
large land that stretched from the dark
forests of the north to the sea in the
south. The people of this land were very
happy with him as their king. King
Alfred liked to have fun. He liked parties
and feasts. He was fair and kind, and he
kept his people safe.


3. King Alfred could not do this all
by himself. He had twelve knights to
help him keep his lands peaceful and his
people safe. These brave knights—well,
sometimes they were brave—helped to
keep bad things from happening.


4. The most well-known knight of
all was Sir Gus the Fearless. The king
himself had given Sir Gus the name
“Fearless.” This was an odd name, for Sir
Gus was not entirely fearless. In fact, he
had a lot of fears.


5. Sir Gus was scared of the dark. He
was scared of mice and bats and spiders.
He did not like boats and he could not
swim. Shadows and loud noises made
him faint. In fact, lots of things made Sir
Gus faint.

6. Sir Gus had all the things a knight must
have. He had a shield and a lance. He had a
spear and a sword. But Sir Gus liked a long soak
in a bathtub better than a fight.


7. Cats and horses made Sir Gus itch.
Sometimes the itching was so bad that he would
start jumping up and down.


8. Sir Gus was rather absentminded. He
got lost a lot and could rarely tell which way to
go. Sir Gus found it difficult to get up in the
morning. He liked to sleep in, so he was late
most of the time.


9. All in all, Sir Gus was a rather odd
knight. But King Alfred did not see this. What
he saw was that Sir Gus always served him well.

It is exciting to start the new year—a warm welcome back to you and your child.


During the early weeks of the school year, students will review previously taught
skills. This review period will also give me, your child’s teacher, the opportunity
to get to know your child better so I can identify his or her particular areas of
strength and weakness in reading. It is important to determine exactly what level of
instruction is most appropriate for your child.


This week, your child will bring home text copies of story chapters read together in
class. I hope you will encourage your child to read the stories and discuss them with
you at home.


I will be observing and assessing your child during these first few weeks to be
sure that he or she is placed in the appropriate level of instruction. Once the
assessments are complete, your child will be placed in the instructional materials
most appropriate for his or her learning needs. You will begin to see more examples
of classwork, as well as homework, on a regular basis.


If you would like information on how you can help your child at home, please do
not hesitate to contact me. You will continue to receive periodic parent letters which
will give you tips and activities to do with your child. I look forward to teaching your
child this year.

**The Thief**


1. One dark and stormy night while King Alfred was sleeping, a thief crept into his
bedroom and stole the king’s golden ring. The next morning, when the king woke up, he saw
that his ring was gone!


2. The king was very sad.


3. “Someone stole my ring!” he cried in agony. “It was my father’s ring, and his father’s
before him. It is a king’s ring. I must have it back!”


4. King Alfred was so upset that morning that he could not eat his eels on toast.


5. King Alfred summoned his twelve brave knights. Eleven of them came at once on
horseback. Sir Gus the Fearless came later, on foot. Sir Gus explained why he was late. He
explained that he had lost his horse.


6. “Why, good sir,” said the king, “you will not get very far on foot!”


7. “Yes, my lord. I mean no, my lord,” replied Sir Gus. “The problem is, your majesty,
that when I am on my horse I itch. I had such a bad itch last night that I fell off my horse and
it ran off.”


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **7**


8. “Well, you must stop itching then,” said the king.


9. “Yes, indeed,” replied Sir Gus, trying very hard not to itch.


10. Then the king told the knights what had happened. He told them he was counting
on them to recover his ring.


11. The next day, at sunrise, eleven of the knights galloped off to find the thief.


12. Some time after lunch, Sir Gus was woken by the king himself.


13. “Not up yet?” said the king.


14. “Pardon me, my lord,” stammered Sir Gus. “I was just…”


15. “Nevermind!” said the king. “There’s no need to explain. Why should you be up at
the crack of dawn? For what can a knight do without a horse? But never fear! I have a gift for
you. You may take my horse. But you must be careful, Sir Gus. My horse is the fastest in the
land.”


16. Sir Gus got out of bed. He stretched and yawned loudly. Then he got dressed.


17. “Do not fear,” said Sir Gus, as he mounted the horse. “I am an—”


18. And with that, Sir Gus was carried off. The king’s horse had shot off like an arrow.

**All’s Well That Ends Well**


1. Sir Gus rode the king’s horse out into the country. He galloped over green land and lovely
rolling hills.


2. All was well, until he began to itch. He itched his leg. He itched his neck. He tried to itch his
back and nearly fell off the horse. Nothing seemed to help. At last Sir Gus told himself he had better
stop, lest he itch himself right off the king’s horse!


3. Sir Gus stopped in front of a farmhouse. Near the farmhouse was a stone well. Standing near the
well was a young, strong-looking man.


4. Sir Gus spoke to the young man politely. “Pardon me, good sir,” he said, “may I drink from
your well?”


5. “Yes, you may,” said the young man.


6. Sir Gus went to draw water from the well. He grabbed the rope and began to tug on it. But then
he felt the need to itch. He let go of the rope and started itching himself. Soon he was itching himself so
hard that he started jumping up
and down. He jumped up and
down so much that he fell into
the well and landed with a splash
at the bottom.


“I will help you. I will drop the bucket down. Take hold of it, and I will lift you up.”


11. Sir Gus waited nervously at the bottom of the dark well. He did not like the dark or the cold
water. His legs began to shiver and shake.


12. The bucket came down the well. Sir Gus grabbed the bucket and held on tight.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **11**


13. Slowly the young man began to bring Sir Gus up out of the well.


14. As Sir Gus reached the top of the well, the young man offered the knight his hand.


15. “Young man,” said Sir Gus, as he stepped out of the well,
“I am touched by your generous deed. I would like to thank you
for helping me. What is your name?”


16. “My name is Robin,” replied the man.


17. “Well, then, Robin,” said Sir Gus, “I thank you.”


18. “You are welcome,” said Robin.


19. The two men shook hands. Robin clasped the
knight’s hand so tightly that water dripped from his glove.


20. Robin smiled. “Come into my house,” he said. “I
will find you some dry clothing.”


21. Sir Gus went inside.


22. “Sit down,” said Robin. “I will fetch
you some dry clothing and something to drink.” Robin
left the room.


23. Sir Gus sat down on a wooden chair. As he did
so, a large black cat jumped onto his lap. At once, Sir Gus
began to itch all over. He got up and started jumping up
and down. He jumped so hard that he knocked over a
chair and bumped into a shelf.


24. Some things fell off the shelf. As he bent down to pick these things up, Sir

**The Hungry Troll**


1. King Alfred was delighted when Sir Gus gave him
his ring.


2. “How did you find it so quickly?” he asked.


3. Sir Gus shrugged and said, “It was nothing, sire—
just a bit of good luck.”


4. “I see you are not only brave and clever,” said the
king. “You are modest as well!”


5. The king slipped the ring back on his finger. Then
he had all his other knights come to a meeting.


6. “Knights,” he said, “brave Sir Gus has recovered my
ring. You may all go home.”


7. The knights rode off to their homes in the country.
They carried with them the story of Sir Gus and the king’s
ring. The story was told far and wide. Sir Gus became a
very famous knight.


8. For a long time, all was well. Each day the king
would hunt, fish, and eat. Each night he slept peacefully in
his bed.


9. Months passed. Then one snowy winter morning,
there came the sound of thunder. Except it was not
thunder. It was the thunderous cry of a troll.


10. The troll had woken from a long sleep. It was very
hungry. A troll is a monstrous beast. It will eat a lot of
things, but it is very fond of people.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **17**


11. King Alfred was frightened. He woke up when the
troll cried out. He feared for the safety of his kingdom. He
sent for his knights.


12. At once, eleven brave knights came. They too were
woken by the loud cry of the troll.


13. However, Sir Gus the Fearless did not come. The cries
of the troll had not woken him. He was still tucked up in bed
snoring. At last, the king could wait no longer. He sent one of
the other knights to fetch Sir Gus.


14. Sometime after lunch, Sir Gus came. He was tired
and hungry. He had a bad cold. His nose was swollen and red.


15. “What kept you?” asked the king. “Did you not hear
the sound of the troll?”


16. “ _Doe_, your _dajesty_,” said Sir Gus, “I did _dot_ . I have a
_dold_ in my _doze_,” replied Sir Gus.


17. “Well it must have stopped up your ears, too!” said
the king. “Hear me, knights! I am concerned. We must do
something to stop this monstrous troll! We must keep this
loathsome beast from eating all of the people in my kingdom!
Who has a plan?”


18. “If I may, your majesty,” said the knight known as Sir
Tom, “I know that trolls are scared of fire. We could make a
fire near the troll’s home and scare it.”


19. “I like it!” said the king. “See that it is done!”


20. Eleven of the knights went to get torches. Then they
rode off to find the troll.


21. Sir Gus, however, did not ride off at once. He crept
into the king’s kitchen and helped himself to a big slice of pie.

**Fire!**


1. It was not hard to find the troll. Trolls cry when they are
hungry. The knights simply followed the sound of loud sobs and
eating.


2. As nightfall neared, the knights arrived at the foot of a
large hill. The troll had spent all day eating the rocks and plants
on the hill. All that was left on the hill were some prickly plants
and some old, dying trees.


3. Near the top of the hill was a cave. Scary troll sounds
were coming from inside the cave.


4. The knights met in a grove at the foot of the hill. They
knelt down and made a plan.


5. “When it is dark we will light our torches,” said Sir
Tom. “Then we will creep up the hill. The sight of the flames
will scare the troll and it will go back to its home beneath the
ground.”


6. “And what if that plan fails?” asked Sir Ed. “I don’t care
to be the troll’s dinner.”


7. “Well, do you have a better plan?” asked Sir Tom.


8. Sir Ed said nothing. The other knights were quiet, as
well.


9. At that very moment came the sound of a horse trotting
nearby.


10. “Found you at last!” said Sir Gus as he rode up to the
knights. “So, my fellow knights, tell me, have you devised a plan
of attack to defeat this monstrous troll?”


11. “Yes, we have!” said Sir Tom. “We have agreed that our
bravest knight will creep up the hill with a torch and frighten the
troll away.”


12. “Splendid idea!” said Sir Gus. “And who is going to
attempt this brave deed?” he asked, looking around.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **21**


13. “You!” said Sir Tom and Sir Ed together.


14. “But, but… well… I… er… um…,” said a reluctant Sir Gus.


15. It was no good trying to get out of it. Sir Tom handed Sir Gus a lit torch. Then he pointed at
the cave.


16. Sir Gus went up the hill alone. By the time he reached the mouth of the cave, it was pitch
black. The lit torch cast shadows on the ground.


17. Sir Gus looked around him. He saw shadows dancing on the ground. He was afraid. But he
pressed on.


18. From inside the cave came alarming troll sounds.


19. “Snnniccck, Snnnuummm, Guffumffffff!”


20. The troll was eating bits of rock with its sharp teeth, then spitting out the bits it did not like.


21. Sir Gus approached the cave. Small pieces of rock came flying out. Some of them landed at
Sir Gus’s feet. Sir Gus jumped back, trying to avoid the flying pieces of rock.


22. Suddenly there was a thumping sound. Thump! Thump! Thump! The troll was coming out
of the cave!

Joe and Pete were best pals. One night, Pete slept over at Joe’s house.


The kids stayed up late to see a scary TV show. When the show ended at
midnight, they made their way upstairs to bed.


Joe tossed Pete a pillow. Then, he flipped off the light switch.


The kids were lying quietly in the dark.


Just then, there was a sound. It was a long, low, moaning sound.


“Am I crazy,” Pete said, “or did I just hear moaning?”


“You’re not crazy,” said Joe.


“Was it you who moaned?” Pete asked.


“No,” said Joe.


“Then who was it?”


“Beats me,” said Joe.

By this point, both kids were scared.

“Should we go and have a look?” said Pete.


“No way!” said Joe.


Just then, the moaning started again.


“Don’t freak out!” said Pete. “Stay cool!”


The moaning stopped. Then, a hoarse voice said, “Whooo—watch out Joe
and Pete! Here we come.”


That was when Joe and Pete lost their cool. They jumped up and screamed,
“No! Don’t hurt us! We’re just kids!”


Then, Joe’s sisters, Jean and Mary, jumped out of the closet.

**Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp,**
**Part I**

There once was a poor boy whose name was Aladdin. His father was a tailor.
When his father died, Aladdin’s mother had to work to earn a living.

One day, a stranger greeted Aladdin.

“Tell me, son,” said the stranger. “Are you the son of the tailor?”

“Yes,” said Aladdin.

The stranger threw his arms around him. “My dear nephew!” he cried. “Your
father was my brother! Now I learn he is dead! What a shame!”

Aladdin took the man to his mother. She was surprised. Her husband had never
spoken of a brother. Even so, she greeted the man kindly. When he promised to help
Aladdin become a merchant, she believed him.

But the stranger was not Aladdin’s uncle. He was a magician from faraway north
Africa. He had come to Persia in search of a magic lamp. It was said that this lamp
would make a man rich. To find the lamp, the magician needed a helper. He was
looking for someone who would help without asking any questions. He thought
Aladdin was just the right person.

The next day, the magician came to get Aladdin.

“Come with me,” he said. “I will introduce you to other merchants.” Then, he
led the boy out into the country.

The magician led Aladdin up a steep mountain. They climbed for an hour.
Then, they came to a spot where no flowers grew.

“Get some sticks,” said the magician. “We will make a fire. Then, I will show
you something amazing.”

Aladdin did as he was told. The magician lit the fire. Then, he threw perfumes
into it and chanted magical words. The sky darkened. Thunder rumbled. The earth
opened at their feet. There before them was a large stone with a brass ring attached.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **61**


“Under this stone is a treasure,” said the magician. “It will make you richer than
any king. Lift the stone by the ring. Then, go down the stairs. You will pass many
treasures, but you must not touch them. You will enter a garden. There you will
see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp to me. Once you have it, you may
gather any of the treasures that you see.”

Aladdin was amazed. He could not believe what he was being asked to do. But
he agreed.

“Take this ring,” said the magician. “It will keep you safe from harm.” Aladdin
took it and placed it on his finger.

Aladdin lifted the stone. He went down the stairs. He made his way through
a hallway of treasures. He was careful not to touch anything. When he found the
lamp, he tucked it inside his bag. Then, he filled his pockets with all the glittering
things he saw. He didn’t know they were precious gems. He was thinking, “I will
gather these pretty things to play with at home.”

All those gems weighed Aladdin down. When he came to the top of the
staircase, he could not climb out. “Give me a hand, Uncle,” he cried.

“First, give me the lamp,” the magician answered.

The lamp was buried in the bag Aladdin was carrying.

“I cannot reach it now,” Aladdin said.

“Hand it up to me,” said the magician.

“But I can’t!” Aladdin said.

The magician grew angry. “The lamp!” he cried, for that was all he cared about.

But Aladdin did not want to drop anything. “I will give it to you when I get
out,” he said.

The impatient magician felt he could wait no longer. He chanted a magic spell. The
stone rolled back, trapping Aladdin in the black darkness of the cave.

**The Dog Show**

During summer vacation, Jill and Rachel went to the Seattle Dog Show.

It was Rachel’s first time at a dog show, so her pal Jill explained things to her.

“That section over there is the show ring,” she explained. “That’s where the
action is. The handlers lead the dogs into the ring one at a time. Each handler leads
the dog over to the far side. Then, he turns the dog and leads it back.”

The first handler was a girl in a tweed skirt and jacket. She was leading a dog
with thick, puffy fur. The girl was jogging. The dog was trotting at her side.

“What sort of dog is that?” Rachel asked.

“That’s a chow chow,” said Jill. “It’s a Chinese breed.”

“Aw!” said Rachel. “He’s so cute! I like his fur.”

The next dog was smaller and closer to the ground. He had a long body and
four, short, little legs.

“What breed is that?” Rachel asked.

“That’s a basset hound,” said Jill. “They were bred to be hunting dogs. They are
short and low to the ground so they can chase foxes.”

The next dog was bigger. It had golden fur, pointy ears, and a face like a fox.

“That’s a Finnish spitz!” said Jill.

“Ooooo!” said Rachel. “I like her, too!”

Next came a pug. It was a short, strong-looking dog with lots of wrinkles on his
face.

“He’s so ugly that he’s cute!” Rachel said. “I like him!”

“He might win,” said Jill. “He came in third last year.”

“How can they choose only one winner?” Rachel asked. “All of the dogs are so
cute! I could never pick just one!”


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **63**


“It’s not easy,” said Jill.

“It’s not like they are all the same breed,” Rachel said. “I see how you could pick
the best of ten beagles. But how can you say this spitz is better than that beagle?”

Jill explained, “They are looking for the dog that is the best example of its breed.
There are lots of traits for each breed. They look at the legs, the paws, and the teeth.
The ears need to look right. The fur needs to be just right. Lots of things have to be
right to win Best in Show.”

**Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, Part II**

Aladdin was trapped in the cave.

“Uncle!” he called. “Help me!” But there was no reply. The magician had
whisked himself back to north Africa. All he wanted was the lamp. If Aladdin would
not help him get that, he cared nothing for Aladdin.

For three days, Aladdin stayed in the pitch-black cave. At first, he shouted.
Then, he wept. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. As he did so, he happened
to rub the ring that the magician had placed on his finger. A genie rose before him.

“What is your wish?” said the genie of the ring.

Aladdin was scared but he managed to say, “Take me out of this cave!”

Poof!

Aladdin found himself outside again.

He ran home to tell his mother all that had happened. He showed her the gems,
which she thought were just pretty things as well. Then, he showed her the lamp.

“It is so dirty,” said Aladdin’s mother. “Let me clean it. Then, perhaps I can sell
it and get us some food.”

She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. Suddenly, a monstrous genie
appeared. This genie was far bigger than the one that had appeared to Aladdin
before.

“What is your wish?” thundered the genie of the lamp.

The poor woman almost fainted with fear. Aladdin said, “We are hungry! Get us
something to eat!”

Poof!

The genie returned with twelve gold platters piled high with food. Aladdin and
his mother ate their fill. Then, they sold the gold platters and bought more food.

One day at the market, Aladdin caught a glimpse of the Sultan’s daughter. She
was so beautiful that he fell in love at once. He told his mother that he wanted to
marry the princess.

Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **73**


Aladdin’s mother laughed. “Have you lost your senses?” she said. “Your father
was a poor tailor!”

“Remember the glittering things from the cave?” said Aladdin. “Take them and
offer them as a gift to the Sultan.”

Aladdin’s mother went to the Sultan. “My lord,” she said. “My son Aladdin
wishes to marry your daughter.”

The Sultan burst out laughing. “Your son and my daughter?” he boomed. “Ha!”

Aladdin’s mother opened her cloth and displayed the gems.

The Sultan fell silent. He stepped forward to look closely at what he saw. He
realized that they were not just pretty, glittering things.

“These are astounding!” the Sultan thought. “I have never seen such radiant
gems!”

The Sultan spoke again: “Your son may marry my daughter—on one condition.
He must send forty servants, each carrying a bowl of gems like these.”

When Aladdin heard this, he rubbed his lamp. The genie appeared. Aladdin
repeated the Sultan’s wish. Almost instantly, the genie returned with forty servants.
Each servant carried a large golden bowl. Half of the bowls were filled with pearls
and diamonds; the others were filled with rubies and emeralds.

The Sultan was amazed. He agreed that Aladdin could marry his daughter.

Aladdin was delighted. He rubbed the lamp. The genie appeared.

Aladdin commanded the genie to prepare a wedding fit for a prince. The forty
servants appeared again. They brought Aladdin rich clothes and sweet perfumes.
They gave him a beautiful horse, which he rode to the wedding. They threw gold
pieces to the people who lined the streets to see him. They made Aladdin a palace
right next to the Sultan’s palace. They even rolled out a thick, red carpet for the
princess; it stretched from the Sultan’s home to Aladdin’s palace. When the Sultan
saw Aladdin’s palace, he was sure that Aladdin was the right husband for his
daughter. They celebrated their wedding with a feast and music. The party lasted all
day and all night.

**Black Diamond**

My cousin Phil has more courage than sense. Last winter, we went skiing.
Phil and I were just learning to ski. We had taken four lessons. Then, Phil started
thinking that he was hot stuff. He thought he was ready to ski the toughest trails. I
tried to tell him he was not ready, but he would not listen.

One frosty day, we were standing at the top of the mountain. There was a sign
that said, “Great Gorge.” There was a big black diamond next to the words “Great
Gorge.” A second sign said, “Caution! Black Diamond Trails are for Advanced Skiers
Only!”

Phil said, “I think I’ll ski Great Gorge!”

“Are you nuts?” I asked. “You’re not ready for black diamond trails.”

“Sure I am!” said Phil. “I’ve totally got the hang of this! Want to ski it with me?”

“No way!” I said, shaking my head.

“Oh, well!” Phil said. “Enjoy the easy trail!”

Phil slid up to the edge. Then, he gave a push with his ski poles.

“See you at the bottom of the mountain!” he called, as he slid off.

Phil went shooting down the mountain. The trail was very steep. I saw him
swerve to the left to avoid a big boulder. I watched him weave back and forth,
dodging other skiers. Then, he went over a ridge. I could not see him anymore.

I skied down the mountain on an easier trail. Halfway down, I saw a friend from
school.

“Hey Clyde!” I yelled. “Have you seen Phil?”

“Yeah!” Clyde said. “He flew past a couple of minutes ago. He was really
moving!”

I skied on until I got to the bottom. I searched for Phil everywhere, but I
could not find him. I was starting to get worried when I saw a man pull up in

Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **75**


a snowmobile. He was a member of the ski patrol. He was towing a round sled.
There, on the sled, lay Phil. He was groaning.

“Is he okay?” I asked the man.

“He’s banged up, but OK,” said the ski patrol guy. “Tell him to stay off the black
diamond trails. He took a pretty bad fall back there. It looks like he bruised his
knee. It could have been a lot worse! He could have broken his leg!”

Her father replied that she could do what she liked with him.

**Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, Part III**


Aladdin was delighted with his new life. He felt that everything was perfect. But
danger lurked.

The magician heard of Aladdin’s good fortune. “That lazy boy?” he said.
“Married to the Sultan’s daughter? Surely this must be the magic of the lamp.”

He whisked himself back to Persia. He dressed as a poor peddler and carried a
few shiny lamps in a basket. As he walked by Aladdin’s palace, he shouted, “New
lamps for old!”

Aladdin was out hunting. His wife, the princess, heard the voice from the street.

“We have that ugly, old lamp,” she thought. “I would gladly trade it for a shiny,
new one.”

She handed Aladdin’s lamp to the magician. He handed her a new lamp.

The magician hurried away and later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The genie
appeared.

“Take Aladdin’s palace and all that it contains,” commanded the magician. “Set
it down in my home of north Africa.”

“I hear and I obey,” said the genie of the lamp.

The next morning, the Sultan looked out the window. His daughter’s palace was
gone. So was the princess. He sent his soldiers out and they dragged Aladdin before
the Sultan.

“Find my daughter!” he stormed. “If you fail, you die!”

Poor Aladdin wandered far from the city. He walked beside a river and rubbed his
hands, wondering what to do.

The genie of the ring appeared once more.

“What do you wish?” asked the genie of the ring.

“Bring my palace and my beloved wife home to me,” begged Aladdin.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **87**


“Sadly,” said the genie, “I cannot. That duty belongs only to the genie of the
lamp.”

“Then, take me to be with my wife.”

Poof!

Aladdin found himself in Africa. His wife greeted him joyfully. She told him
about the peddler and the lamp. When Aladdin heard this, he knew that the
magician had used the lamp to work his evil deed. He and his wife made a plan to
get the lamp back.

The next day, the princess cooked the magician a fine supper. Aladdin kept out
of sight. She slipped poison into the magician’s cup. One sip was all it took. The
magician fell on the floor, dead.

Aladdin ran in and found the lamp. The magician had hidden it in his sleeve.
Aladdin rubbed the lamp. The monstrous genie appeared.

“What do you wish?” the genie of the lamp thundered.

“Take this palace, with all it contains,” commanded Aladdin. “Carry it to Persia
and set it down beside the Sultan’s home.”

“I hear and I obey,” replied the genie of the lamp.

The palace was lifted up into the air.

The next morning, the Sultan arose and looked out the window. He was very
happy to see his daughter and her palace once again. He ordered a month of
celebrations.

From then on, Aladdin lived with the princess in peace, happiness, and safety.
When the old Sultan died, Aladdin took his throne. He ruled justly over all people,
rich and poor.

**Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Part I**
_In 1865, the English author Lewis Carroll introduced the world to a girl named Alice_
_and the strange and funny world of Wonderland._


Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank of the
river with nothing to do. Once or twice, she had peeked into the book her sister was
reading. But the book had no pictures or conversations in it.

“What is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”

It was a hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She was thinking if the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies. Just then, a White Rabbit ran past her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very
peculiar to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” But
when the Rabbit took a watch out of its pocket, Alice jumped to her feet. She ran
after the Rabbit and saw him pop down a large rabbit hole.

Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole, never once thinking how she would
get out again. The rabbit hole dipped suddenly down. Alice found herself falling
down what seemed to be a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of
time to look about her. She looked at the sides of the well. They were filled with
cupboards and bookshelves.

“Well!” thought Alice to herself. “After a fall like this, I shall think nothing of
tumbling down the stairs!”

Down, down, down. Would the fall ever come to an end?

“I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time.” Alice said aloud. “I must
be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down, I think. I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How
funny it will be to come out among the people that walk with their heads pointing
downwards! I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is. ‘Please,


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **113**


Ma’am, is this New Zealand? Or Australia?’” She felt that she was dozing off when
suddenly, thump! Down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves.

Alice was not hurt. She got up and looked around. Before her was a long tunnel.
The White Rabbit was hurrying down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say,
“Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She thought she was catching up
to the White Rabbit. Then, she turned the corner and, poof! He was gone.

Alice found herself in a long, low hall. There were many doors, but they were all
locked. She wondered how she would ever get out.

Suddenly, she came upon a little three-legged table. It was made of solid glass.
There was nothing on it but a tiny, golden key. But, it would not open any of the
doors.

Then, Alice spotted a curtain she had not noticed before. Behind it was a little
door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little, golden key in the lock. It fit!

The door led into a small tunnel. It was not much larger than a rat hole. Alice
knelt down and looked out into the loveliest garden she had ever seen. She longed to
get out of that dark hall. She longed to wander about the garden. But the doorway
was tiny. She could not even get her head through it.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so Alice went back to the
table. This time, she found a little bottle on it.

“Hmm,” said Alice. “That was not there before.”

Alice looked closely at the bottle. The label said, ‘DRINK ME.’

“I’ll look first,” Alice said, “to see if it’s marked Poison.”

The bottle was not marked Poison so Alice decided to taste it. She found it had
a sort of mixed flavor. It tasted like cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey,
toffee, and hot buttered toast. Alice drank it up.

**Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Part II**
_When last we saw Alice, she had decided to drink from a little bottle. The contents of the_
_bottle tasted rather odd._


“What a curious feeling!” said Alice. She was shrinking smaller and smaller. Soon, she
was only ten inches high. That was just the right size to fit through the little door that led to
the garden. But, when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little, golden key.
She went back to the table for it, but she was too short to reach it.

Alice sat down and cried, but soon her eye fell on a little, glass box that was under the
table. She opened it and found a very small cake. The words ‘EAT ME’ were spelled out on
the cake with currants.

“I’ll eat it,” said Alice enthusiastically.

“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice. “Now, I’m growing larger and larger! Goodbye,
feet!”

Alice’s head bumped against the roof of the hall. She was nine feet tall. She grabbed the
little, golden key and ran to the garden door.

But, she was now too large to go through the doorway! All she could do was peek into
the garden with one eye.

Alice sat down and began to cry again. She went on, crying gallons of tears, until there
was a large pool around her.

Then, Alice heard a pattering of feet in the distance. It was the White Rabbit returning.
He was splendidly dressed, with a pair of white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
other. He was muttering to himself, “Oh, The Duchess! Won’t she be cross if I’ve kept her
waiting!”

When the Rabbit came near her, Alice tried to speak to him.

“If you please, sir—”

The Rabbit was startled. He dropped his gloves and his fan and scurried away into the
darkness.

“How odd everything is today!” said Alice.

As she said this, Alice could see that she was shrinking again. In another moment, splash!
She was up to her chin in water. Poor Alice was swimming in a pool of her own tears.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **123**


“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice as she swam about in search of a way out.
Thankfully, Alice did find a way out. She was not one for sitting still doing nothing, so she
began to wander further and further into Wonderland.

It was at that point that she came upon a large, blue Caterpillar. The Caterpillar was
sitting on a mushroom and smoking a pipe.

Alice stood on her tiptoes and peeked over the edge of the mushroom. Her eyes met
those of the Caterpillar. The two of them looked at each other for some time in silence. At
last, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of its mouth and asked, “Who are you?”

Alice replied, “I—I hardly know, sir. I know who I was when I got up this morning, but
I have been changed several times since then.”

“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!”

“I can’t explain myself, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m not myself, you see.”

“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.

“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied. “I find that being so many different
sizes in one day is very confusing.”

“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.

Alice felt a little irritated by the Caterpillar and she turned away.

“Come back!” the Caterpillar called. “I’ve something important to say!”

This sounded promising, so Alice turned and came back again.

“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.

“Is that all?” said Alice.

In a minute or two, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and got down off the
mushroom. Then, he crawled away into the grass. As he went, he said, “One side will make
you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.”

“One side of what?” thought Alice to herself.

“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar.

In another moment, the Caterpillar was gone.

Alice broke off a bit of each side of the mushroom. She ate small bites and managed to
bring herself back to her normal height.

**Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Part III**
_Next, Alice wandered until she came upon a Cheshire Cat. The Cat was sitting on the_
_branch of a tree and grinning from ear to ear. Alice was beginning to wish her time in_
_Wonderland would come to an end._


“Cheshire Cat,” Alice said, “would you tell me, please, which way I should walk from
here?”

“That depends a lot on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.

“I don’t care much where—” said Alice.

“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.

“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added.

“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

Alice tried another question, “What sort of people live here?”

“In that direction,” said the Cat, waving his right paw, “lives a Mad Hatter. In that
direction lives a March Hare. Visit either of them if you like: they’re both mad.”

“But I don’t want to visit with mad people,” Alice remarked.

“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat. “We’re all mad here.”

Then, the Cat vanished slowly, beginning at the end of his tail and ending with his grin,
which remained some time after the rest of him had gone.

“Well!” thought Alice. “A grin without a cat! How curious!”

She walked a bit and came to a house with a table set up in front. The March Hare and
the Mad Hatter were having tea. A Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep. The
table was large but the three of them were all crowded together at one corner of it.

“No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming.

“There’s plenty of room!” said Alice indignantly. She sat down in a large armchair at one
end of the table.

“Have some lemonade,” said the March Hare.

Alice looked all around the table.

“I don’t see any lemonade,” she remarked.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **139**


“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.

“Then, it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.

“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the March Hare.

The Mad Hatter looked at Alice for some time. At last, he said, “Why is a raven like a
writing desk?”

“A riddle!” thought Alice. “We shall have some fun now!”

“I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.

“Do you mean that you think you know the answer to it?” asked the March Hare.

“Exactly so,” said Alice.

“Then, you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.

“I do,” Alice replied. “At least, I mean what I say—that’s the same thing, you know.”

“Not the same thing at all!” said the Mad Hatter. “Why, you might as well say that ‘I see
what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see!’”

“You might as well say,” added the Dormouse, which seemed to be walking and talking
in its sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing as ‘I sleep when I breathe!’”

“It is the same thing with you,” said the Mad Hatter. Then, he turned to Alice again and
asked, “Have you guessed the riddle yet?”

“No, I give up,” Alice replied. “What’s the answer?”

“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Mad Hatter.

“Nor I,” said the March Hare.

“Well,” thought Alice, “this is the strangest tea party I ever was at in all my life!”

Alice stayed for a while longer and listened to the Dormouse tell a story about three
sisters who lived at the bottom of a treacle well. The story was very odd indeed. Alice,
confused by the tale, frequently questioned the Dormouse. At last, a frustrated Alice walked
off.

“It’s the strangest tea party I ever was at in all my life!” Alice concluded.

**Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Part IV**
_In this final chapter, Alice comes across even more odd things in Wonderland._


As Alice wandered further into Wonderland, she found a door in a tree that led
into a hallway. The hallway led into the beautiful garden that she had been in earlier.
Remarkably, upon entering the garden, she met a huge number of people, including
royal courtiers and royal children, as well as the King and Queen of Hearts. They
were about to begin a game of croquet and they invited Alice to play.

The game itself proved to be nothing but chaos, partly because the croquet
ground was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls were live hedgehogs and the
mallets were flamingos. Alice found that her biggest problem was managing her
flamingo and stopping the balls—or hedgehogs—from walking away. In addition,
the players all played at the same time without waiting for their turn. The Queen,
for her part, began stamping about and shouting, “Off with his head!” or “Off with
her head!”

But lucky for Alice, she was removed from the game by none other than the
Queen who was eager for Alice to meet the Mock Turtle. On their way to meet the
Mock Turtle, Alice was introduced to the Gryphon. What are a Mock Turtle and
a Gryphon? Alice did not know either; nor did she ever get an answer that made
sense. The best answer is that they are two more examples of the extraordinary
inhabitants of Wonderland.

Together the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told the Queen and Alice stories of
their school days. They recalled the subjects they had studied in school, including
Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition, not to mention ancient and modern Mystery.
Alice was quite certain that she had not yet studied these subjects.

This odd conversation was stopped by the news that an important trial had
begun. Alice raced off with the Gryphon to discover that the Knave of Hearts was
on trial for stealing some tarts.

Just like the game of croquet, the trial itself was a confusing mess. The witnesses
were not at all helpful. Quite strangely, Alice herself was called as a witness. When


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **147**


the Queen said that the sentence should be announced before the jury had decided
upon their verdict, Alice was ready to scream. In fact, she did.

“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the sentence first!”

“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.

“I won’t!” said Alice.

“Off with her head!” yelled the Queen.

Again, lucky for Alice, just at that moment she woke up on the river bank beside
her sister. The sun was still shining and it was indeed a beautiful day. Alice eagerly
told her sister all about her dream and her adventures in Wonderland. Alice’s sister
was quite entertained by the stories of Wonderland and the way in which Alice told
them. Alice’s eyes twinkled and shone as she told her sister about the Caterpillar, the
Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the King and Queen of Hearts, not
to mention the White Rabbit.

As Alice skipped away to enjoy some afternoon tea, her sister imagined this
magical world full of curious creatures. Alice’s sister hoped that Alice would always
remember the day that she dreamed of Wonderland and continue to tell the stories.
