ASSESSMENT
### **A.1**

###### **End-of-Year Silent Reading Assessment** **The Cat**



Once upon a time in Denmark, there was a man named Franz. Franz lived
a good life all year long, until one night. That evening, a pack of horrible, badly
behaved trolls descended on him. The trolls drove poor Franz from his house and
took over the place.

This went on for many years on the exact same night every year, until, one
year, a famous hunter visited the house the morning of the dreaded night. The
hunter had just captured a large, white bear and planned to present it to the King of
Denmark. The hunter had a long journey ahead of him and asked Franz if he and
the bear could spend the night.

“I would let you stay,” said Franz, “but I can’t, for every year at this time I am
visited by trolls at night who drive me out of the house. They will be here tonight
and you do not want to be here when they arrive!”

“Oh,” said the hunter, “I am not afraid of trolls. If that is all you are worried
about, let me stay in the house. The bear can sleep under the stove there. I will sleep
in the back, in the comfortable bedroom.”

“Very well,” said Franz. “You may stay, at your own risk, but I must get the
house ready for the trolls. If I don’t, they will be furious.”

Franz worked diligently to get his house ready for the trolls. He chopped wood
and built a fire. He set the table with his best dishes and loaded them with porridge,
assorted fruit, smoked fish, and delicious sausages. When he was done, he left the
hunter and the bear in the house and went to stay with a friend.

At sunset, the trolls arrived. They stormed into the house and began a raucous
celebration. They ate and drank, sang songs, and made a terrible mess.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 10** **33**


One of the trolls caught a glimpse of the bear. It was lying under the stove, with
only an ear sticking out.

“Look!” the troll said, “Franz has a cat!”

The troll cut off a bit of sausage and tossed it on the floor. Then, he kicked the
bear in the ear and shouted, “Wake up, kitty! Get the sausage!”

The bear rose up on its hind legs, ripping the stove away from the floor. The
stove was launched across the room. The bear, in a great fury, roared ferociously.
The trolls were terrified. They screamed and ran for their lives.

Franz returned home the next day. He cleaned up the horrific mess the trolls
had made, repaired the stove, and lived another year in his house. When the
dreaded evening arrived once again the next year, he expected the trolls to come
again. He went out into the yard to cut wood for them.

After a few minutes, he heard a voice calling, “Franz! Franz!”

Franz squinted into the woods but saw nothing but trees.

Then, he heard the voice again say, “Franz! Franz!”

“Yes?” Franz said. “What is it?”

“Have you still got that huge, ferocious cat?” the voice asked.

Franz thought for a minute. Then, he replied.

“Yes,” Franz said. “I still have the cat. It is lying under the stove, and, earlier this
year, it had seven kittens. Now, all of the kittens have grown up. They are bigger
and fiercer than their mother!”

“Egad!” said the voice. “Then, you will never see us again!”

Franz heard a rustling of feet in the woods. Then, there was silence.

After that, Franz went on with his life and the trolls never bothered him again.

###### **Invasive Species**

In today’s world, people are on the move. Salesmen jet from one city to another.
Tourists visit foreign countries. Immigrants leave their homes and settle in new lands.

But did you know that animals are also on the move? Sometimes people bring
exotic animals back from their trips. Sometimes, they buy exotic animals in pet
shops. Other times, the animals travel by themselves. They may sneak into crates
that are shipped from one country to another or they may find their way onto ships
that cross the oceans.

This animal travel has caused some problems. Sometimes animals end up in a
new place which is just right for them. The land is just right for them. The climate
is perfect. There is lots of food. This is a good thing for them. But it may be a bad
thing for other animals in the ecosystem. The newly arrived animals may settle in
and have babies. They may disrupt the ecosystem by eating up or crowding out
the native animals. When this happens, we say the ecosystem has a problem with
“invasive species.” The ecosystem is being invaded by outsiders.

There are invasive species in many parts of the United States. In Florida, the
invasive species that people are most worried about these days is the Burmese
python. Burmese pythons are snakes that are native to Asia. They are big snakes. An
average Burmese python is twelve feet long.

Burmese pythons like to live near water, but they can also slither up into trees.
These snakes are carnivores. They eat small mammals like rats and mice. They also
eat birds. The Burmese python is a constrictor. It bites its victim and holds it. Then,
it wraps itself around the victim and squeezes it to death. Once the victim is dead,
the snake swallows it whole.

So how did these Burmese pythons make their way to Florida? Some people
like to keep snakes as pets. For a long time, you could buy a Burmese python for
about twenty dollars. You could feed it mice and watch it grow. There was only one
problem: the snake might eventually get too big for its cage. Experts think some
pet owners set their snakes free when they got too big. Some pythons may also have
escaped when a hurricane hit Florida in 1996.

**DATE:**


In any case, thousands of Burmese pythons now make their home in the
swamps of southern Florida. This part of Florida is warm, wet, and full of small
mammals. At least, it used to be full of small mammals. A 2011 study found that
lots of small mammals in these areas are in trouble. The pythons are gobbling up
raccoons, rabbits, and opossums. They are even eating larger animals, including
deer, bobcats, and alligators!

Experts are worried. They are afraid that the pythons may wipe out some of the
endangered species that live in the area. A new law has made it illegal for pet shops
in the United States to sell Burmese pythons. Another law has allowed hunters to
hunt pythons. Officials are hoping these laws will help keep the python problem
under control.

In the Midwest, people are worried about Asian carp. Asian carp are fish that
are native to Asia. Some of them were brought to the United States in the 1970s.
They got loose in the Mississippi River. Now, they are spreading like wildfire. The
carp are not just in the Mississippi River. They have also been found in other rivers
that feed into the Mississippi. People are worried that they may get into the Great
Lakes.

Asian carp are big eaters. They gobble up food that other fish need. The carp
get so big that other fish can’t eat them. So, the arrival of Asian carp is bad news for
other fish.

Asian carp are dangerous in another way, too. They are amazing jumpers. An
Asian carp can jump eight to ten feet in the air.

Asian carp tend to be scared by boats. If you drive a motorboat past them, they
may start to jump out of the water. You may see hundreds of flying fish. You may
even be hit with a fish. A number of people have been injured by these jumping
fish.

Invasive species, like the Burmese python and Asian carp, can harm
environments they invade. Animals and plants suffer and some of the damage
caused by these invasive species may be permanent.

### A.5 [ASSESSMENT]

**DATE:**

###### **End-of-Year Fluency Assessment** **The Elephant and the Ape**


“Look at me!” cried Tusk the elephant. “See how big and strong I am!” 14

“Look at me!” cried his friend Nim the ape. “See how quick and clever I am!” 30

“It is better to be big and strong than quick and clever!” said Tusk. 44

“Not so,” answered Nim. “It is better to be quick and clever than big and strong.” 60

So the two friends began to argue. 67

“Let’s not argue,” said Nim. “Let’s go to Sage and ask him to settle the matter.” 83

“Agreed!” said Tusk and off they ran. 90

Sage was a wise old owl who lived in the darkest corner of an old tower. 106

Sage listened to what Tusk and Nim had to say. 116

“I see,” he said. “There is way to settle this. You must do just as I say. Then, I 136
shall tell you which is better.” 141

“Agreed!” said Tusk. 144

“Agreed!” said Nim. 147

“Cross the river,” said Sage, “and pick me some of the mangoes that grow on the 163
great tree.” 165

Tusk and Nim set off on their mission. 173

Soon, they came to the river, which was very wide and deep. Nim was afraid. 188

“I can’t cross that river!” he cried. “Let’s go back.” 198

Tusk laughed. “Didn’t I tell you it is better to be big and strong than to be quick 217
and clever? It is an easy thing for me to cross the river.” 229

Tusk lifted Nim up with his trunk and put him on his broad back. Then, he 246
swam across the river. 249


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 10** **65**


Soon, they came to the mango tree. It was so tall that Tusk could not reach 265
the mangoes, even with his long trunk. He tried to knock the tree over but could 281
not do it. 284

“I can’t reach the mangoes,” he said. “The tree is too high. We shall have to 300
go back without the mangoes.” 305

Nim laughed. “Didn’t I tell you it is better to be quick and clever than big 321
and strong? It is an easy thing for me to climb this tree.” 334

Nim scampered up the tree and tossed down a whole basketful of ripe 347
mangoes. Tusk picked them up. Then, the two of them the crossed the river as 362
before. 363

When they came again to Sage’s tower, Tusk said, “Here are your mangoes. 376
Now tell us which is better—to be big and strong or to be quick and clever?” 393

Sage answered, “I should think you would know that yourself. You crossed 405
the river, and Nim gathered the fruit. Sometimes it is better to be big and strong 421
and sometimes it is better to be quick and clever. Each thing in its place is best.” 438

“That is true,” answered Tusk. 443

“Indeed it is,” said Nim. 448

Then, away they went, and from that day on, they were better friends than 462
ever before. 464
