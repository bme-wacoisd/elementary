**Chapter**
#### **What Is Light?**
## **1**

Did you know that the sun is the greatest **source**
of light for our planet, Earth? But what is light?
Why is it so important?

Hot gases of the sun give off both light and heat.
Light carries **energy**, with the long **wavelengths**
carrying the least and the short **wavelengths** carrying
the most. When you think of something with lots of
**energy**, what comes to mind?

Do you think of something fast like a race car?
Do you think of something with great force like a
very strong wind knocking down a tree?

Believe it or not, light can be many times more
energetic than a car or the wind.



2


_The sun is the greatest_ _**source**_ _of light for Earth._



3


Light travels at 186,000 miles every second in a
**vacuum** . At that **speed**, light can go around Earth
more than seven times every second! No humanmade machine can go that fast—not even a jet plane
or rocket!

One way that light travels, including light from
the sun, is in the form of **waves** . Scientists can
measure how long light **waves** are. **Waves** can be
different sizes—some are long and some are short.
Some light **waves** are visible and some are invisible.
Whether you can see light or not depends on
the length of the **wave** . The longest **wavelength**
of visible light is seen as red and the shortest
**wavelength** is violet. Short **wavelengths** carry the
most **energy** .

Long **Wavelengths** Short **Wavelengths**


_One way light from the sun travels is in_ _**waves**_ _._ _**Waves**_ _can be different sizes._
_Short_ _**wavelengths**_ _, like those at the far right, carry the most_ _**energy**_ _._


5


The sun gives off what is called **white light** .
Perhaps you think of the light from the sun as
having no color at all. Maybe you think the light
from the sun is more yellow in color. It may surprise
you to know that the sun’s light, **white light**, is
made up of all the colors of the rainbow. **White**
**light** includes light of different **wavelengths**,
including all the colors we can see.

Of all the **wavelengths** in the sun’s light, there
is just a little more of the yellow **wavelengths** that
reach our eyes than the other colors. This is why the
sun looks yellow when we see it against the blue
sky. Still, the light from the sun includes all of the
other colors and **wavelengths** . You will learn more
about **white light**, visible light, and colors in a later
chapter in this Reader.



6


_**White light**_ _is a well-balanced mix of different_ _**wavelengths**_ _._



7


Although the sun is the greatest **source** of visible
light, there are also other **sources** of light. What
else in the sky provides light? The other stars in the
night sky provide light, though it is not as bright as
the light from the sun during the day. The moon is
not a star and does not give off its own light.

Can you think of other **sources** of light? Is there
light in your classroom right now? Perhaps it is from
the sun shining through the windows. Chances are
good, though, that some of the light in the room
may be coming from light bulbs. Like the sun,
most light bulbs give off **white light** . **Electric** lights
are such a part of our everyday life, we don’t even
think about them—unless the **electricity** goes off!
This doesn’t happen often, but sometimes it does
during a bad storm. When the electricity goes off
and we do not have light from light bulbs, people
sometimes use other **sources** of light, like flashlights
or candles.



8


_Can you think of_ _**sources**_ _of light other than the sun?_



9


Light is important for many reasons. Light and
heat from the sun warms Earth. Without the light
and heat from the sun, Earth would be freezing
cold. You also learned back in kindergarten that
the sun’s light is needed for plants to grow. Also,
without light, there would be no colors. Can you
think of another reason that light is important?

Try to imagine a world in which there is no
light—no sun, no stars, no candles, and no light
bulbs. What would be different? If you just said that
it would be dark, you are only partly right. What
else would change? Without light, you would not be
able to see anything! A world without light is almost
impossible to imagine.


10


_Here is a scene with lots of light._


_Here is the same scene without any light._



11


**Chapter**
#### **How Are** **Shadows Made?**
## **2**

Do you remember any interesting facts about
how light travels? In the last chapter, you learned
that it travels in waves that can be measured as
wavelengths. You also learned that it travels at a very
high rate of speed. Here’s another interesting fact—
light waves travel from a source in straight lines that
spread out in all directions, like rays, until they hit
another object.

Take a look at the image on the opposite page.
In this image, there are several light sources. Each
source or dot of light has several rays of light
shooting out. Put your finger on the source you can
see. Now, using your finger, trace the lines of light
coming out from that source. Each ray of light is a
straight line.


12


_Light travels in straight lines like rays from its source._



13


Have you ever wondered what happens when a
line or path of light bumps into something in its
way? Different things may happen depending on
what exactly is in the light’s path.

If a path of light hits something that is
**transparent**, most of the light will pass right
through. Air, water, and glass are all **transparent** .
When light hits these **transparent** objects, it passes
through to the other side. It is almost as if the object
isn’t there.

Most buildings have glass windows so that
natural sunlight can travel from the outdoors inside.
Have you ever been in a building that has a glass
roof or **skylight** ? Sometimes you can even see blue
sky and clouds through the **skylight** !


14


_How do you know that the glass in this_ _**skylight**_ _is_ _**transparent**_ _?_



15


Light cannot travel through all materials. If a
path of light hits something that is **opaque**, the
light is **absorbed** and blocked by the object. It
cannot continue in a straight line through the
object. Wood, cardboard, and even a person’s body
are all **opaque** objects. Light cannot pass through to
the other side. Instead, a **shadow** is created because
the light is **absorbed** .

Look around your classroom. Do you see
**transparent** objects through which light is passing?
Can you also find **opaque** objects? You will
probably find that your classroom has many more
**opaque** objects than **transparent** objects. Do you
see any **shadows** ?


16


_Are people’s bodies_ _**transparent**_ _or_ _**opaque**_ _? How do you know?_



17


The **shadow** created by blocked light takes on
the shape of the object. Can you guess the object or
objects that are making the **shadows** in these images?


18


_What objects created these_ _**shadows**_ _? Are these objects_ _**opaque**_ _or_
_**transparent**_ _?_



19


The size of a **shadow** depends on several
different things. The closer an object is to a light
source, the larger the **shadow** will be. If you move
the same object farther away from the light source,
the **shadow** will become smaller. So the size of the
**shadow** changes, even though the size of the object
does not. What makes the **shadow** larger or smaller
is the distance of the object from the source of light.


20


_**Shadows**_ _can be different sizes. What causes the size of a_ _**shadow**_ _to change?_


21


You can experiment making larger and smaller
**shadows** just by using your hand. You will need:

   - a light source, such as a flashlight or **projector**

   - several sheets of large white paper and a marker

   - masking tape

   - a blank wall

   - several helpers

   - a cardboard cutout of a tree

First, tape a piece of white paper to the wall.
Then, mark a spot on the floor and tell a classmate
to stand on that spot to **project** the light. He or
she should not move. Now, try holding the cutout
of the tree in front of the light so that a shadow is
**projected** onto the white paper. Have one classmate
put a piece of masking tape marked “1” on the floor
next to where you are standing. At the same time,
another classmate should trace the **shadow** of the
tree on the white paper. Mark this tracing of your
**shadow** with a “1.”


22


tree cutout


_Here’s what you need to experiment with_ _**shadows**_ _._


23


Next, tape up another sheet of white paper. This
time, move away from the light, closer to the sheet
of paper. Have your classmates mark the floor and
**shadow** tracing with a “2.”

Last, try it one more time. This time move closer
to the light—even closer than the spot marked “2.”
Have your classmates mark the floor and **shadow**
tracing with a “3.”

Now, compare the tracings. Which is the
biggest? Where were you standing in relation to
the light when the tree made the biggest **shadow** ?
Where were you standing when the tree made the
smallest **shadow** ?


24


25


You can have even more fun making **shadows**
with your hands. Try making the **shadows** in these
drawings. Look carefully at one drawing at a time.
Try placing your hands exactly as shown in the
drawing. Practice several times. When you think
you have it right, try making the shape in front of
the light. If you get really good, you might want to
put on a show for your family!


26


_You can make_ _**shadow**_ _puppets with your hands._



27


**Chapter**
#### **Mirrors and** **Reflections**
## **3**

Have you been to the dentist recently? Do you
remember if they used a tool with a **mirror** to look
at your teeth? Think for a minute about how useful
that **mirror** is. Why does the dentist use it? This
simple tool allows them to see the back of your
teeth. They can also see teeth way in the back of
your mouth. Without it, they couldn’t do their job
nearly as well! Ask to see this tool the next time
you’re at the dentist.

So what is a **mirror** ? A **mirror** has a smooth, shiny
**surface** that **reflects** light. Light that is **reflected**
bounces off of something in its path. You have
already learned that light travels in a straight line,
unless it runs into something in its way. If light hits a
transparent object, it passes right through the object.
If it hits an opaque object, the light is absorbed and
blocked so a shadow is made. If light hits a smooth,
shiny surface like a **mirror**, it is **reflected** .


28


_Light_ _**reflected**_ _from the surface of this_ _**mirror**_ _allows the dentist to see the_
_back of this person’s teeth._


29


When a **mirror** is made, glass is coated with hot,
**silvery** metals and then cooled. This coating makes
the **mirror** shiny so it **reflects** back all the light that
hits it.

Did you know that there are different types
of **mirrors** ? You probably use a **plane mirror**
every morning when you get ready for school. A
**plane mirror** has a more or less flat **surface** . The
**reflection** of something in a **plane mirror** is almost
the same size as the real object.


30


_This little girl is looking at her_ _**reflection**_ _in a_ _**plane mirror**_ _._



31


**Plane mirrors** are used in many tools. Cameras,
telescopes, and microscopes sometimes use **plane**
**mirrors** . Some toys even use **plane mirrors** . Have
you ever looked through a toy called a **kaleidoscope** ?
A **kaleidoscope** is a tube with **plane** **mirrors** inside.
There are also tiny bits of colored glass and beads
sealed up inside the **kaleidoscope** . You look through
a small hole at one end of the **kaleidoscope** and
point it toward the light. As you rotate the tube, you
will see beautiful, colored patterns.


32


_Here’s what the outside tube of a toy_ _**kaleidoscope**_ _looks like._


_Here’s what you might see if you looked inside a_ _**kaleidoscope**_ _._



33


There are two other types of mirrors that are
different from **plane mirrors** . **Plane mirrors** have flat
surfaces, but **concave** and **convex** mirrors have **curved**
surfaces. The smooth, shiny side of a **concave mirror**
**curves** inward like a spoon. The smooth, shiny side of
a **convex mirror** **curves** outward.

Here’s another way that **concave** and **convex**
**mirrors** are different from **plane mirrors** .
Remember that in a **plane mirror,** the **reflection**
of an object is about the same size as the object. In
**concave** and **convex mirrors**, the **reflection** can
look larger or smaller than the real object.


34


_Three types of_ _**mirrors**_


35


**Concave** and **convex mirrors** are also useful.
**Concave mirrors** can be used to provide heat using
the light from the sun. Remember that sunlight is a
form of light and heat energy containing heat and
light. The large **concave mirror** in the image on the
next page **reflects** the sun’s energy so that people
can warm their hands or bodies outside.

What about **convex mirrors** ? The next time you
get on a bus, take a look at the mirrors on the sides
of the bus. Most buses and large trucks have a small,
extra **convex mirror** on the side-view **plane mirror** .
The **convex mirror** makes objects look smaller but
shows a wider area so you can see more. It helps
drivers avoid hitting something they might not see
in the regular **plane mirror** .


36


**CONCAVE**





_**Curved**_ _**mirrors**_ _change the look of things because of the ways they bounce_
_light rays back._


37


So now you see how useful **mirrors** are in our
everyday lives. **Mirrors** can also be a lot of fun.
A circus or carnival sometimes has a place called
the “Funhouse,” or “House of **Mirrors** .” If you go
in, there are lots of **concave** and **convex** **mirrors** .
When you look in these **mirrors**, you might not
recognize yourself! Your **reflection** is **distorted** .
What makes that happen? Now you know it’s
**concave** and **convex mirrors** .


38


_**Concave**_ _and_ _**convex**_ _**mirrors**_ _can_ _**distort**_ _the_ _**reflection**_ _of an object._



39


**Chapter**
#### **Refraction and** **Lenses**
## **4**

In the previous chapters, you have been reading
about how light travels. You already know that light
travels at a very fast speed—faster than any machine
made by humans.

You also know that light travels in a straight line,
unless it runs into something in its way.


40


_When light hits a_
_transparent object, it_
_passes right through_
_the object._


_When light hits an_
_opaque object, the_
_light is absorbed and_
_blocked so a shadow_
_is made._


_When light hits a_
_smooth, shiny surface_
_like a mirror, it is_
_reflected._



41


One of the things we haven’t studied yet is
what happens to the speed of light when it passes
through something transparent. As fast as light
is, when it passes through something transparent,
it does slow down. So, when light passes through
windows, water, and even air, it slows down. The
**denser** or heavier something is, the slower light
travels through it. For example, light travels more
slowly through glass than it does through water or
air. It travels more slowly through water than it does
through air.


42


_Does light travel fastest through glass, water, or air?_



43


When light moves through one thing that
is transparent to something different that is
transparent, it changes speed. When light changes
speed, the **angle** of the light rays change and appear
to bend, making the straw appear to bend.

Take a straw and put it in a glass of water. Now,
look at the straw where it enters the water. Can you
see that it appears to be at a different **angle** ? That is
called **refraction** . It’s caused by the slowing down
of light as it moves from air to water. As the light
enters the water, it changes **angle** direction because
it slows down. It seems like magic, but it’s really just
how light travels—no trick.


44


_Why does the_ _**angle**_ _of the straw look different after it enters the water?_



45


You may be surprised to learn that there are
many ways that we use light **refraction** every day _._
Do you or any of your classmates wear eyeglasses?
The **lenses** in eyeglasses correct different kinds of
vision problems by **refracting** light. Transparent
glass or plastic **lenses** are made to **refract** light in
different ways. Like mirrors, these **lenses** can be
convex **lenses** or concave **lenses** .


46


_**Lenses**_ _can be used to_ _**refract**_ _light to correct vision problems._



47


Remember that something convex curves
outward. A convex **lens refracts** and bends light rays
closer together. When you look through a convex
**lens**, an object will look larger and closer. It looks
**magnified** because the light rays are closer together.

A concave lens curves inward. A concave **lens**
**refracts** and spreads light rays apart. If you look
through a concave **lens**, an object will look smaller. It
looks smaller because the light waves are spread apart.


48


_Convex and concave_ _**lenses**_ _bend light in different directions. Do objects look_
_larger or smaller through a convex_ _**lens**_ _? What about through a concave_ _**lens**_ _?_


49


A **magnifying glass** is an example of a simple
convex **lens** . If you hold and look at something
closely through a magnifying glass, it will look
larger. People use a **magnifying glass** to more
clearly see the details of something small.


50


_A_ _**magnifying glass**_ _has a convex_ _**lens**_ _that makes small details appear larger_
_if you hold the_ _**magnifying glass**_ _close to the object you are looking at._


51


Convex **lenses** are also found in scientific
instruments. A scientist might look through a
microscope with a convex **lens** . The **lens magnifies**
very small things that cannot be seen with the
naked eye.

Scientists study outer space with telescopes.
Telescope **lenses** are also convex. They make the
moon, stars, and planets look larger and closer so
scientists can learn more about them.


52


_are not visible to the naked eye, like these germs._


_Scientists also use telescopes with convex_ _**lenses**_ _to study outer space._


53


Concave **lenses** are also useful. Remember that
concave lenses spread out light rays. Concave **lenses**
are used in flashlights to increase the amount of
light they put out.

Do you wear eyeglasses at school or at home? If
so, you may have a concave **lens** . When people have
a hard time seeing things that are far away, they are
considered nearsighted. Concave **lenses** are used
to correct nearsightedness by spreading light rays
before they make it to the eye’s lens. This helps the
light hit the correct part of the eye, creating a clear
image for the brain.


54


_Concave_ _**lenses**_ _that spread out lights rays are useful for_ _**flashlights**_ _._



55


**Chapter**

#### **Color and Light**
## **5**

Do you remember what color sunlight is?
Hopefully, you didn’t say, no color! You learned that
sunlight is white light. You also learned that instead
of being “no color,” white light is made up of all
the colors of the rainbow. Remember, the sun looks
yellow because it gives off more yellow light than it
does the other colors.

You can prove that white light is really many
colors if you have a wedge-shaped piece of
transparent glass called a **prism** . If you hold a **prism**
near a sunny window, light will shine through and
make a rainbow-like band of colors. This shows that
white light is really made up of all colors.


56


_A_ _**prism**_ _refracts white light into all of the colors of a rainbow._



57


Do you remember what you learned about
refraction? What happens to light when it passes
through something transparent like glass? The light
slows down and changes its path. A **prism** has a
special shape that refracts white light into all of the
colors of the rainbow.

Have you ever seen a rainbow in the sky when
the sun comes out after it rains? Raindrops in the
sky refract the light, just like a **prism** . This is what
creates the rainbow.


58


_A rainbow occurs when raindrops refract sunlight into all of the colors of_
_visible light._


59


When white light is refracted, it often separates
into a combination of colors called the **spectrum** .
The colors in the **spectrum** always appear in the
same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, **indigo**,
and violet. These colors are part of the visible light
**spectrum** . They are the light waves that humans
can see. The colors of visible light are a result
of differences in wavelength. Red light has long
wavelengths and violet light has short wavelengths.

You can remember the names of the colors in
the visible light **spectrum** in the right order if you
can remember this funny name: “Roy G. Biv.” Each
letter in that name stands for a color in the rainbow.
Say it out loud. Try to remember it!


60


_You can remember the order of the colors in the visible light_ _**spectrum**_ _if you_
_remember “Roy G. Biv.”_


61


Did you know that the color of any object
depends on what light wavelengths it reflects?
Different objects absorb light wavelengths of some
colors, but reflect others. This is what creates color.

Blue jeans appear blue because something in the
**material** reflects blue light and absorbs all of the
other light colors. Do you see anyone in your class
today wearing a red sweater? The sweater appears
red because something in the **material** reflects red
light and absorbs all of the other light.

What about things that appear to be white?
They look white because the object reflects all of
the white light wavelengths and doesn’t absorb any
light. Can you guess why something looks black?
Things that appear black do not reflect any light.
They absorb all of the light wavelengths.


62


_Can you explain why each thing appears to be the color it is?_



63


Remember that the colors we see are from light
of specific wavelengths. But, there is much more to
light than just the wavelengths we can see. In fact,
visible light is only a small part of the energy waves
that come from sunlight.

For example, on the shorter wavelength end of
the light **spectrum**, there are invisible **ultraviolet**
light waves that cause sunburn. X-rays are even
shorter wavelengths of light. We can’t see these
light x-rays but they can travel through the human
body. You learned in _How Does Your Body Work?_ that
x-rays are used to create black and white photos of
what’s inside the body. Do you know of any other
ways that x-rays are used?


64


_We can’t see x-ray wavelengths but these light waves can pass through your_
_hand and create an image of your bones on special x-ray film._


65


Another type of invisible light is **infrared** waves.
The wavelengths of **infrared** light are longer than
those of red light. These are the type of light waves
that you use when you click on the **remote control**
to change television channels!


66


_Certain wavelengths of light are invisible. We can’t see the_ _**infrared**_ _light_
_from a_ _**remote control**_ _but we can see its effect when a channel is changed._


67


**Chapter**

#### **What Is Sound?**
## **6**

An alarm clock rings, a dog barks, a voice calls,
“Time to get up!” Every day is full of familiar
sounds but what exactly is sound?

Sound is caused by a back and forth movement
called vibration. Try this. Close your lips and hum.
While you are humming, feel your throat under
your chin. Do you feel something buzzing or
vibrating? What you feel is caused by something
moving back and forth very fast. When you hum,
the **vocal cords** in your throat vibrate back and
forth. This makes the air around them vibrate,
which then creates the sound you hear.


68


_When you hum, your_ _**vocal cords**_ _vibrate to make sounds._



69


Sound, like light, is a form of energy. Also like
light, sound moves in waves. **Sound waves** move
out from a vibrating object, making the air move
back and forth in a way that we can’t see.

Two things must happen to create a sound. First,
something needs to vibrate and create **sound waves** .
Then, something like air or another **medium** needs
to carry the **sound waves** . You hear sounds more
clearly if you are close to whatever is vibrating and
making the **sound waves** . The farther away that the
**sound waves** spread out, the weaker they get. That
is why you can hear a friend standing right next to
you better than if they are calling to you from across
the street.


70


_This is what a_ _**sound wave**_ _might look like if we could see it._


_The next time you turn on your radio or TV, lightly put your fingers on the_
_speakers. Do you feel the sound vibrations?_


71


Sound travels not only through air, which is a
gas, but through other **mediums** . In fact, sound can
travel through solids, liquids, and gases.

Think about sound traveling through solids, like
a window or even a closed door. If you are close
enough, you can still hear sounds on the other side
of a window or door.

How about liquids? Have you ever been
underwater in a swimming pool when you have
heard someone’s voice or another sound? It probably
sounded different than it would if you were not
under water, but you were still able to hear it. This
is an example of sound traveling through a liquid—
the water in the pool.

One place that sound cannot travel is in outer
space. Sound cannot travel through the emptiness,
or vacuum, of space. There is no sound in outer
space because there is no **medium** to carry it.


72


_Sound travels through solids, liquids, and gases (air)._



73


You might wonder about the speed at which
sound travels. **Sound waves** travel much slower than
light waves. **Sound waves** travel at about 750 miles
per hour. That’s fast, but not close to the 186,000
miles per second that light can travel. It would
take a sound 33 hours to travel around Earth once _._
Remember that light can go seven times around
Earth every second !

Here’s an example to prove that light travels
faster than sound. Think about the last time you
were around a storm with thunder and lightning.
Did you notice that you saw each flash of lightning
before you heard the clap of thunder? That’s because
light travels faster than sound!


74


_During a storm, you will see lightning before you hear thunder. That is_
_because light travels faster than sound._



75


The **medium** through which sound travels
affects its rate of speed. Interestingly, **sound waves**
travel fastest through solids. In old western movies,
you may have seen a cowboy put his ear down to
the steel railroad tracks to hear if a train is coming.
That is because the sound travels faster through the
steel than through the air.

Try this. Listen while you drum your fingers on
your desk. Now, rest your ear right on the surface of
the desk and drum your fingers again. Which way
sounded louder?

The sound was louder when you put your head
on the desk. This is because the sound traveling
through the solid wood of your desk traveled
faster than if it had first traveled through the air.
Every time sound changes **mediums**, it loses some
of its loudness.


76


_Sound travels fastest through solids, such as the wood of your desk or a wall._

**Chapter**
#### **Characteristics** **of Sound**
# **7**

Let’s review what you have learned so far about
sound by comparing it to light. How is sound
different from light? Sound must have a medium to
travel through—a solid, liquid, or gas. Light does
not need a medium. Remember, light can travel
through the emptiness, or vacuum, of outer space.
Sound cannot.

The speed at which light and sound travel is also
different. Light travels much faster than sound.

There are important ways that light and sound
are similar. They are both forms of energy that travel
in waves. There are also other similarities.


78

_Both light and sound are forms of energy that travel in waves._



79


When you learned about light, you learned that
light waves can be different lengths. Some are long
and some are short. It is the length of a light wave
that makes it appear to be a particular color.

Perhaps you are wondering whether sound
waves differ from one another. Imagine these two
sounds—a baby crying for its mother and an adult
yelling. Both of these are sounds. The sound waves
of each travel through the same medium, air, so
they are alike in that way. But a baby crying surely
sounds different than an adult cheering! The baby
makes a high- **pitched**, “screeching” sound. When
an adult cheers, it is a low- **pitched**, deep tone.
Could this difference in **pitch**, or how high or how
low a sound is, come from different kinds of sound
waves?


80


_Both of these sounds travel through air. How are they different?_



81


The answer is yes and it has to do with the length
of the sound waves! It helps if we first understand
how vibrations affect sound waves. Faster vibrations
produce shorter sound waves, which make sounds
with a higher **pitch** . The baby’s screeching sound
vibrates very rapidly, making shorter, but more,
sound waves. Can you think of some other sounds
that have a high **pitch** ?

Slower vibrations produce longer waves, which
make sounds with a lower **pitch** . A yelling voice
makes longer, fewer waves so you hear a lower
**pitch** . **Pitch** describes the highness or lowness of a
sound. Can you think of some sounds that have a
low **pitch** ?

Try changing your voice **pitch** . Can you speak
in a high, squeaky voice? Can you speak in a low,
rumbling voice?


82


_Which sounds are high-_ _**pitched**_ _? Which are low-_ _**pitched**_ _?_



83


Sound also varies in loudness. If you’re listening
to the radio and a favorite song comes on, you
might say, “Turn it up!” and reach for the knob
marked **VOLUME** .

When you turn up the **volume**, you are making
the sound louder. A scientist might say that you are
increasing the sound’s **intensity** _._ More **intense** sound
waves carry more energy and make louder sounds.

How far away you can hear a sound depends on
its **intensity** . A quiet sound, like a whisper, doesn’t
travel very far. A really loud sound can travel for
hundreds of miles. When fireworks are set off, the
sound can be heard miles away.


84


_Sounds with greater_ _**intensity**_ _are louder and travel greater distances._



85


Very loud sounds can **damage** your hearing.
People who work around loud sounds all day long
often wear ear coverings or plugs to protect their
hearing. You should be careful, too, not to turn the
**volume** too loud if you like to listen to music.


86


_Listening to loud sounds repeatedly can_ _**damage**_ _your hearing._



87


**Chapter**
#### **The** **Human Voice**
## **8**

Have you ever noticed how well you know your
mother or grandmother’s voice? You have heard it
so often that you can tell right away who it is. Each
person has a distinct voice. It’s a voice that can make
many sounds with different pitch and intensity. It
can make high- and low-pitched sounds, loud and
soft sounds.


88


_Do you recognize the voices of your friends and people in your family?_



89


So how does your body make all of those
different sounds? You already know that something
needs to vibrate to create sound waves. You also
know that sound needs a medium, like air, to travel
through. Here’s how it works in the human body.

Air passes in and out of your body all of the time
when you breathe. Inside your chest, your **lungs**
expand to take in air and then contract to let it out.

Leading out of your **lungs** is a long tube called
the **trachea**, or “windpipe.” At the top of your
trachea is another part of your body called the
**larynx**, or “voice box.”


90


_Air passes in and out of your body through the_ _**larynx**_ _,_ _**trachea**_ _, and_ _**lungs**_ _._


91


Inside the **larynx** are two bundles of muscle that
are known as vocal cords. When you breathe in,
the vocal cords relax so that air can move past them
and into your lungs. When you speak, you force
the air out of your **lungs** and over the vocal cords
in your **larynx** . The vocal cords vibrate to make
waves in the air that continue up your throat and
out of your mouth.


92


_When you speak, air is forced from your_ _**lungs**_ _and_ _**trachea**_ _to your_ _**larynx**_ _._
_The vocal cords in your_ _**larynx**_ _vibrate to make waves in the air. These_
_vibrations make sounds._


93


When you were a baby, you did not need to learn
how to breathe. Your **lungs** worked **automatically**,
bringing air into and out of your body. You also did
not need to learn how to use your vocal cords to
make sounds. When you were a baby, you made lots
of funny noises and grunts. Ask your parents!

You did, however, need to learn how to change
those grunts and noises into words so you could
talk. You did this by listening to the people who
talked to you when you were a baby. You practiced
saying the same sounds and words. You learned to
speak whatever language all of those people were
speaking to you. If your family spoke only English
to you, you learned to speak English. If your family
spoke only Spanish to you, you learned to speak
Spanish. People can learn to speak more than one
language. Maybe you or some of your classmates
speak more than one language.


94


_When you were a baby, you learned to speak the same language that the_
_people around you were speaking._



95


Your vocal cords grow as you grow. When you
have shorter vocal cords, you tend to speak at a
higher pitch. This is why small children have higherpitched voices than adults. The pitch of your voice
depends on the size of your vocal cords and **larynx** .

The volume of your voice, or how loudly you
speak, depends on how much air is produced by
your **lungs** and comes out of your mouth. When
more air is pushed out of your mouth, your voice
will be louder.


96


_Who do you think has shorter vocal cords and speaks in a higher-pitched_
_voice?_


97


**Chapter**
#### **Light and** **Photography**
## **9**

The word **photography** comes from two Greek
words. _Photo_ means “light” and _graphein_ means “to
draw.” So you might say that **photography** means
“to draw with light.”

The earliest ideas for making pictures using light
came in the 4th century BC from a man named
**Aristotle** . He observed and made notes about how
light acts.

The first person to put **Aristotle’s** ideas into
practice was a scientist, Alhazen, around 1000 AD.
He made the first pinhole camera. It was a box with
a small hole in one side. Light from the outside came
through this little hole and projected an image on
the opposite side of the box. Alhazen used it to help
him draw. His camera did not take **photographs**
as we know them today. Others continued to
experiment with and improve pinhole cameras. Even
today, some people still enjoy making their own
simple pinhole cameras.


98


_Alhazen_ _**Aristotle**_


_Pinhole cameras do not have lenses. There is just a small hole on one side of_
_the box that lets light into the box. A figure is projected on the opposite side of_
_the box._


99


The first thing similar to a **photograph** was
made in 1826 by Joseph Niepce [NEEP-see]. He
**invented** what were called **heliographs** . _Helio_ is the
root for “sun.” He used sunlight to create images.
The sunlight mixed with a form of coal and some
other natural chemicals on a square, glass plate to
make an image. It took eight hours in the sunlight
before the image appeared! Then, it faded.


100


_Joseph Niepce_ _**invented**_ _**heliographs**_ _._



101


Another Frenchman named Louis Daguerre

[Də-GAIR] took Niepce’s ideas and improved
them. He was able to use light to create an image
in less than thirty minutes. His images were
called **daguerreotypes**, named for their **inventor** .
**Daguerreotypes** used light-sensitive chemicals like
silver and iodine to make an image on a metal plate.
These became popular around the world.


102


_Louis Daguerre_


_Here is an 1850_ _**daguerreotype**_ _of a young woman._



103


The late 1800s brought even more
improvements to **photography** thanks to some very
creative **inventors** . One such **inventor** was George
Eastman. In 1888, he **invented** flexible, rolled film
that could replace the glass plates that were used in
earlier cameras.


104


_George Eastman_ _**invented**_ _film for use in cameras._



105


The **invention** of film led to the creation of the
box camera, which was a tight box with a simple
lens. The camera had film that could take as many
as 100 **photos** . People could take **photos** and then
send the camera back to Eastman’s company to
print the **photos** . The company then sent both the
**photos** and camera back to you. Ask to see your
family’s older **photo** album. Chances are that some
of the much older **photos** may have been taken with
a box camera.


106


_An early box camera and a roll of film_



107


Color films were not **invented** until the late
1930s and early 1940s. By then, most families
owned at least one camera and **photo** albums
became a common, household item.

Cameras improved at a fast rate around the
1950s. Instant **photography** was **invented** by
Edwin Land, who sold his first camera in 1948.
With his camera, one minute after you took
the **photo**, you would have a fully developed
**photograph** from the camera. These cameras were
popular because people did not have to wait to get
their **photos** . They had them right after they shot
the **photo** with their camera.


108


_With the_ _**invention**_ _of the instant film camera, a fully developed_ _**photo**_ _was_
_ready one minute after you took the picture._


109


Chances are that if you or your family has a
camera now, it is a digital camera. Digital cameras
do not use film like the early cameras described
previously. Digital cameras have a special computer
“chip” that takes the place of film. In fact, many cell
phones now also have digital cameras. Imagine how
amazed the early **inventors** would be to see all of
the cameras we have today!

#### **[Alexander ]** **Graham Bell,**

**Part I**
# **10**

What makes someone famous? Who would you
think of if you were asked to name someone famous
today? Would you name a famous athlete? An actor
or musician? Maybe you would think of a president
or famous leader. One of the most famous inventors
of all time lived over 100 years ago. His name was
Alexander Graham Bell.


112


113


Alexander Bell was born March 3, 1847. He was
the middle of three sons born to Alexander and Eliza
Bell of Edinburgh, Scotland. His parents nicknamed
him “Aleck” as a young boy. Aleck’s childhood was
happy. He lived the best of both worlds by spending
time at his home in the city of Edinburgh and also in
the country on the weekends. More than anything,
Aleck loved to learn new things.

At Milton Cottage near Edinburgh, young Aleck
enjoyed exploring nature. He collected plants and
studied animals.


114


_Aleck as a child with his family_



115


In school, Aleck’s best subjects were science and
music, which he learned from his mother. Aleck’s
mother was nearly deaf, so she played music mostly
by feel. To hear the music, she would put a **hearing**
**trumpet** to the strings of the instrument. The
**trumpet** magnified the sound.

Aleck’s father was an important speech **professor** .
He studied the sounds of the English language,
similar to the phonics you studied to learn to read.
He very much wanted to help his wife, Eliza, and
other deaf people. In 1864, he invented a “sound
alphabet” called **Visible Speech** . He spent years
coming up with **symbols** to stand for any sound
the human voice could make. The **symbols** that he
used looked the way a person’s mouth looked when
making certain sounds. **Visible Speech** helped deaf
people learn how to talk better so that they could
communicate with others.


116

_Mrs. Bell is using to listen to her granddaughter?_


_A_ _**Visible Speech**_ _poster showing the_ _**symbols**_ _invented by Aleck’s father to_
_help the deaf._


117


The example of both his mother and father was
an **inspiration** for Aleck. He became interested in
inventing things on his own. He especially wanted
to invent things to help other people. As an adult,
Aleck worked with deaf students. He later took a
job as a **professor** at Boston University. Inventing
things was a big part of Aleck’s life. After one
invention, he set his mind on others, never satisfied
with the past invention. The invention that he is
most famous for, however, was yet to come.


118


_When he was young, Aleck invented a “speaking machine.”_



119


**Chapter**
#### **[Alexander ]** **Graham Bell,**

**Part II**
# **11**

Aleck Bell loved thinking of new things to
invent more than anything else in the world,
especially to help other people. In 1837, another
inventor, Samuel Morse, created a machine called
the **telegraph** . The **telegraph** was a way to send
messages long distances across wires. It was limited
to dots and dashes and could not **transmit** human
sounds. Aleck began to think about ways that he
might improve upon this new invention. “I used
to tell my friends that one day we should speak by
**telegraph**,” said Bell. He devoted all his time to this
new goal. So did many others and the race for a new
invention was on.


120


_With the invention of the_ _**telegraph**_ _by Samuel Morse, people could send_
_messages long distances. A system of dots and dashes called_ _**Morse Code**_ _was_
_used to tap out the messages on the_ _**telegraph**_ _. Three dots, followed by three_
_dashes, followed by three more dots stands for SOS, code for “Help!”_


121


Boston, Massachusetts became an important
place for many inventors. The Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) made space in one
of its labs for Aleck to do his experiments. His days
were filled with teaching and then trying over and
over to make human sound travel across a wire. All
of his energy was spent on this creative idea. He
wrote that his idea of using **electric current** to carry
a sound would likely make others think him “crazy.”
So, he kept most of his ideas and experiments secret.

Aleck hired a young mechanic to help him.
Thomas Watson knew how electricity worked.
At first, their experiments failed more than they
succeeded. Aleck thought they were getting closer
to success. “I think the **transmission** of the human
voice is much more nearly at hand than I thought.”
On June 2, 1875, his dreams came true.


122


_Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson worked together to try to_
_**transmit**_ _sound using electricity._



123


Like many inventions, an accident led to an
important **discovery** . With the electricity turned
off, Watson sent a message to Aleck that Aleck
could hear. He heard tones, not just one singlepitched sound. He knew instantly it was a huge step
forward! “I have (by accident) made a **discovery** of
the very greatest importance,” wrote Bell.

Three days later, the first telephone recorded,
“Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.” To
Bell’s great joy, Watson had heard and understood
what Bell had said!

Fame and fortune came to Alexander Graham
Bell and Thomas Watson. They soon formed the
Bell Telephone Company to make and sell their
new invention.


124


_Bell’s first telephone_



125


Bell continued to invent the rest of his life. “Selfeducation is a life-long affair,” said Bell. “There is
no failed experiment,” he said to convince people
to keep going with their ideas. He passed his love
of learning on to his grandchildren and inspired a
whole group of new inventors.


126


_“There is no failed experiment,” said Alexander Graham Bell._



127


**Chapter**
#### **Thomas Edison:**
**The Wizard of Menlo**
**Park**
## **12**

Have you figured out why inventors are so
important? They have helped every person’s life in
one way or another. Shouldn’t there be an inventors’
“Hall of Fame?” If there were, then a man named
Thomas Alva Edison would be quickly voted in.

Thomas Alva Edison was born February 11,
1847, in a small, northern Ohio town. He was
the last of seven children born to Sam and Nancy
Edison. Al, the nickname his friends gave him, was
a sickly child. He didn’t even attend school until
he was eight years old. Because of **scarlet fever** as
a child, Al was left more than partially deaf. His
illnesses did not stop his interest in nature. He asked
questions that teachers didn’t know how to answer:
“Why is the sky blue?” or “How does fire work?” He
was curious about everything and liked to figure out
things on his own.


128


_A photograph of Thomas Edison_



129


At the age of 12, he worked selling newspapers
on the railroad near his home. On the train, he
heard people talking about many new ideas and
inventions. He learned by listening to their stories.
At 15, Al landed a job working the telegraph
machine. He became an expert telegraph operator
over the next six years. Even though he was deaf, he
could feel the vibration of the wire.

Al liked to work with electric machines. He
found a way to make the telegraph faster and sold
the idea to Western Union Telegraph Company for
$40,000. With the money he made from the sale, he
set up his first lab to continue his experiments.

When the work Al was doing outgrew this lab,
he built a bigger lab in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He
hired some of the smartest scientists and engineers
from around the world to work with him. Much
of his early work was on sound. They called him
the Wizard of Menlo Park because some of the
inventions seemed magical.


130


_Edison in his lab at Menlo Park_



131


In this new lab, he discovered a way to make
Alexander Graham Bell’s new telephone louder. He
sold the **patent** for his new invention for $100,000.
That was a huge sum of money at the time.

His next invention was the **phonograph** . He
was able to record sound on a cylinder wrapped in
tinfoil. He played a version of “Mary Had a Little
Lamb” to his fellow scientists. This was the first
time anyone was able to listen to recorded music.


132


_Thomas Edison with a_ _**phonograph**_ _, 1878_



133


The invention that Edison is best known
for came next. In 1879, he invented the first
**incandescent** (glowing) electric light bulb. Three
years later, he lit up 85 homes at once in New York
City and the age of electric light began.

By the time Edison “retired,” he had **patents**
on over 1,000 inventions. They include the
**kinetoscope**, which is a machine for showing
movies, and the **microphone** .

What people sometimes forget is that many of
Edison’s experiments “failed” at first. He caused
accidents at his labs and was forced to start all over
many times. However, he kept moving forward each
time. He always had a positive attitude. He knew he
was closer to his next success!
