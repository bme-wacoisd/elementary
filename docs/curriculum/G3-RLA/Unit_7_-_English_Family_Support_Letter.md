# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 3, Unit 7**
## **Native American Regions and Cultures**

Dear family member,


In this unit, students will continue to learn about the first known inhabitants of North
America. The Reader for this unit contains selections that describe the historical events
and cultures of Native Americans.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will explore, in more depth, how some **Native Americans** first **migrated from**
**Asia to North America** and how they started to shape their **customs and cultures** .

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn details about how Native Americans **adapted to the environment** of
the region in which they settled and how that adaptation shaped their cultural identity.
They will also study how Native Americans **spread through the continents** .


They will maintain a “ **unit dictionary** ” notebook, complete **written responses**, submit
**journal entries**, and **categorize information** in graphic organizers. They will also
collaborate and share ideas with their peers.

### **Conversation starters**

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:

1. What does the word migratory mean?

**Follow up:** Would you rather settle in a permanent community or lead a migratory life?
Why?

2. How did farming change the lives of the early people?

**Follow up:** How did people begin to use plants? What else did people raise for food?

3. Describe or draw the following dwellings you have been learning about: adobe house,

mesas, pit houses, cliff dwellings, and pueblo.
**Follow up:** How are they similar? How are they different?

4. What are some of the characteristics you learned about the Southwest region?

**Follow up:** What did you learn about the Hopi people? What about the Hohokam,
Ancestral Pueblo, Jumano, and Lipan Apache tribes? Compare these tribes (for

5. What made the Southeastern Native Americans migrate from the northern part of the

continent to the southeastern part?
**Follow up:** What did they farm? How did farming affect the way they lived? How did
