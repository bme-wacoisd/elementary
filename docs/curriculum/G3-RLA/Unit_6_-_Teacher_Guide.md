Teacher Resources 329


**Grade 3 | Unit 6**
Introduction


~~**ASTRONOMY : OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the _Astronomy: Our Solar_
_System and Beyond_ unit. This unit contains 18 daily lessons, plus three Pausing Point days that may
be used for differentiated instruction. Each lesson will require a total of 120 minutes. Lessons 17
and 18 contain a Performance Task Assessment. At the end of this unit, students will take a Mid-Year
Assessment.


As noted, three days are intended to be used as Pausing Point days. These Pausing Points are
embedded into the instruction at appropriate points, with the first one after Lesson 5, the second
after Lesson 12, and the third after Lesson 18. You may choose to continue to the next lesson and
schedule the first Pausing Point day for another day in the unit sequence. Pausing Points can be
used to focus on content understanding, writing, spelling, grammar, morphology skills, or fluency.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS**~~


**Reading**


The nonfiction Reader for Unit 6, _What’s in Our Universe?_, consists of selections describing the sun,
the eight planets, our moon, asteroids, comets, meteors, galaxies, stars, and important figures in
the history of space exploration, including Nicolaus Copernicus and Mae Jemison. Students will be
given opportunities throughout the unit to demonstrate their understanding about astronomy and
develop reading fluency.


**Spelling**


During this unit’s spelling exercises, students will review words with spelling patterns /j/, /n/, /ae/,
/k/, and /s/. In Lessons 1–5, students will review words with spelling patterns of /j/ spelled ‘g’, ‘j’,
‘ge’, ‘dge’, and ‘dg’. For Lessons 6–10, students will review words with spelling patterns of /n/ spelled
‘n’, ‘nn’, ‘kn’, and ‘gn’. Finally, in Lessons 11–15, students will review words with spelling patterns of /
ae/, /k/, /s/, /j/, and /n/. Students will have two or three Challenge Words and one Content word
added to each spelling list.


You will also continue to teach dictionary skills. As this unit progresses, students should become
proficient in the application of guide words.


**Grammar**


In grammar, students will review the conjunctions _and_ and _because_ and be introduced to the
conjunctions _so_ and _or_ . Students will continue their study of cause and effect, understanding
that the conjunction _because_ announces the cause and the conjunction _so_ announces the effect.


Introduction
**1**


Students will also recognize that the conjunctions _and_ and _or_ are opposites, as the conjunction _and_
includes topics, ideas, or things in sentences, whereas the conjunction _or_ excludes topics, ideas, or
things in sentences. They will be introduced to the correct punctuation needed for presenting items
in a series in a sentence and will review the use of quotation marks in dialogue. Students will be
introduced to singular and plural possessive nouns.


**Morphology**


During the morphology portion of the lessons, students will study the common suffixes _–ful_ and
_–less_ . Students will also review the suffixes _–ous_, _–ive_, and _–ly_ . Students will continue to practice
using their knowledge of how these suffixes change the meaning and part of speech of these
words. Students have done sufficient word work to be able to apply what they have learned as they
encounter unfamiliar words in text and content.


~~**WHY ASTRONOMY IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will build upon what students have already learned about astronomy and introduces them
to new information about this science. Through reading and listening to Read-Alouds, students
will learn more about our solar system, our galaxy, other galaxies, and the universe. Students will
study the concept of gravity and its effects on Earth and in other places in space. A foundation of
knowledge will be laid for more in-depth study in later grades of topics such as matter, light-years,
and black holes. Students will learn the difference between a hypothesis and a theory and hear
about key people and events involved in the study and exploration of outer space.


The texts that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provide opportunities for students to
build content knowledge and draw connections to science and social studies. You may build on class
discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Earth and
Space, Force, Motion, and Energy, Scientific and Engineering Practices, and Recurring Themes and
Concepts from the Science TEKS and Science, Technology, Society, and Social Studies Skills from
the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade level Science and Social Studies
instruction. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine
the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


Unit 6 Astronomy
**2**


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades 1 and 2 will be familiar with some
of the information concerning our solar system, sun, and planet Earth—especially the reason for
the seasons. For students who have not received prior instruction in the program, introductory
knowledge is addressed at the beginning of each unit.


Astronomy: Space Exploration (Grade 1)


Cycles in Nature: Clouds to Raindrops (Grade 2)


~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students have many opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for different purposes. The
formal writing piece for the _Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond_ unit is a multiday informative
writing project that describes a day in the life of an astronaut on the International Space Station.
This project is also the final unit assessment. Students will gather information, take and organize
notes, and use the writing process to plan, draft, revise, edit, and publish the final piece. The writing
piece can be done with or without the use of technology, but having students use computers to
research, write, and publish their informative writing is highly recommended.


Everyday writing opportunities come in many forms, including short and extended responses
requiring evidence from the text. Students will write reflections about what they’ve learned and
give opinions. Students will also use graphic organizers to gather and categorize information from
reading or from the Read-Aloud, or to plan for writing. Many lessons provide opportunities for
students to collaborate, share ideas, and give feedback on their writing.


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving
appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete
activities in cursive throughout the unit.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words


Introduction
**3**


~~**PERFORMANCE TASKS AND ASSESSMENTS**~~


The Primary Focus objectives in each lesson are carefully structured and sequenced throughout
the unit to help build student understanding. Additionally, formative assessments are provided to
help keep track of students’ progress toward objectives and standards. These can be found in the
Student Activity Book and are referenced in every lesson.


In this unit, _Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond_, there is an informative writing project
that spans Lessons 17—18. In this task, students will be asked to write about a day in the life of
an astronaut on the International Space Station. Students will use multiple sources to gather
information and then plan, draft, revise, edit, and publish their final version. This project gives
teachers the opportunity to evaluate students’ abilities to read and gather important information
and then synthesize that information into a specific writing task. Teachers use the provided rubric to
evaluate and score the finished work.


**Mid-Year Assessment**


In this unit, a Mid-Year Assessment is provided after Pausing Point 3. There are three main
components of the assessment: an assessment of silent reading comprehension, a written
assessment of morphology, and a written assessment of grammar.


The written assessment of silent reading comprehension is meant to be completed over the
course of one or two 30-minute blocks of time. This should approximate the extended end-ofyear assessments that Grade 3 students may take. There are 5 passages for students to read and
questions after each passage for students to answer.


Students should remain seated and be encouraged to work diligently throughout the time allotted
for the assessment. You should circulate throughout the room, giving encouragement to students.
You should not, however, provide any assistance in reading or explaining any part of the assessment.
If students ask for help, simply say in a kind and encouraging voice, “I just want you to do your very
best. If you can’t figure something out, then come back to it later.”


Similarly, the morphology and grammar assessments are meant to be completed in one 30-minute
sitting each. Students should again be encouraged to do their very best work and remain seated while
all classmates finish.


The oral portion of the assessment evaluates skills in reading words in isolation. Students will be
asked to read words one-on-one as you mark their pronunciation on a sheet that lists the phonemes
and syllabication of each word. Explicit directions for the administration of this test are included in
this Teacher Guide.


Unit 6 Astronomy
**4**


In the Pausing Points, we have supplied independent practice activities and worksheets for students
to complete as you work one-on-one to evaluate each student in your classroom individually using
the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment. The use of these worksheets at any point during the
week is at your discretion.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component was created to accompany materials for Grade 3. It consists of selections from a variety
of genres, including poetry, folklore, and fables. These selections provide additional opportunities
for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). For more information on
implementation, please consult the supplement.


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL COMPONENTS**~~


**Teacher Resources**


There are 10 Image Cards in your kit that include pictures to augment instruction of the _Astronomy: Our_
_Solar System and Beyond_ unit.


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section,
you will find the following:


  - Glossary


  - Decodable Passages


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


**Digital Resources**

                  - Tell students that over the next few weeks they will be learning about outer
space and the study of outer space called _astronomy_, and they will be
gathering information about space.


                 - Ask students to repeat the word _astronomy_ with you. Explain that _astro_                  - is
a word part that came from the ancient Greek word root _astron_ that means
“star,” and that astronomy includes the study of stars.


                  - Tell students that astronomy also includes the study of all objects in space
and that these are sometimes referred to as celestial bodies, which are
fancy ways of saying natural objects in the sky. Ask students, “If astronomy
is the study of the stars and other objects in outer space, what do you think
a person who studies astronomy is called?” Tell students that _astronomers_
are scientists who study all of the objects in outer space and that most of
what we know about outer space we have learned from the observations,
measurements, and thinking of astronomers.


                  - Tell students that during this class they will often hear the word _solar_ used.
Ask students to repeat the word _solar_ with you. Explain that _sol_ is Latin
for “the sun” and that _solar_ means “related to the sun.” Ask students what
phrases that include the word _solar_ are familiar to them.


                  - Tell students that they will also be hearing the word _lunar_ . Ask students if
they remember from Grade 1 _Astronomy: Space Exploration_ what the word
_lunar_ means. (related to the moon)


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**12**


 - Explain that _lunar_ comes from the Latin word _luna_, or moon. Many words used in
astronomy come from the ancient Greeks and Romans. Learning to look for and
decode Greek and Latin roots can help a reader understand scientific terms. The
roots _sol_, _luna_, and _astro_ appear in many English words. For example, what is an
_astronaut_ ? (someone who travels to the stars) What is a _solarium_ ? (a sunroom)
What is a _lunar month_ ? (the time between full moons, about 29 days)


 - As you read, model appropriate rate and accuracy for students. Make sure to
model full stops at periods and pauses at commas. Some of the vocabulary
may be unfamiliar to students, as you read ask students to repeat the word
back to you after you say it. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


 - At the end of the Read-Aloud, ask students what they noticed about your reading.

  - Remind students that words in addresses can be abbreviated, such as _Street/_
_St., Avenue/Ave., Drive/Dr.,_ and _Place/Pl._ States can also be abbreviated in
addresses. Provide a list state abbreviations, such as _TX_ for _Texas._

A mail carrier could find our school and

deliver this envelope from anywhere in

the world!


But let’s pretend you traveled far, far



away to a distant place in outer space, and an extraterrestrial being

asked, “Where in the universe is your school located?” How would you

answer that question? You would need to give someone who lives far

away from Earth more information as part of your school’s address—a

“space address” that explains where your school is located on a map of

the universe.


The first part of your space address that you would add to the

envelope is your planet: Earth.


~~Add “Planet Earth” after the country on the envelope or board.~~


You might think you already know everything there is to know about

Earth—after all, you’ve lived here your entire life! But what do we really

mean when we say we live on a planet? The word _planet_ comes from the

Greek word _planetes_ which means “wanderer”, a name ancient Romans

gave to objects in the sky that appeared to wander on a different path

than the stars did. As astronomers have continued to observe and study

space with more powerful tools and learn more, they kept thinking about

and discussing the exact definition of a planet. Scientists today classify

a planet as having five important qualities:


                          - A planet is a sphere or nearly round object in space that has a large mass.


                          - A planet travels (or wanders) in a path—called an orbit—around a star.


                          - A planet has cleared out most other objects from its path as it orbits

around the sun.


                          - A planet is mostly made of rock or gas or a combination of both.


                          - A planet does not make its own light, but it shines in the sky because it

reflects the light of the star it orbits.

Earth with the Sun Beyond


Planet Earth is made of rock and

orbits a star you already know by

name. Can you guess it? Earth’s star

is the sun! The sun (like all stars) is



an enormous mass of incredibly hot gas. It creates a huge amount of

energy in the form of light and heat. Earth is one of eight planets that

orbits, or revolves around, the sun.


  - Show Image Card C.U6.L1.1


You should remember talking about the sun in our Light and Sound unit.
What else do you remember about the sun?


» Answers vary but may include: The sun sends visible and invisible light waves; all

living things need the sun to survive; etc.


Actually, Earth is the third planet away from the sun—93 million miles

away, to be exact! That’s a long way! If you drove from Earth to the

sun in a car going 60 miles an hour—or about the speed you might

travel on a highway—it would take you almost 177 years to get there

(and that’s without stopping to stretch!).


Most living things on Earth need heat and light from the sun to survive.

Ninety three million miles may seem far from the sun, but it’s actually

the perfect distance for human, animal, and plant life on Earth to exist.

If the sun were closer to Earth, it would be too hot—so hot that Earth’s

water would boil away. If the sun were farther away, it would be too

cold—so cold that all Earth’s water would freeze completely. As it is,

Earth’s position in our planetary system is just right for life. In fact,

Earth is the only place in our sun’s system of planets—or in the entire

universe—where we know life exists.

~~planetary systems similar to ours, but we still know very little about~~

~~them because they are so far away.~~

planet. Earth’s atmosphere traps the sun’s heat, keeping it near the

surface of Earth. This keeps Earth from getting too cold.


Earth’s atmosphere is all around us. Take a deep breath and hold it.


You have just breathed in some of the atmosphere! Now breathe out.

Your breath has just added something to the atmosphere! Besides

providing the air we breathe, the atmosphere also protects Earth.

Have you ever put on a jacket to keep from getting sunburned when

you go outside? Earth’s atmosphere is like a jacket for Earth, blocking

some of the sun’s harmful light rays from reaching Earth’s surface.

Earth’s atmosphere also diffuses some of the sun’s light. This is what

makes the sky look blue.


In images of Earth as seen from space, it’s easy to see the blue of

Earth’s oceans. Water covers about 70 percent of planet Earth—

that’s a lot more than half the surface of Earth! Earth’s water is

essential to support plant and animal life as we know it.

Another reason life can exist on Earth

is because of Earth’s atmosphere.

An atmosphere is a covering or

“envelope” of gases that surrounds a





space, but it is still far away. Have you



heard the line in the classic Mother Goose rhyme that said, “The cow

jumped over the moon”?


Well, that was one high-jumping cow! The moon is about 239,000

miles away from Earth. So if the cow “jumped” from Earth to the

moon going 60 miles per hour, it would get there in about 166 days!

That would be one mighty jump for a cow!


You have seen the different phases of the moon as its shape changes

during a month’s time. As the moon orbits Earth, we see different

amounts of sunlight reflected from the moon’s surface.

view. This is known as an eclipse. A solar





eclipse happens when the moon comes



between the sun and Earth, hiding the sun so some people on Earth can’t see

it. A lunar eclipse is when Earth comes between the sun and the moon. When

this happens, people on Earth see Earth’s shadow on the moon, making the

moon appear dark or even seem to disappear. But the moon doesn’t really

disappear—it’s just hidden for a short time in Earth’s shadow.

Earth’s Elliptical Orbit around the Sun


Planet Earth moves in two ways. The

first we’ve already talked about: it

revolves—or travels in a nearly circular





path—called an orbit—around the sun.



The actual path of Earth’s orbit is not a perfect circle. It is just a little longer

in one direction than in the other. The name for this type of nearly circular

path is an ellipse.


- Ask students to draw an ellipse on a scrap of paper. Have several students
describe what it looks like. Draw an ellipse on the board so they can compare
their drawings to yours.

Lesson 1 The Sun, Earth, and Our Solar System
**17**


An orbit that is shaped like an ellipse is described as an elliptical orbit. It

takes Earth 365 and ¼ days to orbit the sun one time—so Earth’s year is

365 days. The amount of time it takes a planet to orbit the sun one time is

called its planetary year. But what about that extra ¼ day? Why don’t we

count it? Actually, we do count it; we just don’t count it every year. Instead,

we add up this extra ¼ day for four years in a row to make one full day.


~~On the board, write the following as you say it aloud: ¼ + ¼ + ¼ + ¼ =~~

~~one day.~~


Then in the fourth year, we add that extra day to the end of February,

so once every four years it has 29 days instead of its usual 28. We call

this year with the extra day a “leap year” because everything “leaps”

ahead by one day.


~~Do you know if this year is a leap year? How do you know? (The~~

~~February calendar would have 29 days.)~~


~~How many total days will be in a leap year? (366)~~

Daytime and Nighttime on Earth


The second way planets in our solar

system move is by spinning as they orbit

the sun. Have you ever spread your arms





wide and twirled yourself around until you

were so dizzy you could hardly stand up?




                  - Tell students to stand up and slowly spin in place.


Can you feel the axis, or centerline, of your body around which you spin?


» Yes.


What parts of your body rotate, or spin, around your axis?


» answers vary


                  - Tell students to sit down.


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**18**


Maybe you have played with a spinning top or have seen an ice-skater

spin quickly around and around on one foot. This is what it means to

rotate. But when a planet rotates, it doesn’t twirl around on feet like

you do—it spins around an imaginary line that goes from its North

Pole to its South Pole, right through its center. This imaginary line is

called the planet’s axis.


  - Use a globe to demonstrate the rotation of Earth on its axis and to show how this
causes day and night. Be sure to spin the globe toward the east as you turn it.


One day is the amount of time it takes for a planet to rotate one

time around its axis. A day on Earth is 24 hours. These 24 hours are

divided into daytime and nighttime. As Earth rotates, half of Earth

faces the sun and receives the sun’s light. It is daytime on this side of

Earth. But at that same moment, the opposite half of Earth is facing

away from the sun. This side of Earth is not receiving any of the sun’s

light, so it is dark there. It is in the Earth’s shadow. It is nighttime.


  - You may also demonstrate this by having a bright light source (representing
the sun) and turning down the rest of the lights in the room. Turn the globe
slowly and point out how different points on the earth go through “day”
and “night.”


We don’t feel Earth spinning. From our viewpoint it looks like the sun is

moving and Earth is not. After all, doesn’t the sun appear to “rise” every

morning in the east and “set” every evening in the west? This daily

motion of the sun from east to west might make it seem like the sun is

moving around Earth, but it’s not. You are moving around the sun! Or

really, Earth is. In the morning, the part of Earth you are standing on is

turning away from darkness and rotating to face the sun.


When the sun is up at its highest point in the sky, Earth has rotated

so you are fully facing the sun. In the evening, Earth turns away from

the sun and it becomes dark again. Why is it dark? Because you are


Lesson 1 The Sun, Earth, and Our Solar System
**19**


in the shadow of Earth! It is night and you go to bed. But as you sleep,

Earth keeps rotating on its axis, and before you know it, your side

of the world will have turned to face the sun again. You and the part

of Earth on which you live will have once again moved out of Earth’s

shadow. And you’ll know that one rotation of Earth—one day—will

have ended. And another one will be just beginning!


Days turn into months, and months turn into seasons. Let’s take a

class poll to find out what season is the favorite.


                 - Keep an informal count as you ask the questions below. Share results with
the students.

                        - Raise your hand if your favorite season is fall.

                        - Raise your hand if your favorite season is winter.

                        - Raise your hand if your favorite season is spring.

                        - Raise your hand if your favorite season is summer.


You might know what your favorite season is, but do you know what

causes the seasons? It’s the combination of the two motions of Earth

that we’ve been talking about: Earth’s orbit around the sun, and

Earth’s rotation on its tilted axis.

Summer and Winter Seasons and the Tilt
of Planet Earth


Remember, an axis is the imaginary

line that goes through the center of a


|Col1|Col2|

planet from its North Pole to its South Pole and then points out into

space in both directions. But a planet’s axis doesn’t always point

straight “up and down” like the axis of a spinning top. Many planets—

including Earth—have an axis that is tilted a little to the side. This tilt

is the key to understanding Earth’s seasons.


~~Point to the axis as the globe is turning and point out that the axis is~~

~~not straight up and down, but is tilted.~~


Because Earth is tilted, there is a time of year during Earth’s orbit

around the sun that the North Pole—and therefore, the whole

Northern Hemisphere—is tilted a little bit toward the sun. This tilt

gives the Northern Hemisphere longer periods of daylight, and

shorter periods of nighttime darkness. Longer periods of daylight

give the sun more time to warm Earth, so it gets hotter. The tilt of

Earth’s axis also makes the sun in the Northern Hemisphere appear

higher in the sky at noon. When the sun is higher in the sky, its rays

hit Earth more directly, at less of an angle. The more directly the sun

hits the Northern Hemisphere, the better job it does of heating that

part of Earth. So it is the tilt of Earth—which causes longer periods of

daylight—and a high noontime sun that make summer happen.


While it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, let’s see what is

happening in the Southern Hemisphere. Why is it winter on this part

of Earth? The reason is, again, the tilt of Earth. When the Northern

Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, the Southern Hemisphere is

tilted away from the sun. This causes the Southern Hemisphere

to have shorter periods of daylight and the sun to appear lower in

the sky at noon. Shorter periods of daylight give the sun less time

to warm Earth, so it is cooler. And when the sun is lower in the sky,

its rays hit Earth at more of an angle, or a slant. This angle makes

the sun have to heat a larger area of Earth with the same amount of

energy—and this means the sun does not feel as warm. The rays of

sunlight are less direct and less intense. It is colder. It is winter.


As Earth continues its orbit around the sun, the axis of Earth

always stays pointed in the same direction. So when Earth reaches

the opposite side of the sun, the South Pole (instead of the North

Pole) is now tilted toward the sun. This means that the Southern

Hemisphere has summer and the Northern Hemisphere has winter.

The seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are always

opposite each other. This is because only one of them at a time is

tilted toward the sun.

Lesson 2 Our Solar System, Part 1
**43**


~~**READ-ALOUD: “OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, PART I” (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students to use Activity Page 2.2 to take notes as you read. Remind
students that taking notes means writing down key words and phrases, not
complete sentences.


 - Tell students that the images they’ll see will show the planets “not to scale,”
meaning that because of the extremely large size of the sun and planets and
the vast distances between the largest planets, it is too difficult to show them
accurately in a picture or diagram.


 - Demonstrate the size differences by holding up a yardstick and saying that
if the yardstick’s length equaled the width of the sun, Neptune would be
the size of a small lemon and there would be two miles between them. Ask
students how big they think Earth would be. Show them the marble and tell
them that it would be about that size in relation to Neptune and the sun.
Tell them that if we shrank down Neptune and Earth to fit onto a piece of
paper, we wouldn’t even be able to see them!


 - Remind students what they learned about abbreviations in addresses in
Lesson 1. Prompt them to recall that words in addresses can be abbreviated,
such as states and words for streets.


 - As you read, model appropriate rate and prosody for students. While reading,
make sure to pay careful attention to the types of sentences (exclamatory,
declarative, interrogative) and reflect that in your tone. Make sure to model full
stops at periods and pauses at commas. ~~**[ TEKS 3.4 ]**~~


 - At the end of the Read-Aloud, ask students what they noticed about your
reading.

Earth?” you would need to be able to include the next part of your

“space address”—your planetary system.

solar system looks a lot like a “bull’s-eye” target.The sun is the “bull’s-eye” at

the center, and the orbits of the eight planets are similar to the rings around it.

Astronomers know for certain about several hundred other planetary

systems, but most astronomers think there may be billions of other

planetary systems in the universe besides our own. Current scientific

evidence suggests that our solar system formed a very long time ago

from a huge cloud of gas and dust. Just how long ago did it form? A

really long time ago! Many scientists think our solar system is about

four and a half billion years old!

apartments like the neighborhood you might live in, our solar system is

made up of the sun and the celestial bodies that orbit around it. Besides

the sun, it includes other interesting things like planets and their moons,

dwarf planets, satellites, asteroids, meteoroids, and comets.


Our solar system is huge—so huge that some of twhe objects in it are

billions of miles away from each other!


As you have heard, the sun is the center of this neighborhood we call our

solar system. Our sun is a star—a gigantic, unbelievably hot mass of gas

that makes light and heat for everything that orbits around it. The sun is so

gigantic that Earth could easily fit inside it—more than one million times!

Our Solar System


There are eight planets in our solar

system. The planet Mercury is the closest





to the sun, followed by Venus, Earth,



Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus (/yoor* *n s/), and Neptune. One

easy way to remember the order of the planets is to remember this

sentence or mnemonic device: **M** any **V** ery **E** nergetic **M** ermaids **J** ust

**S** wam **U** nder **N** eptune.

~~You may wish to write this sentence on the board or on chart paper.~~

~~Have students practice the sentence a few times.~~


~~Ask students if they’ve heard a different sentence to help remember~~

~~the planets. (~~ ~~_“My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles” is_~~

~~_very common._~~ ~~)~~


Besides these eight major planets, there are also a number of smaller

planet-like objects in our solar system, classified as dwarf planets. Pluto

is the most famous dwarf planet, because it was considered to be a

major planet until 2006, when astronomers discovered other small,

planet-like objects in our solar system. Many astronomers from all over

the world met to discuss a new definition of what makes a planet. Why

did Pluto get demoted, or reduced in rank, from planet to dwarf planet?

Astronomers have agreed that a planet has to be able to clear its orbit of

most other objects such as asteroids and other space debris (/d *bre/)¯ .

Because it is so small, Pluto hasn’t cleared these leftover pieces of rock

and dust from its orbit yet. Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet.


Planets don’t make their own light like stars do. When you look up and

see a planet shining steadily in the night sky, it is shining because the

planet is reflecting the sun’s light—not because it’s making its own. If

the light you see appears to be twinkling, this is a star, not a planet.


Each of the eight planets in our solar system receives light and heat from

the sun as it travels in its own special path—or orbit—around the sun. The

orbits of the eight planets get larger and larger the farther away from the

sun they are. Mercury’s orbit is the smallest because it is closest to the sun;

Neptune’s orbit is the largest because that planet is the farthest away.

Lesson 2 Our Solar System, Part 1
**47**


Many, but not all, of the planets have their own natural satellites,

or moons, that orbit around them. Like Earth’s moon, these moons

travel around a planet at the same time that the planet orbits the

sun. It is the light from our sun shining out into the solar system

and being reflected back to us that enables astronomers to see a

planet and its moons. Even though Earth has only one moon, some

of the planets have many. In fact, one of Jupiter’s moons, Ganymede

(/gan* *med/),¯ is larger than the planet Mercury!


- Have students share some of their notes.


**Show Image U6.L2.5**
Orbits of Mercury, Earth, and Neptune


The amount of time it takes a planet to

travel once completely around the sun





in its orbit is called a planetary year.



~~How long is Earth’s planetary year? (~~ ~~_365 ¼ days_~~ ~~)~~


~~Point to Mercury’s orbit on the image as you read.~~


Planets closer to the sun have shorter planetary years than planets

that are farther away. Mercury’s orbit is the fastest of all eight

planets, taking only 88 Earth days to complete its planetary year.


~~Point to Neptune’s orbit as you read.~~


But Neptune takes 165 Earth years to go once around the sun! So a

100-year-old grandmother on Earth wouldn’t even be 1 planetary year

old if she lived on Neptune!


Since Neptune’s discovery in 1846, Neptune has made just over one

trip around the sun.

an axis is the imaginary line that goes from a planet’s North Pole

through its South Pole, right through its center. One day on a planet

is the time it takes the planet to rotate one full time on its axis. Other

planets have shorter and longer days than Earth.


~~How long does it take Earth to rotate once on its axis? (~~ ~~_24 hours_~~ ~~)~~


One day on Mercury takes about 58 Earth days, because Mercury

rotates on its axis very slowly. Jupiter’s rotation is much faster,

clocking in at about 1 Jupiter day for every 10 Earth hours.

Although the eight planets in our solar system have a lot in common,

they are also very different. Many astronomers think that all eight

planets have a solid core, or rocky center. But the first four planets,


Lesson 2 Our Solar System, Part 1
**49**


those closest to the sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are small

in comparison to the other four and have a solid, rocky terrain, or

land surface, that you could walk on if you visited them.


The four planets farthest away from the sun—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,

and Neptune—are called “gas giants.” Why? Because they are mostly

made of gas, so you couldn’t walk on their surfaces if you visited

because there is no solid surface, or terrain, to walk on. The gas

giants are also huge! Jupiter is so huge that more than 1,300 Earths

could fit inside of it!


Most of the eight planets have moons. Mercury and Venus are the only

two planets in our solar system that do not have any moons. Moons are

satellites, or smaller objects that orbit around a larger planet. Earth’s

one moon is considered to be a satellite because it orbits around Earth.


~~Tell students that the moon is a natural satellite. Humans have~~

~~created artifcial satellites that have been placed in orbit around Earth~~

~~to aid in communication and research. Say, “Some of you may receive~~

~~television, phone, or computer signals from a man-made satellite.”~~

Ceres and the Asteroid Belt


Besides the sun, the eight major

planets, their moons, and dwarf planets,

there are also other “neighbors” that

~~“Who can describe what an atmosphere is?” (~~ ~~_an invisible, protective_~~

~~_blanket of air around Earth and other celestial objects_~~ ~~)~~


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**50**


An asteroid is too small to be classified as a planet because it does not have

enough mass or substance to clear other objects and debris from its orbit

around the sun, and it is not round. Most asteroids in our solar system—

thousands of them—are located in orbit between Mars and Jupiter in a

ring called “the asteroid belt.”The largest known object in the asteroid

belt is Ceres (/sir*¯ez/), which is about as large around as the state of

Montana is wide! Ceres, once classified as an asteroid, is now classified as

a dwarf planet because it is spherical in shape. Because it has not cleared

most other objects from its orbit, Ceres is not classified as a planet. Most

asteroids are much smaller than Ceres. Many scientists think that asteroids

are material that was left over from the birth of our solar system.

A Meteoroid and a Shooting Star


One of our neighbors in our solar

system has three different names:





meteoroid, meteor, and meteorite,

depending on where you find it.


|Col1|Col2|
|---|---|
||**U6.L2.9**|



Meteoroids are space debris made of rock or metal that range in

size from tiny pebbles to large boulders. Many scientists think they

may have broken off from other objects in our solar system, such

as asteroids. They are called meteoroids when they are orbiting

the sun in space, but once they enter Earth’s atmosphere they are

called meteors. Meteors are also known as “shooting stars” because

they leave a bright streak or line of light that “shoots” through the

sky. This streak of light is caused when the meteor burns up on its

downward journey through Earth’s atmosphere.


~~“Which object in the image is a meteoroid?” (~~ ~~_the one on the left_~~ ~~)~~

~~“Explain how you know.” (~~ ~~_The one on the left is a meteoroid because_~~

Most meteors are small enough that they burn up completely before

reaching Earth, but sometimes the larger ones make it to the surface.

Meteors that reach the surface of Earth are called meteorites.

Sometimes very large meteorites leave large craters, or pits, on the

surface of Earth.

Comet in Night Sky as Seen from Earth


Did you know there are snowballs

in space? It’s true! They are called





comets. Actually, a comet is a chunk

of ice, dust, and gas that orbits the



sun in a long, stretched-out circle. A comet begins in the outer

reaches of the solar system, and occasionally its orbit brings it in

close to the sun. As a comet approaches the sun, part of its ice

evaporates, making it glow and form a bright “tail” that trails behind

it—sometimes for millions of miles! Comets shine like this because

sunlight reflects off tiny particles of dust that are in the comet’s tail.

Halley’s (/hal*¯ez/ or /h¯a*l¯ez/)] comet is a very famous comet that

was discovered by English astronomer Edmond Halley. He was the

first to realize that it was the same celestial body that returned to

Earth’s skies every 76 years. In the year 1705, he correctly predicted

that the comet would return in the year 1758. The comet was then

named Halley’s comet in his honor. It was last seen from Earth

in 1986.

2. Name the eight planets in order from the sun


» Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune


3. What other celestial bodies can be found in our solar system besides the

sun and its planets?


» dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, meteoroids, moons, debris


4. What is the atmosphere of a planet and how does it affect the planet?


» It is a blanket of gas that surrounds the planet. It holds heat and keeps the planet

at a steadier temperature.


  - Tell students to listen carefully to find out which planets in our solar system

other than Earth have an atmosphere and how the atmosphere affects the
characteristics of the planet.


  - As you read, model appropriate rate and prosody for students. While reading,

make sure to pay careful attention to the types of sentences (exclamatory,
declarative, interrogative) and reflect that in your tone. Make sure to model full
stops at periods and pauses at commas. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~

Lesson 3 The Planets Closest to the Sun

~~**READ-ALOUD: “OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, PART 2” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U6.L3.1**
Mercury


Would you like to take an out-of-this
world trip? Over the next few days, we are

going to go on an exciting tour of space in





our very own classroom “spaceship.”



We’ll start by traveling to the planet that is closest to the sun: Mercury.


As we approach the planet, you will see many craters on its surface,

the result of hundreds of meteoroids hitting the planet. You will

probably notice right away how small it is compared to our planet

Earth. At one-third the diameter of Earth, Mercury is the smallest

planet in our solar system.


~~Where can we see the diameter of Mercury? (~~ ~~_Ask a volunteer to_~~

~~_point it out on the image_~~ ~~). It’s the distance from one side to the other~~

~~across the middle of the planet.~~


It’s certainly hot here. Our spaceship is reading the surface

temperature as being 750 degrees Fahrenheit!


~~Who knows the boiling point of water?~~ ~~_(212 degrees Fahrenheit)_~~


The side of Mercury that is facing the sun is very hot, but the side

of the planet that is facing away from the sun—the dark side of

Mercury—is frigid, dropping to negative 300 degrees Fahrenheit.

You might have guessed that Mercury gets very hot during the day

because it is so close to the sun. But why does it get so cold at night?

It’s because Mercury has no real atmosphere, even though there are

occasionally a few gas particles around the planet. Without a real

atmosphere, there is nothing to trap the sun’s heat to make it stay

warm on the side of the planet that is not facing the sun. The smallest

planet in our solar system, Mercury makes its orbit, or revolution,

very quickly around the sun.


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**62**


~~From yesterday’s Read-Aloud, who remembers how long it takes for~~

~~Mercury to travel around the sun?~~ ~~_(88 days)_~~


Even though Mercury’s year is short, it rotates very slowly on its axis, so

its days are very long. One day on Mercury takes about 58 Earth days!

How would you like to have the sun set and have it stay dark for about a

month’s worth of Earth days before the sun rises again? Now let’s head

for the second planet from the sun in our solar system—Venus!

Venus


The first thing you will notice about

Venus is that, besides being Earth’s

closest neighbor, it is practically the

same size as Earth. Like Earth, Venus

also has an atmosphere. But unlike Earth, the atmosphere of Venus is

made up of very thick gases, including lots of carbon dioxide.


~~Explain that carbon dioxide is one of the gases that people and~~

~~animals on Earth breathe out and that plants take in.~~


Venus’s thick, cloudy atmosphere is also very dense, with 90 times

the pressure or heaviness of Earth’s atmosphere.


Venus is actually hotter than Mercury—more than 850 degrees

Fahrenheit! Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. The

reason it is hotter than Mercury is that Venus’s atmosphere creates

a “greenhouse effect,” which means its dense atmosphere acts like

a thick blanket, trapping the sun’s heat at the surface of the planet.

This causes the planet’s surface temperature to rise because the

heat can’t easily escape into space.


~~Who remembers what a greenhouse is? (~~ ~~_a building with a transparent_~~

~~_glass or plastic roof and walls made to trap in heat from the sun and_~~

~~_grow plants all year round_~~ ~~)~~

The next stop on our tour of our solar

system is home sweet home: Earth, the

third planet from the sun. From way out

here in space, it looks different from all

of the other planets. Planet Earth appears as a swirl of blue, white, and

green thanks to our water-filled oceans, the clouds of our atmosphere,

and the green of the plants growing on our planet. It looks bright and

glowing and alive. We live on a very beautiful planet!

**Show Image U6.L3.4**
Mars


Let’s zoom past Earth and head toward

the fourth planet from the sun in our



planets in our solar system. As soon as you see it, you know why it’s

called the “red planet”—because it really is reddish! The red color

is caused by the presence of rust in the surface rocks. Even though

Mars is only half the size of Earth, it still takes about 24 hours for it

to rotate on its axis. So a day on Mars is nearly the same length as a

day on Earth.


Like Earth, the red planet has an atmosphere—and even polar ice

caps made of frozen water. But the thing that may really catch your

eye as we get closer is our solar system’s tallest volcano, Olympus

Mons, which is three times as high as Mount Everest—Earth’s tallest

mountain! That’s right—Mars has the tallest volcano in our entire

solar system, much larger than any here on planet Earth.

Mars is the last of the four rocky

Mars and Its Moons


As we prepare to leave the Martian

orbit, we will pass by its two moons,

Phobos [foe- bos] and Deimos [dye
mos]. The planet Mars was named for



the Roman god of war—Mars—who was called Ares [air-eez] by the

ancient Greeks. Phobos and Deimos were Ares’ two sons.


Check for Understanding


Have students raise their hands if the following planets you have
discussed so far have an atmosphere: Mercury (no), Venus (yes), Earth
(yes), Mars (yes).


**Show Image U6.L3.6**
Jupiter


We’ll have to go through the asteroid

belt to get from Mars to Jupiter, the





fifth planet from the sun.



~~What objects can be found in the asteroid belt? (~~ ~~_thousands of_~~

~~_asteroids and the dwarf planet Ceres_~~ ~~)~~


The distance between Mars and Jupiter is more than three times the

distance we’ve traveled so far! Do you see Jupiter? There’s no way

you could miss it if you tried! Remember, Jupiter is the largest planet

in our solar system, and it’s absolutely gigantic. It’s so big that more

than 1,300 Earths could fit inside it.


~~If Earth were the size of a math unit cube, Jupiter would be the size of a~~

~~cube made with 11 units on each side. (Show unit cube model—optional)~~


Lesson 3 The Planets Closest to the Sun
**65**


Did you know Jupiter has rings? Saturn is famous for its beautiful

rings, but Jupiter has them, too. In fact, all four of the gas giants in

our solar system—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—have rings,

though the rings are not visible in many images you see of Jupiter,

Uranus, and Neptune.


You may be wondering if we could land on the surface of Jupiter.

Like the other gas giants, there’s not a solid surface to land on—just

hundreds of miles of gas, below which is a sea of liquid hydrogen.

Besides, Jupiter’s atmosphere is extremely cold, stormy, and windy.

These storms are what give Jupiter that marbled appearance. Do you

see that giant spot on its side? That’s called the Great Red Spot, and

it is a gigantic storm that’s bigger than the entire Earth! There’s no

way we could land a spaceship there.


**Show Image U6.L3.7**
Some of Jupiter’s Moons


Let’s take a look at some of Jupiter’s

moons. Scientists have discovered

more than 60 moons so far, so there





are many to choose from! Here are

four moons discovered years ago by Galileo Galilei, a scientist you will

hear more about later. Their names are Callisto, Ganymede, Io [eye
oh], and Europa.


~~Point to moons as they are named clockwise, from top center.~~


Made of materials ranging from frozen ice to molten or melted rock,

these natural satellites have amazing sights which include frozen

oceans and volcanoes.

atmosphere has winds that are even stronger than hurricane winds on

Earth. But what may take your breath away is the sight of the rings. They

are absolutely beautiful! You might be surprised to learn that Saturn’s

rings aren’t solid—they’re made up of millions of pieces of rock and ice!


Astronomers think that the debris in some of Saturn’s rings is held in

place by a combination of the pull from Saturn and the pull of some of

Saturn’s many moons. The moons that are thought to help hold some of

Saturn’s outermost rings in place are called “shepherd moons.”


~~“Shepherd” comes from the word~~ ~~_sheepherder_~~ ~~. How are shepherd~~

~~moons like sheepherders? (~~ ~~_They help to hold the rings in place, like a_~~

~~_sheepherder holds sheep in place._~~ ~~)~~


**Show Image U6.L3.9**
Uranus


It’s time to head to the seventh planet

from the sun in our solar system—





Uranus. If you thought the trip between

Jupiter and Saturn was far, then you



may want to sit back and take a nap. The space between the planets gets

bigger out here where the gas giants are. Uranus is about twice as far from

the sun as Saturn is! No wonder astronomers didn’t discover Uranus until

after the telescope was invented! It’s a long way away from Earth! It took

the NASA spacecraft Voyager 2 12 years to get to Uranus from Earth.


~~What is NASA? (~~ ~~_an acronym for the National Aeronautics and Space_~~

~~_Administration; an organization in the United States that directs space_~~

~~_travel and research_~~ ~~)~~


Lesson 3 The Planets Closest to the Sun
**67**


As we approach Uranus, you may be wondering why it appears to be

rolling on its side. The poles of Uranus are in a different position than the

poles of other planets. Uranus’s axis is tilted a lot more to its side than

the other planets in our solar system. Many scientists think the axis

became so far tilted during a collision that happened when the solar

system was forming. Like the other gas giants, Uranus also has rings

and moons, though the rings are not easy to see like Saturn’s rings.


**Show Image U6.L3.10**
Neptune


Finally, we have arrived at the last

planet—eighth from the sun in our





solar system—Neptune.



~~Tell students that they may remember from The Ancient Rome unit~~

~~that Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, similar to the Greek~~

~~god Poseidon.~~


Even though astronomers knew a celestial object was there before

they identified it, the planet Neptune was discovered fewer than

200 years ago, in 1846. It is the last of the four gas giants in our solar

system. Neptune has two rings around it that are hard to see—many

fewer than Saturn. Scientists don’t know as much about Neptune as

they do about some of the other planets. It’s hard to study because

it’s so far away. Astronomers think Neptune has at least 13 moons.

Like Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, Neptune doesn’t have a solid

surface to land on—making it a bad place for spaceship landings!


Check for Understanding


Have students raise their hands if the following planets have an
atmosphere: Jupiter (yes), Saturn (yes), Uranus (yes), Neptune (yes).
Ask students to raise their hands if a spaceship could land on the surface of
the following planets: Jupiter (no), Saturn (no), Uranus (no), Neptune (no).

Beyond Neptune


Let’s look beyond the last planet,

Neptune, farther out into space. Objects

beyond our eight planets are called

“trans-Neptunian.” Here is where we find

the dwarf planet Pluto.



~~Who recalls what makes Pluto unique? (~~ ~~_It used to be a planet but was_~~

~~_reclassified in 2006 as a dwarf planet._~~ ~~)~~


There are many other trans-Neptunian celestial bodies in our solar system

even farther away than Pluto that astronomers are only beginning to

discover. The distances in space between these objects are astronomical!


~~What do you think astronomical means? (~~ ~~_extremely large_~~ ~~)~~


~~Why do you think that the~~ ~~_word astronomical_~~ ~~came to mean extremely~~

~~large?~~ ~~_(Answers vary, but should include that there are so many stars_~~

~~_(astro) in the universe, that it would be impossible to count them all.)_~~


And beyond our solar system, there’s a whole neighborhood of stars.

And beyond that neighborhood of stars, there are billions of other

neighborhoods of stars! Why, there’s a whole universe out there just

waiting for us to learn more about it!


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~

~~**MORPHOLOGY: SUFFIXES -FUL**~~ ~~**AND -LESS (25 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.A.vi**~~


**Introducing Suffixes –ful and –less**

  - Remind students that suffixes are added to the end of a root word.


  - Tell students that the two suffixes they will study this week are – _ful_ and – _less_ .


  - Also, tell students that the root words this week are nouns, and adding each

suffix, – _ful_ and – _less_, changes the words to adjectives.


  - Write the suffixes on the board and point out that the suffix – _ful_ is
pronounced /f l/ and the suffix – _less_ is pronounced /les/.


**Adding Suffix –ful**

  - Write the following words on the board in cursive: _hope, fear, pain, power._


  - Explain to students that – _ful_ means “full of.”


  - Ask students if they recall what suffix they learned in an earlier unit that also

means “full of.” (– _ous_ )


  - Point out that the suffix – _ful_ only has one letter ‘l’, while the word _full_ has a double ‘l’.


  - Again, tell students that when the suffix – _ful_ is added to a noun, the new

word is an adjective.


  - Write _care_ in cursive or point to the word on the board. Briefly discuss the

meaning of the word and then use it in a sentence.


» effort to do something correctly or safely; I handled the vase with care when I took

it out of the box.


  - Add the suffix – _ful_ to care and have students read the suffix, read the new

word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word.


» full of effort to do something correctly or safely


  - Ask students to provide sentences using the word _careful_ .


» Answers may vary.


  - Ask students for synonyms of _careful_ .


» cautious, attentive


  - Continue in this manner for the remaining – _ful_ words.


**Adding Suffix –less**

  - Write the following words on the board in cursive again: _hope, fear, pain, power._


  - Explain to students that – _less_ means “lacking.”


  - Also, explain that words with the suffix – _less_ mean the opposite of words

with the suffix – _ful_ when they have the same root word.


**TEKS 3.2.A.vi** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of suffixes, including how
they can change base words such as dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling final consonants.



Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**90**


  - Ask students what another word for _opposite_ is.


» antonym


  - Again, tell students that when the suffix – _less_ is added to a noun, the word

becomes an adjective.


  - Write _care_ in cursive or point to the word on the board. Review the meaning and

remind students of its use in a sentence. (effort to do something correctly or safely;
I handled the vase with care when I took it out of the box.)


  - Add the suffix – _less_ to _care_ and have students read the suffix, read the new

word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word. (lacking effort to do
something correctly or safely)


  - Ask students to provide sentences using the word _careless_ .


» Answers may vary.


  - Ask students for synonyms of _careless_ .


» inconsiderate, insensitive, thoughtless


  - Continue in this manner for the remaining – _less_ words, using the following

chart as a guide.


  - Display the words that are listed at the top of Activity Book 4.2 for students to decode.


  - Model decoding by first isolating the suffix, then isolating the vowel in the

base word, and then reading the word.


  - Have students come up to the board and follow the same process to the

remainder of the words.


  - As students decode the words, discuss the meaning of each word, how the suffix

changes the meaning, and why it is important to note that when reading a text.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 4.3 and complete a quick guided dictation/
encoding activity of words using _-ful_ and _-less_ .


  - Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

**Pages 30–31**

 - Point students’ attention to the image on page **31** . Read the caption together

as a class or have a student read it to the class.


 - Ask students to read pages **30–31** to themselves to find the answer to the

question: “What is a comet and what is it made of?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students

to answer.


» A comet is a ball made of ice and dust that streams gas off the end when it gets

close to the sun.


 - Ask students, “How often can we see Halley’s comet?”


» every 76 years


 - Have students figure out the answer to the question on page **30** .

Challenge


Have students research
other comets that visit
Earth frequently.



Lesson 5 Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors
**99**


Other kinds of space rocks called **meteoroids** are also
found throughout the **solar system** . When a **meteoroid**
enters Earth’s **atmosphere**, we call it a **meteor** . Small
pieces of the **meteor** burn brightly and look like a white
trail across the sky when viewed from Earth. Sometimes
people call this a “shooting star.” Have you ever seen
one? A **meteor** “shower” is when many **meteors** can be
seen falling in the sky on the same night. Sometimes
they last over several nights. It’s an amazing space show!


If a **meteor** doesn’t fully burn up in the **atmosphere**,
it falls to Earth and can make a large hole called a crater.
Pieces of a **meteor** found on the ground are **meteorites.**



_Top: An artist’s drawing of a_ _**meteor**_ _shower at night_


_Bottom:_ _**Meteor**_ _Crater in Arizona formed when a_
_**meteorite**_ _hit Earth. Notice the road and buildings to the_
_left of the crater. This crater is very big!_



**Pages 32–33**

              - Turn to page **33** and point out the images on the page showing a meteor

shower and a crater.


              - Ask students to read page **32** to themselves to find the answer to the



Challenge


Students can create
questions and answers

be used during a unit

review game.



question: “What is a meteor and how can it create a crater?”


- When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students

to answer.


» A meteor is a space rock that falls to Earth. Pieces of a meteor that hit Earth are

called meteorites. Some are large enough that if they hit Earth, they can make a

large hole, or crater.

~~**COMPARING AND CONTRASTING (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Divide students into partners.


 - Tell students that they will be assigned specific pages to reread and take

notes on. Tell them they will either be rereading about asteroids, comets, or
meteors.


 - Tell them to write details and notes on a blank sheet of paper.


 - Let students work with partners for about 10 minutes.


 - Next, draw a triple Venn diagram on the board or use the previously

prepared one.


 - Explain how this diagram is used to compare and contrast three different

things. Explain how each intersection works, including the center shape,
which means that all three things share the same characteristics or facts.


 - Tell students they will be creating a triple Venn diagram in small groups using

the information they gathered with their partners.


 - Regroup students so each group has an asteroid pair, a comet pair, and a

meteor pair.


 - Give each of these small groups a piece of chart paper and some markers.


 - Tell students that they will use the notes that they took during their partner

work to complete a triple Venn diagram.


 - Allow students to work on their diagrams for about 10 minutes.

  - Tell students that in their writing, their sentences should be detailed enough

to be interesting to readers. Interesting and informative sentences include
descriptive words and phrases.


  - Remind them they have practiced writing, or building, more interesting and

informative sentences by including adjectives, adverbs, and other interesting
words in sentences.


  - Remind students that adjectives describe nouns, and adverbs describe

verbs.


  - Write the following sentence on chart paper or the board in cursive, asking

students to read the sentence aloud:


The fish swam.


  - Tell students that while this sentence is a complete sentence, it is not a very

interesting sentence and does not provide much information.


  - Continue by saying that you will show them how they can make a more

interesting sentence by adding adjectives and adverbs.


  - One way to make the sentence more interesting would be to add an adjective
or two to describe the fish. Ask students to brainstorm words that could be
used to describe the fish, prompting them to think of words to answer the
question, “What did the fish look like?” Write down the suggested adjectives in
a list on the board or chart paper. (Examples could be: _colorful_, _excited_, _dizzy_ .)


  - Another way to improve this sentence would be to add adverbs to describe

the verb. Ask students to brainstorm words that could be used to answer
the question, “How did the fish swim?” Write these adverbs in a separate list.
(Examples could be: _in circles_, _slowly_, _quickly_ .)


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words;
**TEKS 3.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (iv) adjectives, including their comparative and
superlative forms; (v) adverbs that convey time and adverbs that convey manner; (viii) coordinating conjunctions to form

in a separate list. (Examples could be: _in the afternoon_, _as we watched her_,
_always_ )


  - Now, ask students to brainstorm words that could be used to answer the

question, “Where did the fish swim?” Write these adverbs and/or phrases in a
separate list. (Examples could be: _in her bowl_, _at school_, _in the fish tank_ )


  - Finally, ask students to brainstorm words that could be used to answer the

question, “What happened because the fish swam?” (Examples could be: _she_
_could be noticed_, _air from the water could enter her gills_, _she could explore the_
_tank_, _children could watch her_ )


  - Remind students of cause and effect and the usage of the conjunction _so_ .
(The cause is the event that happens first, and the effect is the event that
happens second in time. The conjunction _so_ precedes the effect.) Write their
ideas for how to use _so_ on a separate list.


  - Remind students that a simple sentence is needed to show the effect of an

event.


  - Examples of more interesting sentences could be:


    - The colorful, silly fish swam in circles so she could be noticed.


    - The dizzy, blue fish swam slowly in her bowl at school so children could

watch her.


    - The excited, multi-colored fish swam in the afternoon so air from the water

could enter her gills and she could breathe.


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 5.3, explaining that they are to use the

same process to make more interesting sentences with adjectives, adverbs,
and the conjunction _so_ .


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 6, Lesson 5**

                  - Students are likely to make the following errors:


                        - For ‘g’, students may write ‘j’, ‘ge’, ‘dge’, or ‘dg’.


                        - For ‘j’, students may write ‘g’, ‘ge’, ‘dge’, or ‘dg’.


                        - For ‘ge’, students may write ‘g’, ‘j’, ‘dge’, or ‘dg’.


                        - For ‘dge’, students may write ‘g’, ‘j’, ‘ge’, or ‘dg’.


                        - For ‘dg’, students may write ‘g’, ‘j’, ‘ge’, or ‘dge’.


                 - While the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be aware

that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to
record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.
For example:


                        - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning

consonants?


                  - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


                  - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization

and punctuation.

**Grade 3 | Unit 6**

Pausing Point 1


Note to Teacher


So far in the Astronomy unit, students have been introduced to our solar
system and the objects that inhabit it. It is recommended that you pause here
and spend a day reviewing, reinforcing, or extending the material taught so far.


You may do the activities in any order or combination, using whole class or
small groups to meet the needs of the students.


~~**CORE CONTENT UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


  - Identify our sun as a star and a constant source of heat and light


  - Identify our planet Earth as the third planet from the sun and ideally suited
for life


  - Demonstrate how day and night are caused by Earth’s rotation


  - Explain why the sun seems to rise in the east and set in the west


  - Explain what happens during solar and lunar eclipses


  - Explain the reason for the seasons


  - Describe the eight planets of our solar system and their sequence from the sun


  - Describe our solar system as the sun and all of the smaller bodies that orbit,
or revolve, it; e.g., the planets, moons, asteroids


  - Describe the characteristics of a planet


  - Explain that Pluto has been reclassified as a dwarf planet


  - Describe the asteroid belt and its location in the solar system


  - Compare and contrast asteroids, meteoroids, and comets


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Image Review**


Materials: Digital Flip Book Images from Lessons 1–5


  - Project the Digital Flip Book Images from any Read-Aloud again and have
students retell the Read-Aloud using the images.


Pausing Point 1 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**107**


**Greetings from Planet** **!**


Materials: Readers, plain paper, markers, colored pencils or crayons


                 - Have students create a postcard from one of the eight planets. On the front
they will draw a picture of the planet, and on the back of the postcard they
will write a brief message to a friend or family member as if they were visiting
the planet. The back should have space for the message and space for the
address where they are sending the postcard. The address should include
not only the regular address but the planet as well.


**Poster Session**


Materials: chart paper, markers


                 - Divide students into small groups. Let each group decide on a key idea or
concept from their reading that can be visualized on a poster. Students
can use words or pictures to describe the concept. When the posters are
complete, hang them up around the room and allow students to walk around
to view and discuss the posters.


**Act It Out!**


Materials: Digital Image U6.L1.6 Solar Eclipse; Lunar Eclipse


                 - Ask students to define the terms _solar eclipse_ and _lunar eclipse_ . Have three
student volunteers participate in acting out a solar eclipse. Ask students
which celestial bodies, or natural objects seen in space, are involved in a
solar eclipse. (the moon, Earth, the sun) Appoint each student to act as
one of these three celestial bodies. Project Image U6.L1.6 before having the
volunteers act out a solar eclipse. Have student volunteers explain orally
what happens during a solar eclipse. (The moon passes between the sun
and Earth and blocks the sunlight from reaching Earth.) Next, have three
volunteers act out a lunar eclipse. Have student volunteers explain orally
what happens during a lunar eclipse. (Earth passes between the sun and
the moon; it blocks the sun’s light from reaching the moon; the moon is in
Earth’s shadow.)


**Riddles 1**


Materials: paper, pencil


                 - Have students create and exchange riddles to review everything they’ve
learned about the solar system so far. For example, “I orbit, or revolve, the
third planet from the sun. What am I?” (the moon)


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**108**


**Riddles 2**


Materials: none


  - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:

    - I provide all the heat and energy for the Earth. What am I? (the sun)


    - I am the fourth planet from the sun. What am I? (Mars)


    - I am made up of the sun, and all eight planets, including Earth, as well as
other celestial bodies. What am I? (solar system)


    - I consist of thousands of asteroids that orbit, or revolve, the sun and lie
between Mars and Jupiter. What am I? (the asteroid belt)


    - I occur when Earth’s shadow darkens the face of the moon. What am I?
(a lunar eclipse)


    - I have three different names, depending on where I am found. I am also
known as a “shooting star” when I blaze through Earth’s atmosphere. What
am I? (a meteor, meteoroid, or meteorite)


    - I orbit, or revolve, a planet. I can be natural, like the moon, or made by
humans. What am I? (a satellite)


**Compare and Contrast**


Materials: paper, pencil


  - Have students compare and contrast two planets in our solar system by
creating their own graphic organizer.


**RAFT Writing**


Materials: paper, pencil, whiteboard or chart paper


Students will complete a RAFT writing activity as described below.


Writing Prompt: Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Do you
think it should be called a planet again?


  - Go through the RAFT with students so they understand the task. Write the
letters _RAFT_ on the board. Explain to students:


Pausing Point 1 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**109**


R— **Role** of the writer. Who are you?


A—Who is the **audience** ?


F—In what **format** are you writing? Letter? Diary? Newspaper article?


T—What **topic** are you writing about?


 - Tell students to write the letters _RAFT_ going down from the top of their paper

and fill in each of the categories next to the letters.


 - Alternately, provide some of the categories for the students. For example, for
the letter ‘F’, write _letter_ so the students know the format they will be writing in.


**Planet Poetry** ~~**TEKS 3.12.A**~~


Materials: paper, pencil


 - Have students create an acrostic poem using letters from one of the celestial
bodies in our solar system. For example:


**M—meteoroids**


**E—exploding**


**T—twinkle**


**E—elliptical**


**O—orbit**


**R—rocky**


Students can also choose another word from the Astronomy unit or write a
different type of poem.


**Multiple-Meaning Word Activity: Debris**



Materials: chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard; various images depicting
_
meanings of _debris_ (/d *bre /)



**Note:** You may wish to have students find, cut out, and mount pictures

portraying the various meanings of the word _debris_ —material from objects in

space, leftover material from broken or destroyed things, and material that is

thrown away.


**TEKS 3.12.A** Compose literary texts, including personal narratives and poetry, using genre characteristics and craft.


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**110**


- In the Read-Aloud “Our Solar System, Part I” you heard, “Meteoroids are



space debris made of rock or metal that range in size from tiny pebbles to
large boulders.” Using the context of this sentence as a clue, who can tell me
what the word _debris_ means? (Pause for students to share.) Here, _debris_
means bits and pieces of leftover dust and rocks.
_

- Say the word _debris_ (/d *bre /) with me.




  - _Debris_ also means something else. It is what remains when something

is broken down or destroyed, such as buildings, cars, or trees, as in this
sentence: “Debris covered the road after the mudslide.”


  - A third meaning for _debris_ is something that is discarded or thrown away,

such as litter or garbage, as in this sentence: “After the parade, there was
debris scattered all over the sidewalks.”


  - One at a time, hold up the variety of pictures that show the different

meanings of the word _debris_ . As you show each one, call on students to form
complete sentences to share. Remind them to be as descriptive as possible.
Record the sentences on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard.


**Independent Reading**


Materials: assortment of books about astronomy


  - Have students read additional trade books about astronomy in your
classroom or from the library. After reading, have the students write a book
review that includes the following:


    - The title and author.


    - Why did you choose the book?


    - A brief summary.


    - Your favorite part.


    - What do you really want a reader to know about this book?


    - Would you recommend the book to others? Why?

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Language**

                 - Prepare to display the previous chart prepared for conjunctions by adding

the fifth bullet to the chart:


**Conjunctions**


**Conjunctions** are words that connect other words or groups of words.


                        - The **conjunction** _**and**_ connects words or groups of words. It means “plus,
along with,” or “also.”


                        - The **conjunction** _**but**_ is used to connect groups of words. It signals that
“something different,” such as a different idea, will come after _but_ .


                        - The **conjunction** _**because**_ is used to mean “for this reason” and signals
the answer to a “why” question. It signals the cause of something.


                        - The **conjunction** _**so**_ means “then this happened” and signals the effect in
a cause and effect sentence.


                        - The **conjunction** _**or**_ signals a choice, possibility, or alternative.


                  - Write the following sentences on the board in cursive:


1. I will have carrots for a snack, and I will eat a sandwich for lunch.


2. I will have carrots for a snack, or I will eat a sandwich for lunch.


3. Uncle Fred watches TV on Sunday afternoons, and he reads the newspapers.


4. Uncle Fred watches TV on Sunday afternoons, or he reads newspapers.

and stars.


                  - Tell students to read **pages 34–35** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “Our sun is a star, so why do the stars in the night sky look different
from the sun?”


                 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer.


» The night stars are much, much farther away from Earth than the sun. If we could

get close to the stars, they would look bigger, brighter, and more like the sun.


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**118**


**Pages 36–37**


“What have astronomers discovered about how stars differ from each other?”


» They can be different sizes and colors. Some are closer to Earth than others.

Some are hotter than others. The hottest stars and the stars that are closest to

Earth appear brighter.


  - Direct students’ attention to the image and caption on **page 37** .


  - Tell students to work with their partners to fill out the boxes on Activity

**Astronomers** also discovered that stars **cluster**
together in large groups. A large group of stars that
**cluster** together in one area is called a **galaxy** _._ There are
**billions** and **billions** of stars in one **galaxy** . That’s a lot
of stars!


The **galaxy** to which our sun and **solar system**
belong is called the **Milky Way Galaxy** . It has a **spiral**
shape when viewed from space. From Earth, it looks like
a “milky” band of white light.

**Lesson 6: Galaxies and Stars**

Language

~~**GRAMMAR: CONJUNCTION OR (20 MIN.)**~~



40M



**Primary Focus:** Students will combine sentences using the conjunctions _and_ and

_or_ . ~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.11.D.viii; TEKS 3.11.D.x**~~


**Introducing Conjunction or** ~~**TEKS 3.11.D.viii**~~

                 - Draw students’ attention to the Conjunctions poster and read it with them.


**Conjunctions**


**Conjunctions** are words that connect other words or groups of words.


The **conjunction** _**and**_ connects words or groups of words. It means “plus,
along with,” or “also.”


                         - The **conjunction** _**but**_ is used to connect groups of words. It signals that
“something different,” such as a different idea, will come after _but_ .


                         - The **conjunction** _**because**_ is used to mean “for this reason” and signals
the answer to a “why” question. It signals the cause of something.


                         - The **conjunction** _**so**_ means “then this happened” and signals the effect

in a cause and effect sentence.


                         - The **conjunction** _**or**_ signals a choice, possibility, or alternative.


                - Remind students the conjunction _and_ means “plus,” “along with,” or “also.”


                  - Tell students that today, they will learn a new conjunction that signals a
choice, possibility, or alternative. This conjunction is _or_ .


                 - Read the first two sentences you wrote on the board in advance.


1. I will have carrots for a snack, and I will eat a sandwich for lunch.


2. I will have carrots for a snack, or I will eat a sandwich for lunch.


                  - Point out that in these sentences, the words that are being joined are
independent clauses, forming compound sentences.


                 - Point out that the difference between the two sentences is the conjunction,
which changes the meaning of the entire sentence.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words;
**TEKS 3.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (viii) coordinating conjunctions to form compound
subjects, predicates, and sentences; (x) punctuation marks, including apostrophes in contractions and possessives and
commas in compound sentences and items in a series.

Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**124**


  - Point out that in the first sentence, I will have carrots and a sandwich, but in
the second sentence, I will have one but not both.


  - Note for students that in a series (a group of listed items), if there are
three items listed, you need two commas separating them. The items
are all separated by commas and the last comma comes just before the
conjunction. Point to the commas as you reread the sentences.


  - Draw students’ attention to the next set of sentences you wrote on the board
in advance.


1. Uncle Fred watches TV on Sunday afternoons, and he reads the newspapers.


2. Uncle Fred watches TV on Sunday afternoons, or he reads newspapers.


  - Point out that in these sentences, the words that are being joined are simple
sentences, forming compound sentences.


  - Point out that the conjunctions change the meanings of the sentences.


  - In the first sentence, the conjunction _and_ shows that Uncle Fred does both things.


  - In the second sentence, Uncle Fred either watches TV on Sunday afternoons
_or_ he reads the newspaper. Both events do not happen, only one.


  - Give students a few minutes to come up with their own compound sentences
that use the conjunction _or_, showing a choice.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


  - Have a few students share their sentences aloud. Write their sentences on
the board in cursive.


  - Note for students that if there are three things in a series, two commas are needed
(one between the first two items and the second before the conjunction _or_ ).


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 6.4. Complete this as a teacherguided activity.


~~**SPELLING (20 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will read and write words with multiple sound-spelling

patterns. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.A.i; TEKS 3.2.B.iv; TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


**Introduce Spelling Words**

  - Review targeted sounds _kn_, _gn_, _n_, as well as explicity teach Challenge Words
_very_ and _vary_ .


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words;
**TEKS 3.2.A.i** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling
patterns such as eigh, ough, and en; **TEKS 3.2.B.iv** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by: spelling multisyllabic

                 - Display the chart with the words written for students to check and correct
their words.


                 - Point to the Challenge Words on the board. Explain to students that the
Challenge Words _very_ / _vary_ and _enough_ are also part of the spelling list and
are words used very often. _Very_ / _vary_ do not follow the spelling patterns for
this week, while _enough_ does, as the ‘n’ is pronounced /n/.


                  - Explain to students that _very_ and _vary_ are homophones. Homophones sound
alike but have different meanings. Homophones may or may not be spelled the
same. _Very_ and _vary_ have the same sound /air/ and have different meanings.
_Very_ means “much” or “a lot” and _vary_ means “to change something.”


                 - Use the Challenge Words in sentences as examples for students: “It would
help me _very_ much if you would _vary_ our camp activities today.” “We have
_enough_ ice cream for everyone here to have a bowlful.”


                  - Remind students that this week, they once again have a Content Word: _astronomer_ .


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

  - Practice the words as follows during the remaining time: Call on a student
to read any word on the table. Then have the student use the word in a
meaningful sentence. After the student says the sentence, have them ask
the class: “Does the sentence make sense?” If the class says yes, then the
student puts a check mark in front of the word and calls on another student
to come to the front and take a turn. If the class says no, have the student
try again or call on another student to come to the front and use the word in

  - Have students turn to Activity Page 7.1.


  - Tell students that today their Read-Aloud will be different because they will
be silently reading along with you as you read the text aloud.


  - Explain that while they are reading, they will be _annotating_ their text.


1. Can anyone tell me what the word _annotate_ means?


» It means “to mark up” and “make notes in a text.”


2. What do you think the root word in _annotate_ is?


» the word _note_ or _notation_


  - Tell students that they will be making notes right on their text.


  - Show students the chart you made previously:


CIRCLE key ideas, words, and phrases.


UNDERLINE words or phrases you do not understand.


WRITE important thoughts, ideas, or questions in the margins.


  - Go through the chart with students and tell them that these are the three
items they will be annotating in their text.


  - Distribute highlighters or pens.


  - If you wish, the students can copy the annotation chart on the top of Activity

do you want to see more closely what lies in the center? Before you

can understand what lies beyond our solar system, you need to know

a little more about what stars are. And the best place to start is with

the star that lies at the center of our solar system that you see every

day: our very own sun.


- Model for students how they should be annotating their text. Go through
the text and give students examples of parts you would circle or underline.
Tell students one thought that you might write in the margin would be “I
wonder what stars are made of.” Give students time to finish annotating
this paragraph.


**Show Image U6.L7.2**
Our Sun, One of Billions of Stars


The sun is so much brighter and

bigger than all the rest of the stars

because we are so much closer to





our star than we are to any other star.

We only see our star, the sun, in the



daytime because that’s when we’re facing it. And when the sun lights

up our skies, it is so bright that we can’t usually see any other stars in

the daytime even though they are still there.


You can tell just by looking that there is no way a spaceship could

land on the sun—it’s a big mass of incredibly hot gas! There’s no solid

surface to land on. The sun, like all stars, is made mostly of a gas

called hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms in the center of the sun crash into

as needed.



each other under intense heat and pressure. The hydrogen **atoms fuse**,

or join together, to form another gas called helium, and this **fusion**

creates energy you can see and feel in the form of light and heat. So,

hydrogen turning into helium produces vast amounts of energy and is

what causes the sun to shine.


The amount of heat and light being produced by a star determines its

color. The surface of our sun is about ten thousand degrees Fahrenheit, not

nearly as hot as the inside of the star! Even though ten thousand degrees

is really hot compared to boiling water, our sun is still only considered a

medium-hot, yellow star. Some stars are even hotter and some are not as

hot as our sun. In fact, our sun is not as hot as it used to be.


~~Ask students to stop for a moment to finish annotating what they’ve~~

~~read so far. Provide a model for margin notes, if needed; e.g.,~~ ~~“Do stars~~

~~that are hotter than our sun look different?”~~


Scientists think that all stars are made of more or less the same

things: hydrogen, helium, and smaller amounts of other basic

substances. But just because stars are made from huge amounts of

hydrogen and helium doesn’t mean that all stars are the same—they

aren’t. The amount of substance or mass that makes up each star can

vary. And the substances that make up some stars are more packed

together than in others.


Stars have different ages, too. Some stars in the universe were

literally just born yesterday, and some—like the sun—are thought to

be **billions** of years old. But our sun is not at the end of its life either;

many scientists think our sun still has **billions** of years yet to live! So

stars can be very different from each other.


Our sun seems large to us, and it is. In fact, it’s so large that more than

one million Earths could fit inside it! That’s a lot of Earths—and just

one Earth is pretty big. But believe it or not, our sun is small compared

to many other stars. There are stars in the universe that are 2,000

times as big as the sun! Our sun seems very bright to us, and it is. But

there are stars that are more than four million times as bright! Even

so, there are stars that are smaller than our sun and some that are

less bright. So you see, stars can differ in size, mass, color, brightness,



Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond

temperature, and age. But the one thing that most stars have in

common is that they exist in groups called galaxies.


~~Allow students a few moments to finish annotating this portion of the~~

~~text.~~ ~~Ask a few students to share some of their margin notes.~~

Galaxy Shapes


Do you remember how we defined

our solar system as a neighborhood

of planets, asteroids, and other





objects in orbit around a star? Well, a


|Col1|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|||**U6.L7.3**|



galaxy is a **cluster** of many stars that revolve around together as an

even bigger neighborhood—like a country. So, a galaxy is basically a

gigantic country of stars. But all galaxies are not the same; they come

in many shapes and sizes. Some galaxies are **spiral** .


~~Point to the two spiral galaxies.~~


Some galaxies are elliptical in shape.


~~Ask,~~ ~~“Who remembers what~~ ~~_elliptical_~~ ~~means?”(~~ ~~_Shaped like a slightly_~~

Still other galaxies are **irregular** in shape, with no particular pattern.


~~Point to the image in the lower right corner.~~

The Milky Way in Our Night Sky


The galaxy that our solar system is

which is a **spiral** galaxy. When you

are standing on Earth you are in the



**Milky Way Galaxy** . If you look up into the sky on a very clear, dark

night away from the lights of a city, you can see a narrow band of

thousands of stars going through the sky. When you look at this



Lesson 7 Compare and Contrast: Galaxies
**137**


cloudy-looking band, you are looking into the thickest, densest part

of the **Milky Way** . The ancient Greeks called this band of stars the

Milky Circle, and the ancient Romans called it the Milky Road. But

guess what? When you stand outside of the Milky Way and look at it,

it looks like a **spiral** .


**Show Image U6.L7.5**
Spiral-Shaped Galaxy Similar to the
Milky Way


This is a view of a spiral galaxy like

the **Milky Way**, looking down on it.





Astronomers know what the Milky



Way Galaxy looks like, but no person or spaceship has ever traveled

outside of the Milky Way to take a picture of the whole galaxy.

Scientists have figured out by using modern scientific instruments

that the Milky Way is a **spiral** galaxy and looks very much like other

**spiral** galaxies that we can take pictures of.


As you can see, this **spiral** galaxy has a bright center, or hub, of many

bright stars with star-studded arms swirling out from it amid clouds

of gas.


How many stars do you think are in one galaxy? A single galaxy

usually contains between one **billion** and a few hundred **billion** stars.

And that’s not even counting any planets or other objects that may

be in orbit around all of those **billions** of stars. In addition to **billions**

of stars, galaxies also contain clouds of gas and pieces of dust, which

can eventually come together to form new stars.


And don’t forget—galaxies also include the space in between the

stars that are in it. There is a huge amount of space in space! Stars

in the Milky Way Galaxy can be 100,000 **light-years** away from each

other, or they can be five **light-years** away from each other, but most

are somewhere in-between.


A **light-year** is the distance that light travels in one year. Light travels

at a speed of 186,282 miles per second. So one light-year is nearly


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**138**


six trillion miles! That’s about 6,000 **billion** miles. And you thought a

**billion** was big! Well, as you can see, stars in the same galaxy are very

far away from each other. Those are **astronomical** distances!


~~Ask students to share some of the words or phrases they’ve underlined.~~


**Show Image U6.L7.6**
Gathering Information about Space


Astronomers use different kinds of

powerful telescopes to see even more

distant parts of the Milky Way Galaxy.





Some of those telescopes are on



Earth, and some are in orbit around Earth. And there are even a few

telescopes zooming through our solar system.


Astronomers share their observations, their photographs, and the

data they have gathered with each other—and luckily, with us, too.

Even with all of our powerful equipment, there are still things in

the Milky Way Galaxy—and beyond it—that no one has ever seen.

Sometimes there is something in the way, like a star or another

galaxy, and some things are still too far away even for our most

powerful telescopes. There are more stars and galaxies in the

universe than we can imagine!


~~Ask students to share some of the key ideas, words, and phrases that~~

~~they have circled.~~

The Andromeda Galaxy


As you look out at the Milky Way, you

may wonder about the other galaxies

out there. One of the closest galaxies





to our Milky Way Galaxy is called the

**139**


Andromeda (/an*drom* *d /) Galaxy. The Andromeda Galaxy is

a **spiral** galaxy like our Milky Way. Even though Andromeda is the

closest **spiral** galaxy to our galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy is still

very far away, and there is still much that remains unknown about

it. Several other small **irregular** galaxies lie between the Milky Way

Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy.

You may be thinking about all of the

**Primary Focus:** Students will decode words using knowledge of suffixes _-ful_ and

_-less._ ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.A.vi ]**~~

Students will add suffixes _-ful_ and _-less_ to change the meaning of words. ~~**[ TEKS 3.3.C ]**~~


**Practice Suffixes –ful and –less** ~~**TEKS 3.2.A.vi; TEKS 3.3.C**~~

                  - Remind students that the suffix _–ful_ means “full of” and the suffix _–less_
means “lacking.” When these suffixes are added to nouns, the new words are
adjectives.


                 - Also, remind students that when these suffixes are added to the same root
word, the words have opposite meanings. (Example: _Careless_ and _careful_
are opposites.)


                  - Write a few words with _-ful_ and _-less_ on the board.


                  - Model decoding the words by first isolating the suffix, then isolating the
vowel in the base word, and then reading the word.


                 - Have students come up and decode the remaining words using the same process.


                  - As students decode the words, discuss the meaning of each word, how the suffix
changes the meaning, and why it is important to note that when reading a text.


                 - Read aloud the sentences that you prepared in advance, and tell students to

write the correct word on a piece of notebook paper to practice spelling the
words that will fit in the blanks.


                  - Throughout the activity, circulate, observe, and provide corrective and
informative feedback as necessary.


                 - Read aloud the first sentence that you prepared in advance:


1. The young child was off to the barber shop for the first time and was very
afraid that his first haircut would be pain .


**TEKS 3.2.A.vi** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of suffixes, including how
they can change base words such as dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling final consonants; **TEKS 3.3.C** Identify the
meaning of and use words with affixes such as im- (into), non-, dis-, in- (not, non), pre-, -ness, -y, and -ful.


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**142**


  - Give students time to write the word on their paper. Ask students, “Which word
correctly complete the sentence, painful or painless?”


» painful


  - Once students have given the correct answer, ask, “Why wouldn’t the word

_painless_ make sense in this sentence?”


» _Painless_ means “lacking pain,” and a young child likely wouldn’t be afraid of

something without pain.


  - Read aloud the second sentence that you prepared in advance:


2. I made a care mistake and spilled my grape juice on my favorite
white shirt.


  - Give students time to write the word on their paper. Ask students, “Which word
correctly completes the sentence, careful or careless?”


» careless


  - Once students have given the correct answer, ask, “Why wouldn’t the word

_careful_ make sense in this sentence?”


» _Careful_ means “full of effort to do something correctly and safely,” and a person

would likely not make the mistake of spilling grape juice on a favorite shirt by

doing something correctly and safely.


  - Read aloud the third sentence that you prepared in advance:


3. The power storm included strong winds that knocked trees and
power lines down.


  - Give students time to write the word on their paper. Ask students, “Which word
correctly completes the sentence, powerful or powerless?”


» powerful


  - Once students have given the correct answer, ask, “Why wouldn’t the word

_powerless_ make sense in this sentence?”


» _Powerless_ means “lacking the strength or authority to do something,” and a storm

that knocks down trees and power lines is not lacking strength.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Speaking and Listening**

                 - Prepare to project the following Digital Flip Book Images during the ReadAloud:
U6.L8.1–U6.L8.7.

**Language**

                  - Prepare to display the conjunctions chart:


**Conjunctions**


**Conjunction** are words that connect other words or groups of words.


                         - The **Conjunction and** connects words or groups of words. It means
“plus, along with,” or “also.”


                         - The **Conjunction but** is used to connect groups of words. It signals that
“something different,” such as a different idea, will come after _but_ .


                         - The **Conjunction because** is used to mean “for this reason” and signals

                     - the answer to a “why” question. It signals the cause of something.


                         - The **Conjunction so** means “then this happened” and signals the effect
in a cause and effect sentence.


                 - Prepare sentence strips with the following for use in the Grammar lesson.


1. The forecast said rain today.


2. Joseph took his umbrella with him.


3. Samantha’s favorite sandwich is peanut butter and jelly.


4. Her mother packs it in her lunch almost every day.

online materials during the Read-Aloud: U6.L8.1–U6.L8.7.


                 - Ask students to recall what they learned about constellations from reading
Chapter 7, “Constellations.”


                - Show students Image Card C.U6.L8.1 (Orion and His Hunting Dogs).


                 - Ask students if they see any shapes in this well-known group of stars and
allow students to share ideas.


                 - Say to students: “Perhaps you have observed a very hot flame, maybe on a
gas stove or a Bunsen burner, and noticed that different parts of the flame
have different colors. The blue and white parts of the flame are much hotter
than the yellow or red parts. This is the same for stars: blue and bluish-white
stars are the hottest; white stars are very hot; yellow stars (like our sun) are
medium hot; and red stars are the least hot.”


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**150**


 - Tell students that this image has some interesting stars. Point out the large,
white star, Sirius, and tell students that this is the very brightest star in our
sky. Point to the reddish star and ask students if they have ever heard of
the star Betelgeuse (/b¯et*’l*jooz/). Tell students that this star is one of the
brightest in our night sky because it is both very large and fairly close to us—
in astronomical distances! Explain that Betelgeuse is red because it is not a
very hot star anymore; Betelgeuse is a dying star that is starting to cool off.
Tell students that astronomers predict that Betelgeuse will eventually explode
and that it will be so hot and bright that we will be able to see it during the
daytime. (Explain that stars become hotter again once they die and explode
or implode.)


 - Point out the bluish-white star. Tell students that this star is called Rigel (/rl*j l/)

and that it, too, is a very big star. Explain that because of its size and very hot
temperature, it is one of our sky’s brightest stars. Tell students that the blue star
Bellatrix is one of the very hottest stars.


 - As you read, model appropriate rate and prosody for students. While reading,
make sure to pay careful attention to the types of sentences (exclamatory,
declarative, interrogative) and reflect that in your tone. Make sure to model full
stops at periods and pauses at commas. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~

It’s time for us to head back home to

planet Earth. From our home, we can

see glimpses of space by looking up

into the sky. After our journey, perhaps





you won’t see the stars as just little



twinkling lights in the sky anymore. Now you know they are like our

sun, the star that is the center of our solar system. You know that up

close, stars are really massive powerhouses of super-hot gas.

Looking Up at the Night Sky


The next time you look up into the

night sky, perhaps you will study the

stars in a new way. They all look about

the same size from where you stand



on Earth, but you know they’re not. They are different sizes. Some are

brighter than others, and some are hotter than others. Maybe you once

thought the stars in the sky were pretty close together, but after taking

a ride in our special classroom spaceship, you remember that even

though stars look close together in the sky, they are really very, very,

very far apart. It’s true that stars cluster together to form galaxies.

Even when they are clustered together, most stars are still incredibly

far apart from other stars in the same galaxy. And they are even farther

apart from the stars of other galaxies. There’s a lot of space in space!


**Show Image U6.L8.3**
The Andromeda Galaxy


Look up at the sky and try to count the

stars. There are a lot of them!





On a clear evening, depending on where

you are, you can see many of the 2,000



or so stars that can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. All the stars

you see are in our own Milky Way Galaxy. You can’t see individual stars

from other galaxies without the use of a telescope. But, looking between

the stars of our galaxy, you may be able to see the distant Andromeda

Galaxy if it’s a very dark night and you know just where to look.


~~Ask students to recall what they learned about the Andromeda~~

~~Galaxy (~~ ~~_closest to the Milky Way, spiral-shaped, very far away_~~ ~~)~~


For thousands and thousands and thousands of years, people

have been looking up at the night sky—just like you. Human beings

have tried to understand the location of the stars and predict their


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**152**


positions each night in the sky. In the grand scheme of the universe,

it is human nature for us to try to understand why things are the way

they are and where we fit in.









**Show Image U6.L8.4**
Night Sky Showing Constellations


Since ancient times, people have

grouped the stars into patterns called

constellations. Ancient civilizations

saw these constellations as figures of







people, animals, and objects. They played “connect the dots” with the stars

by drawing imaginary lines between them to form pictures in the sky.


~~Ask students what constellations they already know. Answers will~~

~~vary, but students who participated in the program in Grade 1 may be~~

~~familiar with Scorpio and Taurus.~~


These pictures often told familiar mythological stories about heroes

like the Greek hunter, Orion, who stands ready with his shield to fight a

bull. They were about mythological animals like Pegasus, the beautiful

winged horse. And they were about animals such as Canis Major and

Canis Minor. _Canis_ means “dog” in Latin and _major_ means “greater.”


If Canis Major is commonly known as the Great Dog, it’s easy to see

who might be following behind. In the stories about Orion the great

hunter, these two constellations are Orion’s faithful hunting dogs, forever

following at the heels of their master as they move through the night sky.


The very brightest star in our sky, Sirius (/sir*¯e* s/), is in the

constellation Canis Major and is often called the Dog Star. Sirius is a

very large star compared to our sun and one of the closest stars to

our solar system—only a little over eight and a half light-years away!


~~Show Image Card C.U6.L8.1 (Orion and His Hunting Dogs). Point to the~~

~~stars as you say, “Here is Betelgeuse, which forms Orion’s right shoulder,~~

~~and bluish-white Rigel, which forms Orion’s left foot. This bluish star in~~

~~Orion’s left shoulder is Bellatrix (/b l*¯a*trix/), a very hot young star.~~


Lesson 8 Constellations and Stars
**153**


People who live in Earth’s Northern Hemisphere see a different set

of constellations than people in Earth’s Southern Hemisphere do.

Only people in the Northern Hemisphere can see those constellations

above Earth’s North Pole. Only people in the Southern Hemisphere

can see those above Earth’s South Pole. However, the constellations

above Earth’s equator can be seen from both hemispheres. Maybe

someday you’ll cross the equator, travel to another part of the world, and

experience the constellations of the night sky from another point of view!

**Show Image U6.L8.5**
Polaris and the Big and Little Dippers


Since ancient times, people have

noticed that the stars in the sky and

the familiar constellations move in a

predictable and interesting way. All of

the stars in the sky move in a circular

pattern around one point.



~~Show Image Card C.U6.L8.2 (Stars Circling Polaris). Say,“This time-lapse~~

~~photograph was taken over a period of time during a dark night. Can~~

~~someone point to the part of the sky around which all the other stars circle?~~


In the Northern Hemisphere, the half of planet Earth north of the

equator, there is a star located very near that point in the sky that we

call the North Star, or Polaris (/p¯o*lar*is/). Even though all the rest of

the stars in the sky change their positions throughout the night, the

North Star is always located almost directly north.


Knowing this has helped sailors and travelers in the Northern

Hemisphere for thousands of years to orient themselves.


Long before modern navigational tools like compasses and GPS were

invented, sailors relied on the star Polaris. Technology has advanced

a great deal since those days, so much so that some people like to

participate in a modern sporting competition known as orienteering

where they use magnetic compasses and GPS to orient themselves

and accomplish a task or goal. You might remember from an earlier



Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**154**


lesson that the earth has a North Pole and a South Pole. These poles

act like a magnet. A magnetic compass works because of the earth’s

magnetic field. A GPS is a modern device that uses man-made

satellites revolving the earth to find and tell your position on Earth.


Two patterns of stars you may already be familiar with that are visible

in the Northern Hemisphere are the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper.

Each one looks like a ladle in the sky. The Big Dipper and the Little

Dipper are not the official names of the constellations themselves

but are part of two very famous larger constellations. The Big Dipper

is a group of stars that is part of the constellation Ursa Major, which

means “Greater Bear” in Latin. The Little Dipper is a smaller group of

stars that is part of the constellation Ursa Minor.


~~Ask a volunteer to point to the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper in~~

~~the image.~~


Suppose it is a dark, starry night and you are trying to find your way

through the countryside. You can look up into the night sky and find

the Little Dipper. The last star on its handle is the brightest star in

the constellation.


You just heard about this star named Polaris. It is called Polaris because

it is almost directly above the earth’s North Pole. Once you find Polaris,

you can find north simply by facing this star. When you are facing north,

your back is to the south. Your right side is to the east, and your left side

is to the west. Now all you have to do is decide which direction to go!


~~Ask students if they know another name for Polaris. (~~ ~~_the North Star_~~ ~~)~~


Sometimes the Big Dipper is easier to see than the Little Dipper. You

can also use the Big Dipper to find the North Star.


~~Ask a volunteer to point to the stars in the image as you read the~~

~~following two sentences.~~


Just line up the two stars, called the “Pointer Stars,” opposite the

handle of the Big Dipper’s bowl and draw a line through them. The

line points up out of the bowl of the Big Dipper right to the North Star

on the tip of the Little Dipper’s handle!


Lesson 8 Constellations and Stars
**155**


And if you’ve got the North Star—Polaris—to point you in the right

direction, who needs a GPS? People have been using the stars to

navigate, or find their way, for thousands of years. People who live in the

Northern Hemisphere today can still see these and other constellations

when they look up in the sky at night. The enslaved people who escaped

before the time of the U.S. Civil War saw the ladle in the sky and sang a

song telling them to “follow the drinking gourd” north to freedom.


Throughout history, people in different cultures have looked up at the

Big Dipper and have seen other pictures besides the famous water

dipper. In one Greek myth, or story, about Ursa Major, the jealous

goddess Hera, wife of Zeus, turns a maiden named Callisto into a

bear. Then, to protect Callisto the Bear, Zeus placed her in the sky as

a constellation. An Arabian myth describes a coffin that is followed by

three mourners. One Native American group saw a bear being followed

by three hunters, one of them carrying the pan in which to cook the

bear meat. The Norse people of northern Europe saw Odin’s wagon.



**Show Image U6.L8.6**
Constellations of the Southern Hemisphere Skies


But what do you see if you live in the

Southern Hemisphere? People who

live south of the equator in places like







Chile, South Africa, and Australia see a different set of constellations

than people in the Northern Hemisphere in places like the United

States, Canada, Norway, Turkey, and China. On the other side of the

world, as they rotate around the South Pole, people look out into the

stars of the Milky Way Galaxy from a different direction than people

north of the equator do.


~~Use a globe and show how people who live in countries south of the~~

~~equator would look out into a different part of the sky than people in~~

~~the countries north of the equator.~~


You might be surprised to learn that there is no star directly over the

South Pole! There is no South Star around which the rest of the stars


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**156**


circle. But there is a small constellation—named Octans—very close by

that circles around the spot where a South Star would be, if it was there!

Octans resembles an octant, an early instrument used for navigation.


~~Ask students why they think ancient people may have pictured an~~

~~octant in this part of the sky. (~~ ~~_Both the constellation and the tool were_~~

~~_used to help people navigate_~~ ~~.)~~


Not too far away is another constellation familiar to stargazers in the

Southern Hemisphere—the Southern Cross.


~~Point to these constellations in the image.~~











**Show Image U6.L8.7**
Night Sky Showing Constellations


Let’s review the constellations that

we have been talking about.


~~Have students repeat the name of the~~

~~constellation as you point to each one.~~







The constellations you’ve heard about today are just a few of the 88

constellations astronomers have identified in Earth’s skies. Next time

you have a chance to enjoy a dark starlit night, gaze up into the sky

and see if you can find some familiar constellations. If not, have some

fun and make up some constellations and stories of your own.


Maybe someday you’ll cross the equator, travel to another part of

the world, and experience the constellations of the night sky from

another point of view!


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What is a constellation?


» It is a group of stars in the night sky that appears to form a picture of an object,

animal, or person. Constellations often have stories that explain how they came to

be in the sky.


Lesson 8 Constellations and Stars
**157**


Activity Page 8.2



2. **Literal.** What do we call the star in the Northern Hemisphere that never

seems to move?


» Polaris, the North Star


3. **Evaluative.** How does your point of view on Earth affect what you see in

the sky?


» People in different hemispheres or parts of the world look out into space from

different angles and see different constellations during the various seasons.


4. **Literal.** What are some characteristics of stars that you heard about in this

Read-Aloud?


» Stars have different colors depending on how hot they are; stars are at different

distances from Earth; some stars appear brighter than others depending on their

size and distance from Earth.


5. **Evaluative.** What is the difference described in the Read-Aloud among blue,

white, red, and yellow stars?


» Blue stars are the hottest, white stars are very hot, yellow stars are medium hot,

and red stars are the least hot.


**Think-Pair-Share**

 - I am going to ask you a question. I will give you a minute to think about it, and
then I will ask you to turn to your neighbor and discuss the question. I’ll call
on several of you to share what you discussed with your partner.


6. **Evaluative.** Explorers and travelers have long used the stars to orient

themselves, or to find out in which direction they are traveling. For example,

people in the Southern Hemisphere use the Southern Cross to help guide

them. Explain the sequence of steps people in the Northern Hemisphere use to

find north with the help of the stars.


» First, find the Big Dipper because it is easy to see. Locate the two stars on the

right side of the dipper. These are called the pointer stars; follow them upward

until you reach a star. This is the end of the handle of the Little Dipper and it is also

the North Star, or Polaris. It is always in the north.


~~**POEM: “ESCAPE AT BEDTIME” (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 8.2.


 - Tell students that people are often inspired by the stars and constellations of
the night sky to write poetry. Tell students they are going to hear a poem titled
“Escape at Bedtime,” written by Robert Louis Stevenson in the 1800s. Explain
that the poem is about a child looking out the window at bedtime and marveling
at the stars of the night sky. Tell students to listen for the comparisons the



Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**158**


poet makes about the number of stars in the sky and to listen for the names of
celestial bodies and star patterns.


  - Read “Escape at Bedtime” aloud while students follow along on Activity Page 8.2.


**Escape at Bedtime**


**By Robert Louis Stevenson**


_The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out_

_Through the blinds and the windows and bars;_

_And high overhead and all moving about,_

_There were thousands of millions of stars._

_There ne’er were such thousands of leaves on a tree_

_Nor of people in church or the Park,_

_As the crowds of stars that looked down on me,_

_And that glittered and winked in the dark._


_The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all,_

_And the star of the sailor, and Mars,_

_These shone in the sky, and the pail by the wall_

_Would be half full of water and stars._

_They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries,_

_And soon had me packed into bed;_

_But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes,_

_And stars going round in my head._


  - Ask students what the poet compares the number of stars in the night sky to.


» leaves on a tree, people in church or the park


  - Ask students to describe these images. Are they crowded or empty? Are
they moving or still? Are they friendly, unfriendly, or something else? Explain
that **imagery** is a picture or impression a writer creates to help the reader
understand an idea or a description. ~~**[ TEKS 3.10.D ]**~~


  - Ask students if they think these images are good comparisons.


  - Ask students to share other ideas about comparisons.


  - Ask students what sounds they notice in the poem. Does it rhyme? (yes) What
is the rhyme scheme? (ABABCDCD) Which words make sounds that create
the feeling of stars? (Answers may include _glittered, winked, shone, shining,_


**TEKS 3.10.D** Describe how the author’s use of imagery, literal and figurative language such as simile, and sound devices such
as onomatopoeia achieves specific purposes.

of millions of stars.) Why might the poet use this hyperbole in the poem?
(The hyperbole helps to emphasize that the night sky is full of stars.)


  - Divide the class into small groups of three to four students each. ~~**TEKS 3.9.B**~~


  - Distribute chart paper (or large blank paper) and markers to each group.


  - Tell students that they will be doing a shared writing activity, and they will
compose their own poem comparing stars in the sky to something on Earth.


  - Remind students to follow the rules of group work and to make sure that all
members’ ideas are listened to and discussed.


  - Point out that Stevenson’s poem has two stanzas, or groups of lines, separated
by a break. Many poets use stanza breaks to signal shifts in meaning, sound, or
imagery, much as a new paragraph signals a shift in prose. Stevenson begins a
new stanza and a new group of rhymes when he introduces each constellation.
Not every poem has (or needs) a stanza break, but it can be a helpful way for
poets to organize thoughts. ~~**TEKS 3.9.B; TEKS 3.10.D**~~


  - Explain to students that their poems can be any form they choose: rhyming,
free verse, haiku, etc. Some of these forms use stanzas and rhymes, and
some do not. Remind students to use vivid and descriptive words and images
that will help paint the picture for the reader.


  - Tell students to draft their poem on blank or scrap paper first, before making
a final copy on the chart paper.


  - Circulate as groups work, making sure that all members are contributing.


  - When the students are finished, hang the poems around the room. If time
permits, have each group share their poem with the class.


**TEKS 3.9.B** Explain rhyme scheme, sound devices, and structural elements such as stanzas in a variety of poems;
**TEKS 3.10.D** Describe how the author’s use of imagery, literal and figurative language such as simile, and sound devices
such as onomatopoeia achieves specific purposes.

**Primary Focus:** Students will show cause and effect by writing sentences using the

conjunction _so_ . ~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.11.D.viii**~~


~~**GRAMMAR: CONJUNCTION SO (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.11.D.viii**~~


**Review Conjunction So**

  - Draw students’ attention to the conjunctions chart you previously prepared
and reread it with them.


**Conjunctions**


**Conjunctions** are words that connect other words or groups of words.


The **conjunction** _**and**_ connects words or groups of words. It means “plus,

along with,” or “also.”


     - The **conjunction** _**but**_ is used to connect groups of words. It signals that
“something different,” such as a different idea, will come after _but_ .


     - The **conjunction** _**because**_ is used to mean “for this reason” and signals
the answer to a “why” question. It signals the cause of something.


     - The **conjunction** _**so**_ means “then this happened” and signals the effect
in a cause and effect sentence.


     - The **conjunction** _**or**_ signals a choice, possibility, or alternative.


  - Remind students of the difference between the conjunction _because_ and the
conjunction _so_ .


» _Because_ signals the cause, while so signals the effect.


  - Divide the class into six teams and give each team one of the sentence strips
you prepared in advance. Do not pass out the strips with _Because_ and _so_
written on them.


  - Have teams stand around the classroom, all facing toward the center.


  - Have the six teams display their sentence strips so all can see them.


  - Have students determine how the six teams could be joined to become three
teams, by matching the sentence strips that go together.


  - Have the six teams move around the room to become three teams.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words;

Challenge


Have students create
their own cause and effect

sentences.




 - Call up one team at a time and have them display their two sentences with
the cause first and the effect second.


 - Now, take the sentence strip you prepared that says _Because_ and hold it in
front of the first sentence. Have the class choral read the new sentence.


**Note to Teacher:** Sentences with the conjunction _because_ are complex
sentences. Sentences with the conjunction _so_ are compound sentences.
Students do not need to recognize complex sentences at this time. However,
students should be familiar with compound sentences.


 - Ask, “Why did I place the conjunction _Because_ at the beginning of the
sentence?”


» The conjunction _because_ signals the cause.


   - Because the forecast said rain today, Joseph took his umbrella with him.


 - Next, remove the sentence strip that says _Because_ and insert the sentence
strip that says _so_ in between the two simple sentences. Have the class choral
read the new compound sentence.


   - The forecast said rain today, so Joseph took his umbrella with him.


 - Ask, “Why did I place the conjunction _so_ between the two sentences and
before the second sentence?”


» The conjunction _so_ signals the effect.


 - Repeat the process with the other two teams.


 - Remind students that the conjunction _and_ connects words or groups of
words. It means “plus,” “along with,” or “also.”


 - Remind students that the conjunction _or_ signals a choice, possibility,
or alternative.


Check for Understanding


       - Tell students you will read some sentences, leaving out the conjunction
but humming in the place where it should go.


       - Have students give a thumbs up if they would personally choose the
conjunction _and_ to be placed in the space and a thumbs down if they
would personally choose the conjunction _or_ .


       - Give an example first: “I want cookies (HUM) chocolate ice cream.”
Students may choose either _and_ (a thumbs up) or _or_ (a thumbs down),
depending on their preference. As both choices are correct, you may
wish to hear why students chose one conjunction over the other.


       - Examples for sentences to read could be:


» I like going to the movies (HUM) reading books.

Nicolaus Copernicus and the
Heliocentric View


Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish

astronomer, mathematician, and





clergyman who was studying the



night sky around the same time that Columbus arrived in America.


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level texts.


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond

Copernicus, with the help of other scientists before and after him,

changed our understandings of astronomy when he discovered that

the universe was not geocentric.


~~Ask students if they can use the parts of the word~~ ~~_geocentric_~~ ~~to fgure out~~

~~what it means.~~ ~~(Geo–~~ ~~_comes from the Greek word meaning_~~ ~~“~~ ~~_earth_~~ ~~”; –centric~~

~~_means_~~ ~~“~~ ~~_central_~~ ~~”~~ ~~_or_~~ ~~“~~ ~~_centered_~~ ~~,”~~ ~~_so_~~ ~~geocentric~~ ~~_means_~~ ~~“~~ ~~_earth-centered_~~ ~~.”)~~


How were just a handful of people able to come up with an idea

that changed the whole world? It’s quite simple, really. Copernicus

began by studying something he was really interested in: the night

sky. His interest led him to make careful observations, to ask

questions, to work hard, to study, to think logically to come up with

new answers, and to build upon the work of other scientists before

him. His willingness to ask questions—even when he had to stand

alone with his ideas—led Copernicus to make an important scientific

discovery—that our solar system is heliocentric, or sun-centered.


~~Ask students what context clues help us to understand the word part~~

~~_helio_~~ ~~–. (~~ ~~_sun-centered_~~ ~~) Tell students that they will be learning more~~

~~about Copernicus in an upcoming lesson.~~


All of science is based upon careful observations of the world, and

a willingness to ask questions about it. Asking questions allows

us to come up with new ideas. And new ideas lead to a better

understanding about how the world works. That’s what the process

of science is all about. So, whenever you observe the world around

you and ask questions about what you see, you should be proud of

yourself because you are thinking like a scientist.


  - Have students look back at Activity Page 9.1 and the first statement. Have a
volunteer read the statement, “Our solar system is geocentric” aloud.


  - Tell students to think about what they have just heard. Tell students to look
at the column to the far right. Ask, “After hearing about Copernicus, do you
think the statement is true or false?”


» false

Galileo Looking through his Telescope;
Modern Telescope


Not too many years after Copernicus

died, the telescope was invented. Galileo

was one of the first astronomers to build



and use a telescope. Very soon, many astronomers began using

telescopes to take a closer look at the stars. This gave them new

information, and so astronomers were able to learn even more about

the universe and gather more evidence that supported Copernicus’s

heliocentric theory. As you heard earlier, astronomers discovered the

planet Neptune fewer than 200 years ago, in 1846, when they were

finally able to see it with a more powerful telescope. Astronomers

continued building different types of and more powerful telescopes,

which led to an even better understanding of space—and more

questions about it, too! Discovering more objects similar in size to

Pluto led scientists to ask again, “How should Pluto be classified?”

With more information available, astronomers came up with a brand
new answer to that question.


~~Ask students to recall what they remember about Pluto and its new~~

~~classification. (~~ ~~_It is now called a dwarf planet because it has not_~~

~~_cleared the debris in its orbit_~~ ~~.)~~


- Tell students to go back to Activity Page 9.1 to read the next statement and
mark it as true or false: “Neptune wasn’t discovered until more powerful
telescopes were invented.”


**Show Image U6.L9.3**
Observatory; Large Telescope


Today, telescopes that astronomers use

are usually located in areas far away

from cities.





Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**170**


~~Ask students why they think telescopes are usually far away from~~

~~cities. (~~ ~~_Cities have too many lights that interfere with viewing_~~ ~~.)~~


~~Ask students to recall what they remember about telescopes from~~

~~the Light and Sound unit. (~~ ~~_Telescopes have lenses; the lenses are_~~

~~_convex to make images larger_~~ ~~.)~~


Where there are cities, there is also a lot of light. And where there

is a lot of light on Earth, it is harder to see the light of the stars.

Light made by humans that hinders or blocks our view of the stars

is called light pollution. Besides building telescopes far away from

light pollution, astronomers also like to build telescopes on high

mountains. You might think it’s so the astronomers can get closer to

the stars, but it’s not really that much closer.


An observatory is a building designed especially for observing the

stars, planets, and other space objects. Placing an observatory high

on a mountain allows astronomers to get above as much of Earth’s

atmosphere as possible. And as the Earth’s atmosphere thins out in

higher places, astronomers can more clearly look at the light of the

stars. A more powerful telescope was built for the Lowell Observatory

in Arizona for the purpose of finding Pluto. Astronomers thought

that Pluto existed before they ever saw it! There appeared to be

something in space beyond Uranus and Neptune that was exerting a

strong gravitational pull on these planets. Astronomers searched for

25 years before they finally discovered Pluto!


But there’s another way that scientists are now able to place

telescopes even higher than the highest mountain. Telescopes

are launched into space. That’s right! Scientists now use rockets

to escape Earth’s surface gravity. The power of rockets enables

spacecraft to launch telescopes into space. Once beyond Earth’s

atmosphere, the telescopes can study the universe more closely and

clearly than ever before. Some spacecraft are held in orbit around

Earth by its gravity.


Other spacecraft have ventured beyond the reach of Earth’s gravity

to explore other parts of the solar system. Telescopes and cameras

aboard the space probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have spent the

last 35 years gathering information about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,



Support


Explain that gravity is the
force of attraction between
objects that have mass.
Gravitational pull describes
the attraction that objects

gravity in another lesson.

**Show Image U6.L9.4**
Hubble Space Telescope; Images Taken
from the Hubble


Telescopes that are launched into

space are literally “out of this world”—



of the universe that are also “out of this world.” The Hubble Space

Telescope is the most famous telescope ever to be launched into

space. It was carried into orbit by a space shuttle in 1990, and it now

orbits, or revolves, about 350 miles above the surface of Earth.


~~Show Image Card C.U6.L9.1 (Space Shuttle).~~ ~~Tell students that~~

~~space shuttles are manned, winged spacecraft that carry supplies,~~

~~astronauts, and equipment into space and then return to Earth to be~~

~~used again.~~ ~~The last NASA space shuttle to fly was retired in 2011.~~


Because there is very little light pollution in orbit, and because Earth’s

atmosphere does not get in the way and cause distortion, this powerful

telescope helps scientists see deeper into the universe than ever

before. The Hubble Space Telescope has provided scientists with new

information—and fantastic pictures—about our own solar system, distant

stars, far-away galaxies, and other celestial bodies and occurrences.


New discoveries in science, such as the telescope, always lead to new

questions. For most of human history, many of the questions and





and they are able to take pictures



Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**172**


theories people had about space came from simply gazing up at the

night sky. People could look up at the moon and the planets and the

stars, but these celestial bodies were completely beyond reach. Once

humans invented a way to fly in airplanes—which was only a little

more than 100 years ago—the question soon became, “Can we fly

beyond Earth’s atmosphere, all the way into space?”


~~Tell students to read the next statement and mark true or false for~~

~~“The Hubble Space Telescope orbits, or revolves, the solar system.”~~


**Show Image U6.L9.5**
Sputnik 1; Yuri Gagarin


The exciting answer to that question

was a loud—yes! In 1957, a group of

countries, then called the Soviet Union,





which included Russia, sent the first



satellite made by humans into space. The satellite was called Sputnik 1, and

it was an aluminum sphere that was only about the size of a beach ball. This

small artificial satellite began a whole new revolution in space exploration.


Can you guess what scientists’ next question was? It was this: “If we

can send a satellite into space, can we also send a living being into

space?” A month later, Russia sent a dog named Laika (/l *k /) into

space. Laika was the first living being to ever go to space.


~~Show Image Card C.U6.L9.2 (Stamps Honoring Space Dog Laika).~~

~~Note: Laika did not survive this mission; you may or may not wish to~~

~~share this with students.~~


After Laika’s mission, several more dogs were successfully sent

into space. Can you guess what the next question was? Right! “If

we can send a dog into space, can we send a human into space?” In

1961, the Soviets again answered this question with a resounding,

enthusiastic—yes!


The first human being to go into space was Soviet cosmonaut Yuri

Gagarin aboard the spacecraft Vostok 1.

A triumphant—yes! In 1969, the United States sent three astronauts

into space—Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin.


~~Show Image Card C.U6.L9.3 (Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin)~~


These astronauts traveled to the moon in a spacecraft called Apollo 11,

which had three sections. The lunar module, or section, of the Apollo 11

was named the Eagle, and it landed on the moon with Neil Armstrong

and Buzz Aldrin aboard. Meanwhile, astronaut Michael Collins orbited the

moon in the Apollo 11 command module, which was called the _Columbia_ . A

third service module provided power, oxygen, and water.

~~There is some debate as to the actual words of this history-making~~

~~quote.~~ ~~Armstrong says that he did say the~~ ~~_a_~~ ~~before the word~~ ~~_man_~~ ~~, but~~

~~since the transmission was not completely clear, it was perceived and~~

~~believed by most that he did not say the~~ ~~_a_~~ ~~, but instead said,~~ ~~“That’s~~

~~one small step for man….” Recently, some experts who analyzed~~

~~the recording of his famous quote and his speech patterns found~~

~~evidence to support that he did say the~~ ~~_a_~~ ~~before~~ ~~_man_~~ ~~. In a biography~~

~~written about Armstrong, he is quoted as saying,~~ ~~“I think that~~

~~reasonable people will realize that I didn’t intentionally make an inane~~

~~statement and that certainly the~~ ~~_a_~~ ~~was intended, because that’s the~~

~~only way the statement makes any sense.”~~


Soon after Armstrong said these famous words, Buzz Aldrin joined

him to walk on the surface, where they bounced and hopped to get

around because of the moon’s low gravity. The astronauts had to plan

their movements six or seven steps ahead because movement on the

moon is different from movement on Earth. They also discovered that

the fine moon soil was quite slippery.


Together, Armstrong and Aldrin collected about 48 pounds of moon

rocks and brought them back to Earth to be studied. They took many

photographs and performed experiments to learn about the moon.

man to walk on the moon,” and mark it true or false.

_Columbia_ came back through Earth’s atmosphere and splashed down in

the Pacific Ocean. There are lots of pictures of the _Columbia_ in magazines

and locally approved resources, and someday if you ever visit Washington,

D.C., you can see the _Columbia_ at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.


In the past, spacecraft like the Apollo 11 were only able to fly into

space and back one time. They were not reusable. But with advances

in technology, reusable spacecraft have been developed. Reusing the

space shuttles has saved time, money, and valuable resources.


- Tell students to read the last statement on Activity Page 9.1, “The Apollo 11
space capsule was not a reusable spacecraft,” and mark true or false.

As scientists continue to explore

space in the future, we will continue to

better understand both space and the





universe. And as we continue to learn



more, you can be sure that there will be many new questions that will

be asked. Maybe you’ll be asking—and even answering—some of them!


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Why are the Sputnik 1 and the Apollo 11 trips into space

considered triumphs?


» Sputnik 1 was the first satellite to be sent into space; Apollo 11 was the first

spacecraft to successfully take astronauts to the moon.


2. **Literal.** What were some of the things that Aldrin and Armstrong did during

their time on the moon?


» They practiced walking, collected rock samples, took pictures, and performed

experiments.


3. **Literal.** What were some of the things they learned while they were there?


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**176**


» They learned that the soil on the moon was fine and slippery, they brought back rocks

that could be studied, and they learned about the effects of the gravity on the moon.


4. **Evaluative.** Identify and describe some of the different kinds of spacecraft

and tools that scientists use to explore and study space.


» A probe is an unmanned spacecraft that takes pictures and gathers information and

can travel far out into the solar system; a space shuttle is a winged, manned, reusable

spacecraft that carries astronauts and equipment; the Hubble Telescope revolves around

Earth and can gather information and images from far out in space; observatories are

located in dark, high places on Earth and use telescopes to study space.


~~**ANTICIPATORY GUIDE SUMMARY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Direct students to look at the bottom of Activity Page 9.1. Tell students to

5. Write the word _triumph_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed.
Review syllable division patterns at this time as well.


6. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “With this new triumph, or accomplishment,
scientists asked a new question.”


7. Say the word _triumph_ with me.


8. A triumph is a special achievement, success, accomplishment, or victory.


9. Writing his first chapter book was a triumph for Julian!


10. Have you ever experienced a triumph? Where were you? Be sure to use the
word _triumph_ when you tell about it. Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to make complete sentences:
“I experienced a triumph once when . . . ”


11. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _triumph_ ?


  - Use a Synonyms and Antonyms activity for follow-up. Ask students, “What
does _triumph_ mean? What are some words or phrases that are synonyms,
or words that have a similar meaning?” Prompt students to provide words or
phrases like _victory, first place, accomplishment, success, a win_, etc. Then ask,

                  - Students are likely to make the following errors:


                        - For ‘n’, students may write ‘nn’, ‘kn’, or ‘gn’.


                        - For ‘nn’, students may write ‘n’, ‘kn’, or ‘gn’.


                        - For ‘kn’, students may write ‘n’, ‘nn’, or ‘gn’.


                        - For ‘gn’, students may write ‘n’, ‘nn’, or ‘kn’.


                 - While the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be aware

that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to
record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.
For example:


                        - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning
consonants?


                  - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


                  - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization and
punctuation.

~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


  - At the end of the Read-Aloud, ask students what they noticed about your reading.


What exactly holds all of this stuff together in this huge universe?

Why don’t all these stars and planets just go flying off in any

direction all over the universe? Why do they stick together in groups

and clusters like solar systems and galaxies? These are excellent

questions, and the answer is . . . gravity!


**Gravity** is an invisible **force** of attraction between objects. It’s the

**force** that holds galaxies and solar systems together. It’s the force


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level texts.



Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**196**


that keeps us firmly planted on planet Earth instead of flying off into

space. It’s the **force** that keeps Earth revolving around the sun and

keeps the moon revolving around Earth. You can’t see **gravity** or

touch it, but **gravity** is present between everything in the universe

that has mass. Because of **gravity**, every single bit of **matter** in the

universe pulls on every other piece of **matter** in the universe.


  - Pause and allow students to finish annotating the paragraph.


You and I exert a pull on each other, but because we have very little

mass in our bodies compared to celestial bodies, our **gravitational**

**pull** on each other is very small—so small we can’t feel it at all.


**Gravity** depends greatly on mass . . . so what exactly is mass?

Mass is just the amount of **matter** in an object. You and I are small

compared to, say, a planet or a star. We’re made of less “stuff,” so our

mass is much, much smaller. Mass is important when you are trying

to understand gravity, because the larger the mass, the larger the

**gravitational pull** . So objects with really large masses, like stars and

planets, have a really big **gravitational pull** on other objects. And

objects with really small masses, like you or me, have really small

gravitational pulls on other objects—so small we don’t even notice

the pull at all. The more mass an object has, the more **gravity**, or pull,

it is capable of. Because Earth has so much mass compared to all

of the things that are on the surface of the earth, its surface **gravity**

keeps the things on Earth from flying off into space. You, your house,

your bed, a ball you throw up into the air—all of these things stay on

Earth due to **gravity** ! Even Earth’s atmosphere and the oxygen we

breathe are held close to Earth by its **gravitational pull** !


  - Pause to allow students to finish annotating this paragraph.


**Gravity** also causes you to have weight when you stand on a scale!

Earth’s **gravity** pulls down on you. The more mass you have, the


Lesson 11 Gravity, Part 1
**197**


harder the pull, and the higher the numbers on the scale. Think

about an astronaut who is standing on the moon. The astronaut

stays on the surface of the moon because of the moon’s **gravity** . If

the astronaut stood on a scale on the moon, the astronaut’s weight

would be six times less than the weight of the same astronaut on a

scale on Earth! So, a person who weighs 60 pounds on Earth would

weigh only 10 pounds on the moon—about the weight of a bag of

flour—because the moon has less mass than Earth, and its **force** of

**gravity** is not as strong.


But the astronaut does not get pulled off the moon and back through

space to Earth! Earth still has a larger mass than the moon, and it

still has a larger **gravitational pull** than the moon. But because the

astronaut is far away from Earth and very close to the moon, the

**gravitational pull** of the moon has the most effect. It keeps the

astronaut on the moon.


                 - Pause to allow students to finish annotating this paragraph.


That’s another important thing to know about **gravity** —the distance

between two objects affects the **gravitational pull** between them.

Objects that are close to each other pull harder than objects that are

farther away. The effect of an object’s **gravitational pull** lessens as

you get farther away from it. The sun has a lot more mass than Earth

does. But the sun is also a lot farther away, and because we are on

the surface of Earth, Earth’s **gravity** has a much bigger effect on us,

keeping us firmly on Earth—one of the many benefits of **gravity** !


The sun contains 99 percent of all the mass in our solar system.

Because the sun has more mass by far than anything else in the

solar system, it also has more **gravity** than anything else in the solar

system. The sun’s **gravity** —or **force** of attraction—is so strong that it

constantly pulls the planets toward it.


                 - Pause to allow students to finish annotating these paragraphs.


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**198**


You may be wondering why the planets don’t crash into the sun if the

sun is pulling on them. Don’t worry; that never happens because the

planets are also moving really fast in their own orbits around the sun.


The combination of the planets’ own speed and the sun’s

**gravitational pull** toward it is what keeps the planets constantly

circling in orbit around the sun. It’s a perfect balance—the planets

continue in their predictable movements around the sun.


Sometimes **gravity** is so powerful that a black hole is formed: an

object or area with an extremely strong **gravitational pull** . There

are many **black holes** in space, and a **black hole’s gravity** is so

strong that once something gets close enough, nothing can escape

its **gravitational pull** —not even light! Astronomers find **black holes**

in space by noticing the movement of objects around them. You can’t

see **gravity**, but you can observe the way the **force of gravity** affects

objects. Scientists are still learning about **black holes**, like many

other things in outer space.


  - Pause to allow students to finish annotating these paragraphs.


On a clear night, we can often see the moon moving across our night

sky. Have you ever been curious about why Earth has a moon? Many

scientists think that about four and a half billion years ago there

was a massive collision between Earth and a very large asteroid.

The information they have gathered shows that the moon may have

formed from the leftover debris from this amazing impact. Earth’s

**gravity** was able to hold the moon in its orbit. There is a strong

**gravitational pull** between Earth and the moon. The moon’s **gravity**

pulls on all of the things on the earth—including people! But Earth’s

**gravity** is strong enough to keep us on Earth.


  - Pause to allow students to finish annotating this paragraph.


Lesson 11 Gravity, Part 1
**199**


Challenge


Students can create
questions and answers on

index cards that can
be used during a unit

review game.



The moon’s **gravity** also pulls on Earth’s oceans, but Earth’s **gravity**

pulls back—and it’s a good thing it’s stronger! The moon’s gravity

is just strong enough that it can move the water on Earth enough to

cause **tides** in the oceans. **Tides** cause the regular rise and fall of

the ocean’s waters. People can see the effects of tides if they are at

the seashore.


High **tides** cause the waves to come high up on the beach, and when

low **tides** occur, the waves don’t come up as far. Low **tide** is a good

time to walk the beach and look for shells and creatures that live in

the sand.


So, yes, the powerful effects of **gravity** can explain a lot of interesting

things in the universe—it’s what holds our moon in orbit around

Earth. It’s what causes ocean **tides** on Earth day after day. **Gravity**

is why we stay on Earth and why objects we throw into the air come

back down. **Gravity** even helps create new stars and planets by

helping pull together the gases and dust that form them. We can’t

see **gravity**, but we can see its effects all around us—on Earth, in our

solar system, and throughout our galaxy!

3. What can we do to reduce the amount of friction on the paper?


» Answers may vary, but may include: crumple it, drop the paper vertically, fold the paper, etc.


 - Tell students to test out their ideas for Experiment #2. They should make a
prediction, record the result, and then explain why it happened.


 - After students have conducted Experiment #2, have them try the experiment one
more time, trying to reduce the air friction even more. Have them record the results.


 - Explain to students that the earth’s gravity exerts the same force on all
objects, no matter how much mass each object has. Explain also that it
is friction that causes some items to fall more slowly than others. Guide
students to understand that resistance due to friction can be reduced by
changing an object’s shape or how it is dropped.


 - Remind students that in the Light and Sound unit, we learned about space
being a vacuum, meaning there are no air particles in it. If we were to conduct
the same experiment in a vacuum, the two falling objects, despite their size or
weight, will not be affected by air friction and will therefore fall at the same rate.

  - Practice the words as follows during the remaining time. Call on a student

to read any word on the table. Then have the student use the word in a
meaningful sentence. After the student says the sentence, have them ask
the class: “Does the sentence make sense?” If the class says yes, then the
student puts a check mark in front of the word and calls on another student
to come to the front and take a turn. If the class says no, have the student try
again, or call on another student to come to the front and use the word in a
meaningful sentence. This continues until all of the words are used or time
has run out.


  - Tell students this table will remain on display until the assessment so that
students may refer to it during the week.


  - Tell students they will take home Activity Page 11.3 with this week’s spelling
words to share with a family member.


  - Have students read the decodable passage, “All about Gravity”, that you
prepared in advance to practice decoding words with /ae/, /k/, /s/, /j/, and /n/.

What exactly holds all of this stuff together in this huge universe?

Why don’t all these stars and planets just go flying off in any

direction all over the universe? Why do they stick together in groups

and clusters like solar systems and galaxies? These are excellent

questions, and the answer is . . . **gravity** !


1. **VOC.** **Literal.** Who can tell us the definition of gravity?


» the force or pull created by the mass of objects in the universe toward each other


**Gravity** is an invisible **force** of attraction between objects. It’s the

**force** that holds galaxies and solar systems together. It’s the **force**

that keeps us firmly planted on planet Earth instead of flying off into

space. It’s the **force** that keeps Earth revolving around the sun and

keeps the moon revolving around Earth. You can’t see **gravity** or

touch it, but **gravity** is present between everything in the universe

that has mass. Because of **gravity**, every single bit of **matter** in the

universe pulls on every other piece of **matter** in the universe.


1. **LIT.** **Inferential.** Why does the author use the phrase, “It’s the force that

keeps us firmly planted on planet Earth”?


» The author uses the word “planted” to show that we don’t move off the earth; we

are planted like a plant or tree with roots.


2. **LIT. Evaluative.** Why do you think the author uses the phrase “It’s the force”

so many times in this paragraph?


» The author wanted to make sure that it’s understood that gravity is a force.


You and I exert a pull on each other, but because we have very little

mass in our bodies compared to celestial bodies, our **gravitational**

**pull** on each other is very small—so small we can’t feel it at all.


**Gravity** depends greatly on mass . . . so what exactly is mass?

Mass is just the amount of **matter** in an object. You and I are small

compared to, say, a planet or a star. We’re made of less “stuff,” so our

mass is much, much smaller. Mass is important when you are trying

to understand **gravity,** because the larger the mass, the larger the

**gravitational pull** . So objects with really large masses, like stars and

planets, have a really big **gravitational pull** on other objects. And

objects with really small masses, like you or me, have really small

gravitational pulls on other objects—so small we don’t even notice

the pull at all. The more mass an object has, the more **gravity**, or pull,

it is capable of. Because Earth has so much mass compared to all

of the things that are on the surface of the earth, its surface **gravity**

keeps the things on Earth from flying off into space. You, your house,

your bed, a ball you throw up into the air—all of these things stay on

Earth due to **gravity** ! Even Earth’s atmosphere and the oxygen we

breathe are held close to Earth by its **gravitational pull** !


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**210**


1. **VOC.** **Literal.** What is mass?


» the amount of matter in an object


2. **COMP.** **Inferential.** What is the connection between gravity and gravitational pull?


» Gravity is a force created by the mass of the objects in the universe, while

the gravitational pull is the amount of attraction between objects, based on

their mass.


3. **COMP.** **Inferential.** Why is mass important to understanding gravity?


» The amount of mass affects the amount of gravitational pull something has.


4. **COMP.** **Literal.** Do people have a gravitational pull toward each other?


» Yes, but it’s so small we can’t feel it.


5. **COMP.** **Literal.** Why doesn’t the atmosphere fly off into space?


» Earth’s gravitational pull keeps it close to Earth.


**Gravity** also causes you to have weight when you stand on a scale!

Earth’s **gravity** pulls down on you. The more mass you have, the

harder the pull, and the higher the numbers on the scale. Think

about an astronaut who is standing on the moon. The astronaut

stays on the surface of the moon because of the moon’s **gravity** . If

the astronaut stood on a scale on the moon, the astronaut’s weight

would be six times less than the weight of the same astronaut on a

scale on Earth! So, a person who weighs 60 pounds on Earth would

weigh only 10 pounds on the moon—about the weight of a bag of

flour—because the moon has less mass than Earth, and its **force** of

**gravity** is not as strong.


But the astronaut does not get pulled off the moon and back through

space to Earth! Earth still has a larger mass than the moon, and it

still has a larger **gravitational pull** than the moon. But because the

astronaut is far away from Earth and very close to the moon, the

**gravitational pull** of the moon has the most effect. It keeps the

astronaut on the moon.


1. **COMP.** **Inferential.** Describe the relationship between gravity and your

weight on a scale.


» Gravity pulls down on you while you are standing on a scale. The more mass you

have, the harder the pull, and the weight will show higher numbers.


Lesson 12 Gravity, Part 2
**211**


2. **SYN. Literal.** Look at the sentences at the end of the first paragraph

starting with “So, a person who weighs 60 pounds on Earth…” What other
punctuation marks do you see in that sentence?


» comma, dash


3. **SYN.** **Evaluative.** Why did the author use dashes in this sentence?


» The words between give information that helps us to understand what 10 pounds

feels like.


4. **COMP.** **Inferential.** What is the cause of astronauts staying in place on the

moon and not flying back toward Earth?


» the gravitational pull of the moon


That’s another important thing to know about **gravity** —the distance

between two objects affects the **gravitational pull** between them.

Objects that are close to each other pull harder than objects that are

farther away. The effect of an object’s **gravitational pull** lessens as

you get farther away from it. The sun has a lot more mass than Earth

does. But the sun is also a lot farther away, and because we are on

the surface of Earth, Earth’s **gravity** has a much bigger effect on us,

keeping us firmly on Earth—one of the many benefits of **gravity** !


1. **VOC.** **Inferential.** What is the meaning of the word _benefits_, in the last

sentence?


» something that is an advantage; a good thing


The sun contains 99 percent of all the mass in our solar system.

Because the sun has more mass by far than anything else in the

solar system, it also has more **gravity** than anything else in the solar

system. The sun’s **gravity** —or **force** of attraction—is so strong that it

constantly pulls the planets toward it.


You may be wondering why the planets don’t crash into the sun if the

sun is pulling on them. Don’t worry; that never happens because the

planets are also moving really fast in their own orbits around the sun.


The combination of the planets’ own speed and the sun’s

**gravitational pull** toward it is what keeps the planets constantly


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**212**


circling in orbit around the sun. It’s a perfect balance—the planets

continue in their predictable movements around the sun.


1. **COMP.** **Inferential.** What are the two factors that keep the planets in their

orbits around the sun?


» the planets’ speed as they circle the sun and the sun’s gravitational pull


2. **LIT.** **Evaluative.** Find words or phrases that the author uses to keep our

attention.


» Answers vary but should include: “You may be wondering...,” “Don’t worry…,” and

“perfect balance.”


Sometimes **gravity** is so powerful that a **black hole** is formed: an

object or area with an extremely strong **gravitational pull** . There

are many **black holes** in space, and a **black hole’s** **gravity** is so

strong that once something gets close enough, nothing can escape

its **gravitational pull** —not even light! Astronomers find **black holes**

in space by noticing the movement of objects around them. You can’t

see **gravity**, but you can observe the way the **force** **of** **gravity** affects

objects. Scientists are still learning about **black holes**, like many

others things in outer space.


~~Did you know that there are many, many black holes in our own Milky~~

~~Way Galaxy?~~


1. **COMP.** **Evaluative.** Why do you think these powerful areas of gravitational

pull were named black holes?


» Objects fall into them and not even light can escape.


2. **COMP.** **Inferential.** If you can’t see black holes, how do scientists know they

are there?


» Scientists study the movement of the objects around them, watching for the

effects of gravity.


On a clear night, we can often see the moon moving across our

night sky. Have you ever been curious about why Earth has a


Lesson 12 Gravity, Part 2
**213**


moon? Many scientists think that about four and a half billion years

ago there was a massive collision between Earth and a very large

asteroid. The information they have gathered shows that the moon

may have formed from the leftover debris from this amazing impact.

Earth’s **gravity** was able to hold the moon in its orbit. There is a

strong **gravitational pull** between Earth and the moon. The moon’s

**gravity** pulls on all of the things on the earth—including people! But

Earth’s **gravity** is strong enough to keep us on Earth.


1. **VOC.** **Inferential.** What does the word _collision_ mean?


» smashing together; a violent hit between two objects


2. **COMP** **Evaluative.** Why does the author say scientists “think” there was a
massive collision or “the moon may have formed” when talking about the
origins of the moon?


» It happened so long ago that there are no witnesses, so they are using information

they gathered to form a theory about what happened.


The moon’s **gravity** also pulls on Earth’s oceans, but Earth’s **gravity**

pulls back—and it’s a good thing it’s stronger! The moon’s **gravity**

is just strong enough that it can move the water on Earth enough to

cause **tides** in the oceans. **Tides** cause the regular rise and fall of

the ocean’s waters. People can see the effects of **tides** if they are at

the seashore.


High **tides** cause the waves to come high up on the beach, and when

low **tides** occur, the waves don’t come up as far. Low **tide** is a good

time to walk the beach and look for shells and creatures that live in

the sand.


So, yes, the powerful effects of **gravity** can explain a lot of interesting

things in the universe—it’s what holds our moon in orbit around

Earth. It’s what causes ocean **tides** on Earth day after day. **Gravity**

is why we stay on Earth and why objects we throw into the air come

back down. **Gravity** even helps create new stars and planets by


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**214**


helping pull together the gases and dust that form them. We can’t

see **gravity**, but we can see its effects all around us—on Earth, in our

solar system, and throughout our galaxy!


1. **COMP.** **Inferential.** Describe the effects of gravity on Earth’s oceans.


» The moon’s gravity pulls on the oceans, but Earth’s gravity pulls it back,

creating tides.


2. **VOC.** **Inferential.** What does the beach look like at high tide?


» The waves come up on the beach higher.


3. **VOC.** **Inferential.** What does the beach look like at low tide?


» The waves don’t come up as far; you might find shells and sea creatures.


4. **COMP.** **Evaluative.** In the last paragraph, which sentence sums up this entire

text the best?


» “We can’t see gravity, but we can see its effects all around us….”


~~**CORNERS ACTIVITY (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Divide students into three groups.


  - Tell students to make sure they have Activity Page 11.1.


  - Tell students that each group will be assigned to a corner of the classroom to

Pausing Point 2


Note to Teacher


At this point in the Astronomy unit, students have been learning more
about the universe, some of its characteristics, and important people in our
understanding of space. It is recommended that you pause here and spend a
day reviewing, reinforcing, or extending the material taught so far.


We suggest you begin with the whole-class Read-Aloud activity to reinforce
unit content and strengthen students’ skills in reading across genres. Then
you may wish to use the remaining time to provide remediation opportunities
that target specific areas of weakness for individual students, small groups,
or the whole class.


~~**CORE CONTENT UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


  - Describe stars as hot, distant, and made of gas.


  - Describe the characteristics of stars.


  - Compare and contrast our sun and other stars.


  - Describe a galaxy as a very large cluster of stars.


  - Identify the Milky Way as our own galaxy and Andromeda as the closest
spiral galaxy in our universe.


  - Describe the universe as a vast space that extends beyond the imagination.


  - Describe gravity and the effects it has on Earth, within the solar system,
and in the universe.


  - Recognize and name important constellations and how they are useful.


  - Describe the life and contributions of Nicolaus Copernicus.


~~**READ-ALOUD**~~


  - Locate the trade book _Moonshot: The Flight of Apollo 11_ by Brian Floca in your
school or local library.

  - Ask students to review what was important about the Apollo 11 mission.
_(The Apollo 11 mission was the first time people landed on the moon)._ If
students need additional review, you may reread selections from Lesson 9,
“Space Exploration,” before reading the trade book.


Pausing Point 2 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond

                  - Ask students to think about how it would feel to travel in space. _(Answers_
_may vary, but students might say it would be exciting, lonely, scary, etc.)_

                  - Explain that today you will read a book about the Apollo 11 mission. This book

gave Michael Collins, an astronaut who flew in the Apollo 11 mission, the
feeling that he “was back up in space.” As you read aloud, students should
listen carefully to think about how the author describes the experience of
traveling in space.

                 - Read the trade book _Moonshot: The Flight of Apollo 11_ by Brian Floca.


After the reading, use the following questions to facilitate discussion.


1. Who were the astronauts on Apollo 11?


» Michael Collins, Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin


2. Where did Apollo 11 launch?


» Florida


3. Name some of the text features in this book and explain how they contribute
to the text’s overall meaning.


» The book’s text features include detailed diagrams of the spacecraft and launch

vehicle. Labels and descriptions on the diagrams help explain what each part of

the spacecraft and launch vehicle does. The book also includes illustrations. They

can add more information by helping readers understand what something looked

like in space or from space. The book also uses formatting, such as bold print, to

draw attention to certain parts of the text.


4. What is the author’s purpose in this text? Name some examples from the
text that help show the author’s purpose.


» The author’s purpose is to help readers understand what happened on the Apollo 11

mission and what it was like for the astronauts. Textual examples may vary but could

include that the diagrams give information to illustrate how the astronauts traveled or

that the author explains what it was like to sleep, eat, or use the toilet in space.


5. Compare what people on Earth experience to what the astronauts
experience. Make sure to include evidence from the text in your answer.


» Answers may vary, but students should draw on the text for their response. For

example, they may note that on the Moon, it is dark all day, while on Earth there is

daylight.

**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: chart paper or board


  - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word, such as _black hole_ .
Have them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the
word. Record their responses on chart paper or a whiteboard for reference.

**Graffiti Wall**


Materials: chart paper, markers


  - Give groups of students a key unit concept or vocabulary words, such as
_black holes_ or _observatory_ . Have them brainstorm everything that comes to
mind when they hear the word they were assigned. Students will record their
response in both words and pictures on the chart paper. Have students do a
gallery walk of other groups’ charts.


**Read, Remember, Retell**


Materials: Readers


  - Divide students into partners. Make sure they have their Readers. Direct
them to choose any chapter between Chapters 1–8.


  - In partners, have the students silently read a paragraph in the text. Next,

the students will turn to their partners, cover up what they read, and try to
remember and retell what they read. Their partner will listen and fill in any
missing information. For the next paragraph, the partners can switch roles
remembering and retelling. Continue going back and forth until the end of
the chapter.


**Poster Session**


Materials: chart paper, markers


  - Divide students into small groups. Let each group decide on a key idea or
concept from their reading that can be visualized on a poster. Students
can use words or pictures to describe the concept. When the posters are
complete, hang them up around the room and allow students to walk around
to view and discuss the posters.


**Compare and Contrast**


Materials: paper, pencil


  - Have students compare and contrast any of the following, creating their own
graphic organizer:

    - our solar system and the Milky Way Galaxy


    - the Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy


Pausing Point 2 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**221**


**Constellation Stories**


Materials: paper, pencil


                 - Have students draw their own constellation and write a story about how
it got its name. Give examples from the reading, such as Ursa Major being
called the Big Bear because connecting the dots creates an image of a bear,
or the Big Dipper creates the image of a large ladle.


**Planet for Sale!**


Materials: paper, pencil or markers


                  - Have students design an advertisement to sell one of the planets in our solar
system or a made-up planet in another galaxy. Students must name the
planet, describe its characteristics, and describe its “neighborhood” (other
planets close by or which galaxy it’s in). Students should use descriptive and
persuasive words designed to interest a buyer.


**RAFT** **Writing**


Materials: paper, pencil, whiteboard or chart paper


Students will complete a RAFT writing activity as described below.


Writing Prompt: Describe to someone in another galaxy what your galaxy,
solar system, and planet are like.


                 - Go through the RAFT with students so they understand the task. Write the
letters _RAFT_ on the board. Explain to students:


R— **Role** of the writer. Who are you?


A—Who is the **audience** ?


F—In what **format** are you writing?


T—What **topic** are you writing about?


                   - Tell students to write the letters _RAFT_ going down from the top of their paper
and fill in each of the categories next to the letters.


                  - Alternately, provide some of the categories for the students. For example,
for the letter ‘F’, write _letter_ so the students know the format they will be
writing in.


**Text Feature Comparison**


**Materials:** trade books, textbooks, articles, images, photos, diagrams, etc.,
with text features on similar topics in astronomy


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**222**


  - Have students choose two materials to compare and contrast. For example,
a student could choose an image of the Milky Way Galaxy and an article or
text about shapes of galaxies. Students can use a T-chart or Venn diagram to
compare and contrast the two materials.


**Writing Prompts**


Materials: pencil, paper


  - Have students write to one of the following writing prompts:


    - The most interesting thing I’ve learned so far is .


    - The importance of gravity here on Earth (or in the solar system; in the
galaxy) is .


    - Imagine that you could safely visit any planet in the solar system.

Which one would you visit and why? Be sure to use the characteristics
of the planet when describing why you would want to visit it.

**Independent Reading**


Materials: assortment of books about astronomy


  - Have students read additional trade books about astronomy in your
classroom or from the library. After reading, have the students write a book
review that includes the following:


    - The title and author.


    - Why did you choose the book?


    - A brief summary.


    - Your favorite part.


    - What do you really want a reader to know about this book?


    - Would you recommend the book to others? Why?


**Research Activity: The North Star**

  - Some students may wish to research the North Star and learn more about

how it has changed over long periods of time. Allow students time to share
their findings with a group or with the class.

**Research Activity: Orienteering**

  - Some students may wish to research the recreational competition called

orienteering and learn more about its history and how one participates in a
modern orienteering event. Allow students the time to share their findings
with a group or with the class.

  - Distribute highlighters or pens for students to circle key ideas and
details (optional).


  - Tell students that today they’ll be reading about an astronomer who lived in
the late 1400s and 1500s named Nicolaus Copernicus.


  - Tell students that there are several purposes for today’s reading. First, they
will learn about Copernicus and get the key idea of the text, but they will also
be getting to know the text better because they will be using it to turn into a
type of play called Reader’s Theater.


  - Have students take a moment to set their own purpose for reading, such as
“learn more about Copernicus” or “find ideas to use in a play.” ~~**TEKS 3.6.A**~~


  - Tell students that in today’s Read-Aloud, they will again hear vocabulary words
that are related to the process or work of science and also sometimes to
our everyday lives. Ask students if they have ever heard the word _hypothesis_
and what they think it means. Explain that people often come up with a
hypothesis to explain why something happens as it does. For example, tell
students that they might make a hypothesis to explain why a pet behaves a
certain way.


  - Tell students that after a person makes a hypothesis about why something
happens, the next step is to gather evidence by observing closely and

finding a way to test the idea. The evidence they find might cause them to
change the hypothesis or to be more certain of it. Tell students that if a lot of
evidence is found in support of a hypothesis and lots of people accept that it
is true, then it becomes a theory.


  - Tell students that Nicolaus Copernicus studied space and that his views and
new ideas about space shocked many people, changing what people knew
about astronomy forever.


~~**READ-ALOUD: “NICOLAUS COPERNICUS” (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Make sure students follow along on Activity Page 13.1 as you read aloud.


  - Remind students to circle key ideas as they read along. (Optional)


  - As you read, model appropriate rate and prosody for students. While reading,
make sure to pay careful attention to the types of sentences (exclamatory,
declarative, interrogative) and reflect that in your tone. Make sure to model full
stops at periods and pauses at commas. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


  - At the end of the Read-Aloud, ask students what they noticed about your reading.


How would you like to present the world with a new idea about how

something works? What if, besides being new, your idea was so different

from the ideas that people had believed for so long that people were

opposed to even listening to your ideas? That kind of fierce **opposition**

is exactly what a man named Nicolaus Copernicus experienced

hundreds of years ago when he had a new idea about astronomy.


~~Ask students the meaning of~~ ~~_fierce_~~ ~~. (~~ ~~_very intense or powerful_~~ ~~)~~


Nicolaus Copernicus was a regular person, just like you. He was born

in Torun, Poland, in 1473 and was raised by his uncle because both of

his parents died when he was about 10 years old. Copernicus went to

universities in Poland and Italy and became a clergyman and doctor.


Copernicus studied many subjects, including math, philosophy,

church law, and medicine. But his favorite subject of all—and the

thing that he had a big new idea about—was astronomy.


As you have learned, astronomy is the study of the stars, space, and

the universe, and astronomers are scientists who study these amazing

Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**228**


phenomena. Long before Copernicus was born, the Greek philosopher

Aristotle observed that the sun appeared to “rise” in the east and “set”

in the west. Because Aristotle observed this **diurnal** motion of the sun

with his own eyes, he—and many others—thought that the earth was

stationary and that the sun and all of the planets revolved around it.

These observations and the strong belief in this way of looking at the

universe shaped people’s views for a very long time.


~~Have students check their glossary to find out what the word~~

~~_diurnal_~~ ~~means.~~


~~Say,~~ ~~“We’ve heard the word~~ ~~_phenomena_~~ ~~before. Who remembers~~

~~what it means?” (~~ ~~_It’s the plural form of phenomenon, meaning “an_~~

~~_impressive or extraordinary occurrence or event._~~ ~~”)~~


For more than 1,000 years before Copernicus was born, most

astronomers and other people thought that the universe was

**geocentric** . In other words, scientists thought that Earth was the

center of the solar system and the universe. They thought Earth

stood still and the sun and all of the planets and the moon circled

around it, while the stars remained fixed in a rotating sphere that was

farther away.


~~Ask,~~ ~~“Which sentence gives us the definition of geocentric?”(~~ ~~_In_~~

~~_other words, scientists thought that Earth was the center of the solar_~~

~~_system and the universe_~~ ~~.)~~


~~Call on a few volunteers to describe what this might look like. (It~~

~~would look something like an onion with the earth at the center, the~~

~~outer layer being all the stars, and the inner layers showing the orbits~~

~~of the sun and the planets around the sun.)~~


You have heard that most people believed the **geocentric** theory of

the universe for more than 1,000 years. Why? Because it was the best

explanation anyone had come up with for why the sun and planets

appeared to move the way they did. All of our observations were from

Earth. Remember, people did not have all of the scientific tools back

then that we have today, such as artificial satellites, spaceships, and

high-powered telescopes. These tools have greatly expanded modern

understandings of space through new opportunities for observation

and gathering data. Think about the difference between a person

standing on Earth looking around, and a person in an airplane looking

down on the Earth-bound person. The person in the airplane can see

a much wider scope of Earth. Powerful telescopes have given us this

new kind of perspective when we look up into space.


Most Greeks, including the famous philosopher Aristotle, believed the

**geocentric** theory. There were a few exceptions, such as the Greek

astronomer Aristarchus who, after much study, concluded that the

sun was much larger than Earth, and that it was Earth that moved

around the sun. His new idea, called a **hypothesis**, was never accepted

by ancient astronomers, but after many, many years, Aristarchus’s

ideas greatly influenced other astronomers in their studies.


~~Ask,~~ ~~“Why is a hypothesis not just a wild guess?” (~~ ~~_A scientist has an_~~

~~_idea and gathers evidence from study and observation_~~ ~~.)~~


Most ancient Romans believed the **geocentric** theory. During this

time, it was the official position of the powerful Roman Catholic

Church. Most astronomers were afraid to question it or explore other

**hypotheses**, though there were others before Copernicus who were

trying to work out alternative explanations. When Copernicus was

born in 1473, almost everyone in Europe believed in this **geocentric**

theory, too. And almost everyone had no idea that this view of the

universe was about to change!


How could so many people have a completely different view of the

universe than we do today? The answer is easy. What we know

about the way the universe works—all of science—comes from

the observations and **logical** thinking of regular people, just like

you and me. Astronomers have always used scientific theories to

explain the movement of the stars and planets. Scientific theories

aren’t necessarily complicated or hard to understand—they are just

possible explanations of how or why things happen. But remember,

scientific theories aren’t just guesses. They are ideas that are

based upon evidence and careful observation of the world—such as

observing where the stars appear in the sky every night.


Sometimes, however, what we think we are seeing is not what



Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**230**


actually is, such as the world looking flat but actually being round.


A long time ago, stargazers spent a lot of time outside looking at the

night sky and noticed patterns in the sky. Early astronomers knew

that the planets had different movements than the stars, which

circled around Polaris once a day. Astronomers observed that the

planets moved slowly across the night sky along a certain pathway.

But people had also started noticing some odd things about the

motion of the planets as they followed this pathway. One of these odd

things was that sometimes Mars and other planets made a strange

backward loop in the sky. Scientists had tried to explain this motion

using the **geocentric** theory of the universe, but the explanations

became pretty complicated. Still, most people didn’t question that

Earth was the center of the universe.


~~Ask,~~ ~~“What do you remember about Polaris?”(~~ ~~_It is mostly fixed in the_~~

~~_night sky, and all the rest of the stars appear to travel around it. It’s_~~

~~_also known as the North Star_~~ ~~.)~~


But Copernicus asked himself the question: If the planets were

revolving around Earth, why would they follow such complicated

patterns? He didn’t think they would, and so he used his **logical** mind

to come up with a different scientific **hypothesis** that would better

explain this strange looping motion. Copernicus also had the work of

Aristarchus long before to add to his own studies. In science, often

the work of one scientist is built upon the work of the many scientists

who have come before them.


What was the scientific **hypothesis** that Copernicus decided upon? It

was a **heliocentric hypothesis** of the universe. Does this idea sound

familiar? This was the **hypothesis** of Aristarchus more than 1,000

years earlier! By using mathematics to make careful **calculations** of

the positions of the sun, planets, and other celestial bodies, Nicolaus

Copernicus came to the same conclusion: that the sun was at the

center of everything. He thought that Earth revolved around the sun

along with the rest of the planets. Copernicus also **hypothesized**

that the earth is spinning and rotates on its own axis.

~~What did Copernicus do to come to his heliocentric hypothesis of~~

~~used mathematics to calculate the positions of the sun, planets,~~

~~and other celestial bodies. He used all this information to come to a~~

~~Call on a few volunteers to describe what this might look like.~~


Of course, we now know that the earth does rotate on its own axis.

And we also know that although the sun isn’t the center of the

universe, it is the center of our solar system. So, the **heliocentric**

scientific **hypothesis** that Copernicus presented in the 1500s (that

was built upon the scientific **hypothesis** Aristarchus had presented

more than 1,000 years earlier) was much closer to the truth than the

**geocentric** theory that had been held for so many years.


Unfortunately, similar to Aristarchus, Copernicus’s **hypothesis** was

not widely accepted by people during his lifetime. For one thing,

people thought that if the earth was spinning, all the things on it

would be thrown off the earth and into space. They didn’t understand

that the force of gravity holds us firmly on Earth! Another part of the

reason for this is that Copernicus’s ideas were not published until

literally the day he died.


~~Some people think that Copernicus may have waited until the very~~

~~last moment in his life because his hypothesis was so unpopular.~~


But another part of the reason that the **heliocentric hypothesis**

was not widely accepted was that Copernicus’s ideas challenged the

belief held by most people that humans were at the center of the

universe. This was very difficult for many people to accept, so change

came slowly. Still, as with the studies of Aristarchus, the studies of

Copernicus greatly influenced the astronomers who came after him,

including the great Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei.


~~Say,~~ ~~“In Chapter 8 of~~ ~~_What’s in Our Universe?,_~~ ~~we learned about the~~

~~earliest exploration of space. Who remembers one of the things~~

~~Galileo is known for?” (~~ ~~_Answers vary, but should be that he built a_~~

~~_more powerful telescope and discovered four of Jupiter’s moons_~~ ~~.)~~



Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**232**


Galileo was inspired by the work of Copernicus and became one of

the first astronomers to build and use a telescope to study space in

more detail. As you heard earlier, Galileo discovered four of Jupiter’s

moons. He observed that the moons orbit, or revolve, around Jupiter

instead of Earth. His discoveries provided further evidence that

Aristarchus and Copernicus were—although in the great minority—

correct in their **heliocentric** theories!


Nicolaus Copernicus had made careful observations of the stars and

other celestial bodies. He recorded these observations with great

attention. But it was his willingness to ask questions—even when

unpopular—that led him to a clearer answer. Each time you ask

questions to help understand something better, you are following in

the footsteps of the great astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.


~~Ask,~~ ~~“Why were Copernicus’s ideas unpopular?”(~~ ~~_They went against_~~

~~_what was believed at the time and the official position of the Roman_~~

~~_Catholic Church_~~ ~~.)~~


Asking questions to get closer to the truth is what the scientific

process is all about. Copernicus’s questioning mind and careful

observations led him to a new **hypothesis** about the arrangement of

what we now know as the solar system. Though people were slow to

accept his **hypothesis**, the astronomers who followed Copernicus

gathered more and more evidence, so that today the **heliocentric**

view is the accepted theory. It’s important to remember that new

information and evidence often change our views about the world!

1. **Evaluative.** What are some words you might use to describe Copernicus?


» Answers vary, but could include _thoughtful, curious, intelligent, brave, logical,_

_observant,_ etc.


2. **Evaluative.** What tools and methods did Copernicus use for studying space?


» He made many observations, kept records, did mathematical calculations, and

studied other astronomer’s views. He did not use a telescope; they hadn’t been

invented yet.


Lesson 13 Reader’s Theater: Nicolaus Copernicus
**233**


3. **Evaluative.** Astronomers in Copernicus’s time were puzzled about the

movement of Mars and some of the other planets. What question did they

have about the planets’ movements, and how did this lead Copernicus to a new

understanding?


» Astronomers wondered why Mars and some of the planets seem to travel

backward at times in their paths across the night sky. This led Copernicus to think

of other arrangements of the planets and the sun that would explain this odd and

unexpected movement.


4. **Inferential.** Why did people have a difficult time believing that Earth was

spinning in space?


» They thought that if the Earth spun in space they would be thrown off, along with

all the other objects on Earth.


5. **Inferential.** What was new about Copernicus’s view of the world?


» He supported a heliocentric view with the sun in the center and Earth and the

other planets revolving around the sun.


» gravity


6. **Inferential.** Name another astronomer who later worked to prove

Copernicus’s heliocentric view.

  - Tell students they will be taking the text they just read, “Nicolaus
Copernicus,” and turning it into a play.


  - Explain that this play is different, in that the actors do not have to memorize
their lines. They are allowed to read their lines, which is why it is called a
“Reader’s Theater.”


  - Also explain that, in Reader’s Theater, there is no need for costumes or props.


  - Brainstorm with the students the different types of jobs and roles that are
required in a play.


  - Write these on the board or chart paper and discuss what each person does.


Director: helps stage the action and helps actors with their lines


Actors: characters in the play that say the lines


Narrator(s): people who read parts of the action aloud to move the
story along


Producer: person who makes sure that everyone involved with the play
has everything they need. The producer will also write down all the lines in
order on a single copy of the script. If possible, collect the copy from each
of the producers when the scripts are completed and make copies of each
for the members of the groups.


Chorus: a role from ancient Greek times, where a group of actors say the
lines together, usually to make a point or move action along


  - Tell the students which groups they will be in, from 1 to 6. If you assigned the

roles of director and producer in advance, tell the groups who they are.


  - Tell students to make sure that they have Activity Page 13.1. Each part of the
text is numbered 1–6. They will be responsible for the text that matches their
group number.


  - Have them turn to Activity Page 13.2 and go through the page, so they
understand what they need to do.


  - Tell students that they should write down all of their lines for Reader’s

Theater on writing paper before they transfer their lines to Activity Page 13.2.


~~**WRITING THE SCRIPT (45 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.1.D; TEKS 3.1.E; TEKS 3.12.A**~~

- Make sure each group has writing paper and each student has their two
activity pages.


- Tell the groups they will collaborate to write a script for the section of the text
that was assigned to their group.


- Explain that they will have to figure out how to bring the text to life with
characters and dialogue.


- Explain that all members of the group will be expected to perform, so they
may need to have more than one narrator, create characters that are already
in the text, and/or have a chorus where several actors read lines together.


- Remind them that both the director and the producer are supposed to
provide guidance and help, but that everyone’s opinions and ideas are
important and that everyone is considered a writer.


- Remind students to be respectful, take turns gaining the floor, stay on topic,
and contribute to the task and conversation.


- Tell students that their scripts should take about 3–4 minutes to perform.
They will need to use their imaginations to provide dialogue and action.
The producer will keep track of the time.


- Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


- Allow students time to write their scripts out. Circulate often to answer
questions and provide assistance as needed.

~~**SPELLING ASSESSMENT (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 15.1 for the spelling assessment.


  - Tell students that for this assessment, they will write their words under the
header to which they belong. For example, if you call out the word _today_, they
would write that word under the header ‘ay’> /ae/.


  - Tell students that should a spelling word fit under more than one header, they
should only write the word under one.


  - Tell students that they may not have to use all the lines under each header.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


  - Using the chart below, call out the words using the following format: Say the
word, use it in a sentence, and say the word once more.


  - After you have called out all of the words, including the Challenge Words and the
Content Word, go back through the list slowly, reading each word just once more.

                 - Ask students how they know if the sentences in a paragraph are in the right
order. (Answers vary, but should include that the content makes sense, or
the chronology is right, or that there is a cause and an effect, or that there
are clue words, etc.)


                 - Remind students of the informational text types they learned about in a
previous unit. Go over the chart below, (DP.U6.L15.1), emphasizing the clue
words for each of the types:

- Have the students get into the small groups you previously assigned.


- Give each small group either a #1 or a #2 envelope with the mixed-up
sentence strips that you previously prepared.


- Tell the groups that they will be working together to put the sentences about

the space shuttle in order so that they make the most sense. Tell them that
the sentences may not have any of the clue words, so they will have to use
their logic to figure out the order of the sentences.


- Explain to students that they are going to practice reading their sentences
with proper enunciation. Enunciation is the act of saying words clearly
and concisely, so that the correct sounds are heard and the words can be
understood by an audience.


- Provide time for students to practice enunciating their sentence with a
partner before reading as a group.


- When all the groups have finished, have all the #1 groups read their
paragraphs, with appropriate volume, clear enunciation, and correct
pronunciation, and explain why they put the sentences in that particular order.

Lesson 15 The Space Shuttle
**253**


The **space shuttle** was flown back into space again
and again. It **shuttled** back and forth between Earth and
space. That is why it was called the **space shuttle** .


The image on the previous page shows the **launch** of
a **space shuttle** . The **space shuttle** itself is the white part
that looks like a jet plane. The other parts are **booster**
**rockets** . The **booster rockets** helped the **space shuttle**
get off the ground. They helped the **space shuttle**
overcome Earth’s **gravity** . Once the **space shuttle** was up
into space, it dropped the **booster rockets** because it no
longer needed them.

                 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer.


» When the space shuttle returned to Earth, the pilot was able to land the

spacecraft on a runway like an airplane. In that way, it was able to be used again.


**Pages 74–75**

                 - Ask, “What are booster rockets and why are they a necessary part of the
space shuttle?”


» They boost the space shuttle to get off the ground by helping to overcome Earth’s

gravity. Once up in space, the booster rockets are dropped because they are no

longer needed.

In the thirty years between 1981 and 2011, different
**space shuttles** carried **astronauts** up into space on
many missions. The **space shuttle** was also used to bring
research equipment and tools into space. The **astronauts**
did many experiments to find out more about space.
Scientists were **especially** interested in learning about
what effect the lack of **gravity** would have on humans
and other living things.


The **space shuttle** was also used to help build an
amazing space station. **Astronauts** could live at the space
station for months at a time. Often, the **space shuttle**
carried supplies back and forth from Earth to the space
station. It also provided a ride home to Earth when it
was time for the **astronauts** to return.


The last **space shuttle** mission took place in July
2011. **NASA** scientists and Americans were proud of
everything the **astronauts** had accomplished in thirty
years. With the end of the **space shuttle** missions, **NASA**
is planning other ways to explore space. Those plans
include **launching unmanned probes** and **satellites** .
**NASA** scientists hope to learn more about the moon’s

Astronaut Mae Jemison


Mae Jemison’s answer to that

question was definitely yes! She

dreamed about going into space from





the time she was a little girl. And



when she grew up, that’s exactly what she did. In 1992, Mae Jemison

blasted into space aboard the space shuttle _Endeavour_ .


She lived on the _Endeavour_ for 8 days and conducted, or carried out,

many experiments while she was there. In these experiments, she

carefully collected information about how weightlessness in space affects

animals and humans. One of the experiments involved frog eggs. Jemison

wanted to see if they would develop into tadpoles normally while in orbit.


~~Tell students to read and answer question #2 on Activity Page 16.1.~~


Mae Jemison was the first African-American woman ever to go into

space. In fact, she was the first African-American female astronaut in

the history of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Lesson 16 Mae Jemison
**269**


1956 in Decatur, Alabama, but grew up in Chicago, Illinois. As a

child, Jemison was very interested in space. She was 12 years old

when astronaut Neil Armstrong and his Apollo 11 mission landed

on the moon. At age 14, Jemison was still interested in space, so

she read many adult books about astronomy. At the age of only 16,

she graduated from high school and went to college at Stanford

University in Stanford, California.


**Show Image U6.L16.4**
Mae Jemison Graduating from College


Education was very important to

Mae Jemison. Education is also

very important to NASA in choosing





who will become an astronaut.



While Jemison was at Stanford University, she studied chemical

engineering, which is the study of chemicals or substances and how

they can be used to solve problems or make products. While she

was at college, Jemison also enjoyed theater, dancing, and playing

football with her friends. She believed it was important to be a well
rounded person, which means to study and enjoy many different

things. Jemison graduated from college with a degree in chemical

engineering and African-American studies.

Besides wanting to be an astronaut,

Mae Jemison also wanted to be a

biomedical engineer.





Biomedical engineers seek new ways

to use technology to improve health care for people. When Jemison

graduated from college, she thought about applying right away to

NASA to become an astronaut but decided to go to medical school

first. In medical school, she traveled around the world, providing

medical care to people living in developing countries.


~~Tell students that a developing country is a country where most~~

As a medical school student, Jemison traveled to Kenya in Africa

where she helped with community medicine projects. Jemison also

traveled to Thailand in Asia to care for refugees from Cambodia.

developing countries. In the Peace Corps, Jemison was responsible

for the health of Peace Corps volunteers working in West Africa.

of space travel. She applied to NASA



to become an astronaut. But soon afterward, in January 1986, NASA

suffered a terrible tragedy in its Space Shuttle program. The space

shuttle _Challenger_ burst into flames a little over a minute after it was

launched. After this tragedy, all astronaut applications—including

Jemison’s—were postponed, meaning that NASA was not accepting

**271**


any applications for new astronauts for a time. After NASA reopened

the astronaut application program, Jemison found out she was

chosen to be an astronaut in 1987.


~~Tell students to read and answer question #5 on their activity page.~~


In 1992, after completing her Space Shuttle mission aboard the

_Endeavour_, Jemison was famous. She was the first African-American

woman to go into space. Jemison retired from NASA in 1993 to

pursue some of her other dreams. Jemison has used her fame as a

“launch pad” to bring important issues into the public spotlight. She

founded an international science camp called The Earth We Share.

Students at the international camp work to help solve current global

problems by using science and technology. She also started her own

company, which seeks to develop technologies that benefit planet

Earth and the people who live on it. But most of all, Jemison is a great

example of how important it is to follow your many dreams. Mae

Jemison is living proof that your dreams can literally take you “out of

this world!”


Check for Understanding


Have a discussion about how Mae Jemison used her fame as a “launch
pad” for bringing attention to important issues. If students have difficulty
expressing this, list some of the things she has accomplished since being
an astronaut. Ask students if they think that more people would be willing
to listen to what she has to say because they respect and look up to her
for being the first African-American woman in space.

Have students repeat the idiom. Ask students what a cap is.


» hat


                  - Explain that this idiom refers to an accomplishment that is worthy of praise.
Memorizing all of the multiplication tables, for example, can be a feather in
your cap. This 17th-century idiom comes from an ancient Native American
and Asian custom. Warriors placed a feather in their headgear for every
enemy they defeated in battle.


                 - Ask students, “In today’s Read-Aloud, which of Jemison’s accomplishments
could be seen as a feather in her cap?


» becoming a doctor and an engineer, serving in the Peace Corps, being the first

African-American female astronaut, etc.


                - When Mae Jemison became the first African-American female in space,
someone could have told her, “That accomplishment is a feather in your
cap!” It used to be that only men with backgrounds as jet pilots were
considered for becoming astronauts with NASA, so Jemison broke many
boundaries as an African-American woman who worked hard to develop
herself as a scientist.


                 - Ask students if they can think of a situation where they or someone else they

know has achieved an accomplishment that is a feather in their cap. You may
wish to share an example of your own. Try to find other opportunities to use
this saying in the classroom.

Lesson 16 Mae Jemison
**277**


Mae Jemison was born October 17, 1956, in
Decatur, Alabama. Her family moved to Chicago,
Illinois when she was young. Mae always took great pride
in her schoolwork. She was interested in science, but was
also interested in the arts. She finished high school early
at age 16! From there, she went to Stanford University
in California. Most college students focus on only one
topic of study because college is so challenging. Mae
focused and excelled in two topics of study—chemical
engineering and African-American studies!


After Stanford, Mae entered medical school to
become a doctor. She wanted to use her medical training
to help people in different countries on the continent
of Africa. To do this, she joined the **Peace Corps** as
a volunteer. As part of the Peace Corps, Mae treated
patients and also helped train other **health care** workers.
She worked hard to help improve health care in the
countries where she worked.

- Have students read **pages 80** - **81** to themselves to find the answer to these
questions: “Who is Dr. Mae Jemison? Why do you think she makes a good
role model?”


- When students have finished reading, restate the questions and ask students
to answer.


» Dr. Jemison worked hard in school, finished early, studied two subjects at once in

college, and joined the Peace Corps to use her medical training to help people in


Africa and countries where people are poor.


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond


After the **Peace Corps**, Mae came back to the United
States. She set her sights on a different goal. Her greatest
dream was to become an **astronaut** and travel into space.
She decided to apply to **NASA** to become an **astronaut** .
But the first time she applied, she was not accepted.
Instead of giving up, she tried again and **NASA** accepted
her the second time! She was one of only 15 people
chosen from a group of 2,000 people who wanted to
become **astronauts** !


Her training to become an **astronaut** was hard.
She had to get into great shape and train to get used to
being free of the effects of **gravity** in space. She also had
to study and pass many tests about space travel. Mae
Jemison succeeded in both.

» She became an astronaut and was chosen for a mission on the _Endeavour_

space shuttle.







Lesson 16 Mae Jemison
**279**


In 1992, Mae was chosen for a mission on the
_**Endeavour**_ **space shuttle** . A rocket **launched** the
_**Endeavour**_ into **orbit** around Earth. Mae became the
first African-American female **astronaut** in space!


The mission was to study the effects of weightlessness
on plants and animals. Mae conducted experiments
during the mission with fellow **astronaut** Jan Davis.
They collected information that the scientists at **NASA**
could study. The mission was a great success.


After her successful mission, Mae retired from
**NASA** . She became a professor at Dartmouth College,
sharing her love of science and space with other students.
She also started her own company called The Jemison
Group, Inc. Mae’s company searches for ways that
science can help improve the lives of people in countries
around the world. Mae Jemison is truly a role model that
we can all admire!

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Language**

                 - Add the following to the poster you created on chart paper for yesterday’s
Grammar lesson:


**Possessive Nouns**


A **singular possessive noun** shows that one person, place, or thing has
or owns something. Form a **singular possessive noun** by adding an
apostrophe and ‘s’ to a singular noun. (– _’s_ )


                  - Write the following sentences on the board or chart paper in cursive for use
during the Grammar lesson:


                        - (The offices of the doctors) are crowded today.


                        - (The tractors of the farmers) are painted green.


                        - (The ballet shoes of the dancers) are made of pink silk.


                        - (The mitts of the catchers) are made of brown leather.


                        - (The letters from the boys) made me laugh.

**Writing**

                  - Students will begin drafting an informative writing piece about the
International Space Station. If you plan to let students use computers to
write the piece, you may need to plan for extra time in the computer lab or
allow them to publish at home.

Check for Understanding


Ask students to list things that we do on Earth that are more challenging
on the space station. Have them give examples from the text. (Answers
vary: showering is tricky because the water needs to be scraped off;
astronauts have to run at least once a day to stay in shape; sleeping is
different because they don’t feel the effects of gravity, so they can be
upside down or right side up.)

Language

**Primary Focus:** Students will use correct punctuation to indicate plural possessive

nouns. ~~**TEKS 3.11.D.x**~~


~~**GRAMMAR (20 MIN.)**~~


**Introducing Plural Possessive Nouns**


  - Remind students that an interesting way that nouns can be used is to show
ownership. Examples are: The book that belongs to a girl is the girl’s book.
The desk that belongs to a boy is the boy’s desk. The pencil that belongs to
Mrs. Todd is Mrs. Todd’s pencil.


  - Remind students that the words _girl’s, boy’s,_ and _Mrs. Todd’s_ are called
singular possessive nouns.


  - Remind students that the word _possessive_ means to possess something or
own it.


  - Ask, “Are all nouns singular?”


» No, some are plural.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words;
**TEKS 3.11.D.x** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including punctuation marks including apostrophes in contractions and possessives and commas in compound sentences and items in a series.



Lesson 17 Informative Writing
**289**


                 - Tell students that plural nouns can be possessive in the same way that
singular nouns can be possessive.


                 - Direct students’ attention to the Possessive Nouns poster you added to and
displayed earlier and read it with them.


**Possessive Nouns**


A **singular possessive noun** shows that one person, place, or thing has
or owns something. Form a **singular possessive noun** by adding an
apostrophe and ‘s’ to a singular noun. ( _–’s_ )


A **plural possessive noun** shows that more than one person, place, or thing
has or owns something. To form a **plural possessive noun** from a plural noun
that ends with ‘s’ or ‘es’, add only an apostrophe to the plural noun. ( _–’_ )


                 - Tell students that a plural possessive noun shows that more than one person,
place, or thing owns something.


                  - Ask students to supply plural nouns that end with ‘s’ or ‘es’. (Examples could
be _rabbits, houses, sisters, uncles,_ or _foxes_ .)


                 - Ask students to think of something that could belong to rabbits.


                  - Write their suggestions on the board in cursive, following the word _rabbits_ .
For example:


                        - rabbits hutches

                        - rabbits fur


                        - rabbits babies


                  - Tell students that to show plural possessives, you only need to add the
apostrophe because the words already end with ‘s’. The difference between
singular and plural possessive nouns is that the apostrophe comes after the ‘s’
instead of before it.


                 - Add the apostrophe to the three phrases on the board, noting for students
that the apostrophe is after the ‘s’.


                        - rabbits’ hutches

                        - rabbits’ fur

                        - rabbits’ babies


                 - Tell students that plural possessive nouns are nouns that name more than
one person, place, or thing; and in this case, each phrase on the board names
more than one rabbit.


                 - Read aloud the following sentences to students, guiding them to find the
plural possessive nouns:


                        - Cats’ whiskers are soft. (cats’)


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**290**


    - Dogs’ bones are yucky. (dogs’)


    - Workers’ uniforms get dirty. (workers’)


    - Actors’ lines are long and hard to remember. (actors’)


    - Foxes’ noses are pointed. (foxes’)


    - Gardeners’ yards are beautiful. (gardeners’)


    - Students’ papers are written carefully. (students’)


  - Tell students that in the examples, the word that follows the plural possessive
noun is what those people, places, or things own. Examples are: The cats’
whiskers are soft. (The cats own the whiskers. The whiskers belong to the
cats.) Dogs’ bones are yucky. (The dogs own the bones. The bones belong to
the dogs.)


  - Reread the remaining five sentences that you read earlier and ask students

to find both the plural possessive noun and what the plural possessive
noun owns.


    - Workers’ uniforms get dirty. (workers’; The workers own the uniforms. The
uniforms belong to the workers.)


    - Actors’ lines are long and hard to remember. (actors’; The actors own the
lines. The lines belong to the actors.)


    - Foxes’ noses are pointed. (foxes’; The foxes own the noses. The noses
belong to the foxes.)


    - Gardeners’ yards are beautiful. (gardeners’; The gardeners own the yards.
The yards belong to the gardeners.)


    - Students’ papers are written carefully. (students’; The students own the
papers. The papers belong to the students.)


  - Direct students’ attention to the sentences you placed on the board or chart
paper in advance.


  - Read the first sentence to students, “(The offices of the doctors) are
crowded today.”


  - Ask, “How can we change the words in the parentheses ( _The offices of the_
_doctors_ ) to a plural possessive noun?” Students should answer _The doctors’_
_offices_ but may not include the apostrophe.


  - In cursive, write: _The doctors offices above (The offices of the doctors)._

~~**INFORMATIVE WRITING: PLAN AND DRAFT (50 MIN.)**~~


~~**TEKS 3.11.B.i; TEKS 3.11.B.ii**~~

**Structure of Writing**

  - Make sure that students have plenty of writing paper.


  - Tell students that today they will be finishing planning their informative piece
on a day in the life of an astronaut on the International Space Station.


  - Remind students that a well-written informative piece has a good
introduction, a logical structure, and key ideas and details.


  - Ask students what informational text structure would work best for this
writing project. [Answers will vary, but descriptive or chronological (time)
would work best.]


  - Explain to the students that for descriptive informational writing, they may
want to organize their paragraphs and writing by topic, such as Morning
Routines, Eating, Sleeping, etc., and give details for each of the topics.


  - Explain that for a chronological writing, they would organize it by what the

astronaut does first, what they do second, and so on. Remind students that
the readers would need clue words like _first/second_, or _first/then/next_ to
understand the chronology better.


  - Have students take a few minutes to review their plans and decide how they
are going to structure their writing.


**Writing an Introduction**

  - Tell students that writing a strong introduction, something that captures the
reader’s interest, is very important in informative writing.


  - Read the following two introductions below. Ask students which one grabs
their attention more.


    - Life aboard the International Space Station is just like life on Earth, if you
don’t mind taking a shower while floating in space or taking a walk in space!


    - Astronauts live, work, eat, and sleep on the International Space Station.


  - Explain that both of these sentences describe the main topic of the writing, but
which one makes you want to read more? (Life aboard the International Space
Station is just like life on Earth, if you don’t mind taking a shower while floating
in space or taking a walk in space!) Why? (It sounds more exciting to read.)


  - Give students several minutes to write their introductions. Then have several
students share theirs with the class.


**TEKS 3.11.B** Develop drafts into a focused, structured, and coherent piece of writing by (i) organizing with purposeful
structure including an introduction and conclusion, (ii) developing an engaging idea with relevant details.

Pausing Point 3


Note to Teacher


This marks the end of the Astronomy unit, and students have learned about
more of the universe, some of its characteristics, and important people
in the history of space travel. It is recommended that you pause here and
spend a day reviewing, reinforcing, or extending the material they have been
taught.


You may do the activities in any order or combination, using whole class or
small groups to meet the needs of the students.


~~**CORE CONTENT UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


                 - Describe methods and tools used to study space and share information.


                 - Identify and use vocabulary important to the process of science.


                  - Recall key details about the history of space exploration.


                 - Describe the life and contributions of astronaut Mae Jemison.


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Image Review**


Materials: Digital Flip Book Images from Lessons 14–18


                 - Project the Digital Flip Book Images from any Read-Aloud again and have

students retell the Read-Aloud using the images.


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: chart paper or board


                 - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word, such as _matter_ . Have
them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word.
Record their responses on chart paper or a whiteboard for reference.


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**306**


**Astronomy Bulletin Board**


Materials: drawing paper, drawing tools


  - Make a bulletin board to illustrate what students have learned in this unit.

Have students draw pictures of planets and other celestial bodies, galaxies,
eclipses, etc., or cut out images from magazines depicting these items.
Have students write a fact about each illustration. As students create,
encourage them to use complex vocabulary, including, if possible, any unitrelated vocabulary.


**Riddles 1**


Materials: paper, pencil


  - Have students create and exchange riddles to review everything they’ve

learned about in the Astronomy unit. For example, “I am a large spacecraft
that orbits, or revolves, the earth and I’m a home to many astronauts from
around the world. What am I?” (International Space Station)

**Riddles 2**


Materials: none


  - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


    - I theorized that the sun was at the center of the solar system. Who am I?

(Nicolaus Copernicus)


    - I was the first African-American woman to travel to space. Who am I?

(Mae Jemison)


    - I am the name of the mission during which astronauts Neil Armstrong and

Buzz Aldrin first landed on the moon. What was I called? (Apollo 11)


    - I am a picture that a group of stars appears to make in the night sky. What

am I? (constellation)


    - I am far from the sun and have been reclassified because of new scientific

evidence. What am I? (Pluto)


    - The axis of the earth points to me, and I show humans where to find a

northern direction. What am I? (the North Star, or Polaris)


    - I was the first satellite made by humans to be sent into space. What am I?

(Sputnik 1)


Pausing Point 3
**307**


                        - I improved upon the telescope and discovered the four moons nearest to

Jupiter. Who am I? (Galileo)


                        - I am a journey with a purpose, perhaps to the moon or Jupiter or Africa or

even across town. What am I? (a mission)


**Word Scramble**


Materials: paper, pencil


                 - Have students unscramble these words from the unit. You may wish to put

these into a worksheet that you can copy or write the scrambled versions on
chart paper or on the board.

|Word|Scrambled Version|

Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**308**


**Poster Session**


Materials: chart paper, markers


  - Divide students into small groups. Let each group decide on a key idea or

concept from their reading that can be visualized on a poster. Students
can use words or pictures to describe the concept. When the posters are
complete, hang them up around the room and allow students to walk around
to view and discuss the posters.


**Paragraph Puzzles**


Materials: Student Readers, paper, pencil (optional: sentence strips or
index cards)


  - Have each student choose a different paragraph from their reading. On a

sheet of paper, students will write out each sentence of the paragraph on
a separate line, leaving enough space between lines so that the sentences
can be cut out. Alternately, students could write the sentences on sentence
strips or on index cards. After the sentences are prepared, have students
mix up their sentences. Divide students into partners. Each partner will take
turns putting their partner’s sentences in the right order without looking at
the Student Reader. After the pairs have finished, create new partners and
repeat.


**Graffiti Wall**


Materials: chart paper, markers


  - Give groups of students a key unit concept or vocabulary words, such as

_black holes_ or _observatory_ . Have them brainstorm everything that comes to
mind when they hear the word they were assigned. Students will record their
response in both words and pictures on the chart paper. Have students do a
gallery walk of other groups’ charts.


**Multiple-Meaning Word Activity: Conducted**


Materials: chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard; images depicting the
various meanings of the word _conducted_


1. In the Read-Aloud “Mae Jemison,” you heard the word _conducted_ in this

sentence about Jemison: “She lived on the _Endeavour_ for 8 days and
conducted many experiments while she was there.”


2. With your neighbor, think of and discuss as many meanings for the word

_conducted_ as you can. (Give students a few minutes to brainstorm and
discuss. You may wish to encourage them to jot down their ideas.)


Pausing Point 3 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**309**


3. Create three columns on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard. Write

the letter ‘A’ at the top of the first column. Now ask a volunteer to come up
with a definition for the word _conducted_ as it occurred in the Read-Aloud.
Write “carried out or made something happen” next to the ‘A’.


4. Ask a volunteer to share a different meaning of _conducted_ that may have

emerged from their discussions; guide students to the second meaning for
_conducted_ . Write the letter ‘B’ at the top of the second columns, and add the
definition “directed or led” beside it.


5. Ask if anyone came up with a third different meaning for _conducted_ ; guide

the discussion to the third meaning. Write the letter ‘C’ at the top of the
third column, and add the definition “served as a route/path or direction for,
as for electricity.”


6. Read the following sentences one at a time. At the end of each sentence,

have students indicate which column the sentence belongs in according
to the meaning for _conducted_, and write it on chart paper, a chalkboard, or

  - During this week, you will be administering the Mid-Year Assessment to

students. This is a valuable time to pause and reflect on the progress that
students have made and plan to address any deficiencies that may be
appearing at this point in the year.


  - Tell students to turn to pg. 149 in the Activity Book.


  - Tell students this is a long assessment, and it is very important they do their

best. Tell students that they will be working for only 30 minutes today, and
they will most likely not finish today. Tomorrow they will finish anything they
did not finish today.


  - Remind students to take their time, work carefully, and check their work.


  - Tell students that this assessment consists of five reading selections. There

are three individual passages and one set of paired passages. Each reading
selection is followed by comprehension questions.


  - Tell students to silently read the first selection and then answer the

comprehension questions. Tell them they should refer back to the reading
selection if needed as they answer the questions. When they finish the first
selection and set of questions, they should start the second selection and
set of questions. When they finish the second selection, they should start the
third selection and set of questions, and so on.


  - Tell students to work until you tell them to stop or until they see the stop

sign.


  - Collect students’ activity pages and staple them together. You will need to

give the activity pages back to students during the next lesson if they have
not finished.

Assessment. Pass out the Silent Reading Assessment that you collected
during the previous day for students who need to finish it.


  - Ask them to resume their work at this time. Once again, urge them to take

their time and do their very best.


  - For students who have finished, encourage them to check over every single

question before turning in the assessment.


  - If there are students who have finished the written portion, today you will

begin to administer the Word Reading in Isolation portion of the Mid-Year
Assessment.


  - Students who have finished the assessment and are waiting for you to

administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment may work on activities
from the Pausing Points.


**Note:** At the end of this lesson is an analysis sheet for your use as you check
the Silent Reading Assessment.

  - Turn to the word list for the Mid-Year Word Reading in Isolation Assessment

that you prepared in advance.


  - Cover all of the words before calling a student back to you.


  - Call on one student and ask him or her to join you in the assessment area.


  - Tell the student that today he or she will read some words aloud to you.


  - Tell the student that it is important to do his or her very best reading.


  - Uncover the first row of words by moving the paper down one space.


  - As the student reads the word, mark any incorrect letter-sound

correspondences above the word on the Word Reading in Isolation Scoring
Sheet you prepared in advance. Also, note whether the student incorrectly

chunks letters into syllables, leading to mispronunciation. If the student
reads the word correctly, simply place a check mark by the word.


                    - If, after 10 seconds, the student is unable to read the word at all, simply tell the

student the word and move on. Mark an X above the word on the recording sheet.


                  - When the student has finished reading the word list, look over the chart to

note any patterns that might appear to indicate gaps in phoneme knowledge
or syllabication difficulties.

                 - Although the majority of students should have completed the Silent Reading

Assessment in the previously allotted 60 minutes, there may be a few who
have not finished. If this is the case, ask them to finish it today. You may also
want to pay particular attention to these students to find out why it may be

Lesson 6: “Who Was Annie Jump Cannon?”


Lesson 11: “All about Gravity”

**335**


**Unit 6 | Lesson 1**
**Seasons and the Equinoxes**





Today is my favorite day of the year: September 22. It’s not

just because the trees are starting to turn gold and orange and

red—though they are. It’s not just because right now you can

get the best-tasting apples of the whole year—though you can.

It’s not just because the edge of Lake Michigan is a beautiful,

shining blue—though it is.


No, today is my favorite because it’s one of the two days each





year when day and night are exactly the same length. There are only two times of the year like

this. One is on or around March 20. The other is on or around September 22. After today, nights

here will be longer, because the Northern Hemisphere will be tilting away from the sun. These

days are called equinoxes.


My aunt showed me pictures of a place in England called Stonehenge. It’s a big circle of giant

wedges of rock. Some ancient people arranged the rocks. My aunt said we don’t know much

about those people, but they must have been observing the skies and the seasons. At the summer

solstice—the longest day of the year, in June—the sun appears to set exactly in line with a gap in

the rocks. It’s pretty amazing that people who lived so long ago had the knowledge to figure out

these patterns.


We live in Chicago, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. Today, my aunt and I are going

downtown. During the fall equinox, the sun appears to set exactly in line with a gap between the

skyscrapers. It floods the streets with orange light edging across the landscape. People call this

“Chicagohenge.” I can’t wait to see it for myself.


What I find most amazing about the equinox is that people have been observing it for so long.

It’s as though, throughout the ages, people have understood how special this planet is. They

must have understood how the sun gives us just the right amount of heat—along with gorgeous

orange light. They must have understood how the trees lose their leaves and then regrow them

(and then grow apples!). And they must have understood how all of these patterns of change let

us change and grow along with them. Is it any wonder that this is my favorite day?


Unit 6 Astronomy: Our Solar System and Beyond
**336**


**Unit 6 | Lesson 6**
**Who Was Annie Jump Cannon?**





Humans have been studying the sky for centuries. Bit by

bit, scientists have gained knowledge and helped us better

understand the stars and the universe.


One such scientist was Annie Jump Cannon. Cannon was a

computer. Back in the 1890s, the word _computer_ didn’t mean

what it means today. It referred to a person who did repetitive

mathematical work. Many of the first computers were women.


Cannon worked with a number of other women in a laboratory

at Harvard University. Astronomer Edward Pickering ran the

lab. He had announced a goal of listing all the stars seen in

the sky. Once, that work would have involved telescopes.

Innovations in photography meant that the lab had images of

the stars. The computers scanned photographs of the night

sky. They counted and classified each point of light.


Two computers, Williamina Fleming and Antonia Maury, had

created a system. When Cannon joined the work, she changed

certain things in their system. She had a knack for identifying

the different forms of light that the stars seemed to give off.

She designed a system to assign the stars to different groups.

Other scientists soon recognized that Cannon was actually

organizing stars by their temperatures. Her system became

the standard way to classify stars.


New technology helps scientists find stars and galaxies that

hadn’t been visible before. But scientists still use Annie Jump

Cannon’s system to classify the stars they find.

**Unit 6 | Lesson 11**
**All About Gravity**





Gravity is a force of attraction. Gravity pulls matter—all

matter—together. You can’t see it, but you can see and feel

what it does. If you’ve ever been to the shore of a large body

of water and been captivated by the rise and fall of the water

level with the tide, you’ve seen gravitational pull in action.


Objects with great mass—that is, a great amount of matter—

have a strong gravitational pull. Earth and the sun have strong

gravitational pulls. An object with less mass has a weaker

gravitational pull. The moon has less mass than Earth, and

its pull is weaker. A house has much less mass than the moon

has. You don’t even notice its gravitational pull, but it’s there!


Mass is not the only thing that affects gravity. Distance

does too. The pull is stronger from close objects than from

those that are far away. That’s why, even when you jump, you

quickly return to the surface of Earth instead of flying through

space toward the sun. In another example, when planets

move farther from the sun in their orbits, the force of gravity

becomes weaker between the sun and those planets.


The sun has nearly all of the mass in our solar system. It is far

larger than any of the planets, even the gas giants like Jupiter.

It is larger than moons, comets, and asteroids. So the sun

has the strongest gravitational pull in the system. However, it

is balanced by the speed at which the planets move in their

orbits. Instead of falling in toward the sun, the entire system

keeps moving.
