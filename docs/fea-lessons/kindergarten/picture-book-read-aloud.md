# Reading Picture Books with Kindergartners

## What This Lesson Is About

Reading a picture book to kindergartners might look simple, but it involves specific teaching techniques that help young children develop crucial early reading skills. When you work in Ms. Wakefield's kindergarten classroom, you may lead read-aloud sessions where you share a picture book and guide students through the story using research-based strategies.

This meta-lesson teaches you how to read a picture book interactively, using three key skills from the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for kindergarten reading:

- **Making and confirming predictions** (TEKS K.5C) - Students guess what might happen next and check if they were right
- **Generating questions** (TEKS K.5B) - Students ask questions about the story to deepen their understanding
- **Connecting personal experiences** (TEKS K.5E) - Students relate the story to their own lives

You will practice these techniques with books like "Jabari Jumps" by Gaia Cornwall and "All By Myself" by Mercer Mayer, which are part of HMH Into Reading Module 5.

## Where to Find the Materials

To access the curriculum materials and digital versions of the books:

1. Go to **clever.com** and log in with your Waco ISD credentials
2. Find the **HMH Into Reading** application
3. Navigate to **Grade K**, then **Module 5**, then **Week 1**
4. **Lesson 1** contains the link to "Jabari Jumps" along with objectives, vocabulary, questions, and anchor charts
5. **Lesson 3** contains the link to "All By Myself" with its supporting materials

Review these materials before your read-aloud session. The curriculum provides suggested questions and discussion points, which give you a helpful starting place even though you will adapt them based on student responses.

## Understanding Interactive Read-Alouds

An interactive read-aloud is different from simply reading a book to children. Instead of reading straight through while students listen quietly, you pause throughout the book to engage students in thinking and talking about the story. This active participation helps kindergartners develop comprehension skills they will use as independent readers.

Research shows that children learn more from read-alouds when teachers:
- Stop at strategic points to discuss the story
- Ask questions that require thinking, not just one-word answers
- Connect the book to students' own experiences
- Model thinking strategies out loud
- Use the pictures as sources of information, not just decoration

The goal is not to get through the book as quickly as possible. The goal is to help children interact meaningfully with the text.

## The Three Key Skills

### Making and Confirming Predictions

Predicting means using clues from the story and pictures to guess what might happen next. This is an important reading skill because it keeps readers actively engaged with the text. When readers predict, they are constantly checking their understanding against what actually happens.

For kindergartners, predictions often come from looking at pictures. Before you read a page, you might show the picture and ask: "What do you think is going to happen?" After you read, you circle back: "Were you right? What actually happened?"

"Jabari Jumps" is particularly good for prediction practice because the story builds tension about whether Jabari will jump off the diving board. Students can predict at multiple points whether he will jump, what he might be feeling, and how the story will end.

To teach prediction:
- Model your own predictions first: "I see Jabari looking at the diving board. I predict he might feel a little scared because that board is very high."
- Ask students for their predictions and listen to their reasoning
- After reading, help students compare predictions to what happened: "Marcus predicted Jabari would jump right away. What actually happened?"
- Emphasize that wrong predictions are fine. The point is thinking and checking, not always being right.

### Generating Questions

Asking questions while reading is a sign of active engagement. Good readers constantly wonder about the story: Why did the character do that? What will happen next? What does that word mean? Teaching kindergartners to ask questions helps them develop this habit of curious reading.

Young children are naturally curious and ask questions all the time. Your job is to channel that curiosity toward the story. You can prompt questioning by modeling your own wonderings out loud.

To teach questioning:
- Model curiosity: "Hmm, I wonder why Jabari keeps saying he is ready but then does not jump. What do you wonder about?"
- Accept all questions and take them seriously, even if they seem off-topic
- If students do not generate questions naturally, provide sentence starters: "I wonder..." or "Why did...?"
- Sometimes answer questions from the book, sometimes leave them open for discussion

### Connecting Personal Experiences

When readers connect a story to their own lives, they understand it more deeply and remember it better. Kindergartners are egocentric by nature, which means they naturally think about how things relate to themselves. You can use this tendency to deepen their engagement with books.

"All By Myself" by Mercer Mayer is perfect for personal connections because it shows Little Critter doing everyday tasks independently, things kindergartners are learning to do themselves: getting dressed, brushing teeth, tying shoes.

To teach personal connections:
- Model your own connections: "Little Critter is learning to tie his shoes. I remember when I was learning to tie my shoes. It took me a long time to figure out the loops."
- Ask students directly: "Have you ever tried to do something all by yourself? What happened?"
- Help students see that their experiences help them understand the character: "So you know how it feels when you are trying hard but it is not working yet. That helps you understand how Little Critter might be feeling."

## Preparing for Your Read-Aloud

Before you read to the kindergartners, prepare carefully. Unlike teaching older students, kindergarten requires you to have everything ready because you cannot pause to find materials while keeping five-year-olds engaged.

**Read the book multiple times yourself.** You need to know the story so well that you can focus on the students rather than the pages. Notice where good stopping points are for predictions and questions. Think about where personal connections fit naturally.

**Mark your stopping points.** Use small sticky notes to mark pages where you plan to pause. Write a brief reminder of what you will ask. For example: "Predict: Will he jump?" or "Connect: Have you ever felt scared to try something?"

**Practice reading aloud with expression.** Kindergartners respond to voices, dramatic pauses, and enthusiasm. Practice making different character voices if appropriate. Practice showing the pictures while reading, which means holding the book to the side rather than in front of your face.

**Prepare your introduction.** Before opening the book, you will show the cover, read the title and author, and build interest. Plan what you will say to hook students into the story.

**Talk to Ms. Wakefield about the group.** Ask if there are students who need extra support sitting still, students who might need encouragement to participate, or students with relevant personal experiences you could draw on during the lesson.

## During the Read-Aloud Session

### Getting Started (2-3 minutes)

Gather students in the reading area. In kindergarten, this usually means sitting on a carpet in a designated spot. Make sure all students can see you and the book before you begin.

Show the cover and read the title and author's name aloud. Ask a question to build interest: "This book is called Jabari Jumps. What do you think Jabari might be jumping from? Let us look at the picture for clues."

Give students a purpose for listening: "While I read, I want you to think about whether Jabari is really ready to jump. Let us find out together."

### Reading and Pausing (10-12 minutes)

Read the story page by page, pausing at your predetermined stopping points. Show the pictures after reading each page, moving the book slowly so all students can see.

At each stopping point, use one of your three key strategies:

**For predictions:** "Look at this picture. What do you think will happen next?" Wait for responses. Accept multiple predictions. "Let us read and find out."

**For questions:** "This is interesting. I wonder why his dad said that. Do you have any questions about what is happening?" Or model: "I wonder if Jabari is feeling nervous. What do you wonder?"

**For connections:** "Jabari says he is not scared. Have you ever said you were not scared when you really were? Tell the person next to you about a time you felt that way."

Keep pauses brief. Kindergartners have short attention spans, and you want to maintain momentum through the story. A thirty-second discussion is plenty at each stopping point.

### Wrapping Up (3-4 minutes)

After you finish reading, close the book and lead a brief discussion. Ask students to recall their favorite part, tell what surprised them, or share one more connection to their own lives.

Reinforce the skills you practiced: "Today we made predictions about what would happen. We asked questions about the story. We thought about our own feelings when we were scared to try something new. Those are all things good readers do."

If time allows, flip back through a few key pictures to review the story sequence.

## Tips Specific to Kindergarten

**Keep them moving.** Ms. Wakefield mentioned that her students like to move. Build in small movements: "Touch your head if you think Jabari will jump" or "Give me a thumbs up if you have ever felt that way." This keeps wiggly bodies engaged without losing control.

**Use their names.** Kindergartners light up when you use their names: "Sophia made a prediction that Jabari would jump. Let us see if Sophia was right."

**Validate feelings.** Young children are still learning to manage their emotions. If a story brings up feelings, acknowledge them: "It sounds like you are remembering a time that was hard for you. That is okay. This story helps us think about those big feelings."

**Be flexible.** If students get very excited about something and want to share, let them briefly, then redirect: "I love hearing your stories. We need to save some for later so we can finish our book. Who can tell me one more thing, and then we will keep reading?"

**Use the pictures.** Kindergartners get much of their comprehension from illustrations. Spend time on pictures. Ask what students notice. Point out details that support the story.

## Why This Approach Works

Interactive read-alouds are not just a fun activity. They build the foundation for later reading success.

**Vocabulary development.** Children learn new words from hearing books read aloud. By pausing to discuss, you help cement these words in memory.

**Comprehension skills.** Predicting, questioning, and connecting are the same strategies proficient readers use. Teaching these early helps children internalize them.

**Print awareness.** When you point to the title, show how you read left to right, and identify letters, you are building print concepts kindergartners need for their own reading.

**Love of reading.** Perhaps most importantly, engaging read-alouds help children associate books with pleasure. This emotional connection motivates them to become readers themselves.

## Common Challenges and How to Handle Them

**Challenge:** Students call out answers instead of raising hands.

Kindergartners are impulsive and excited. Rather than fighting this, use strategies that work with their nature: "Everyone whisper your prediction to your neighbor" or "Think in your head, do not say it yet" followed by calling on a few students. You can also use thumbs up/down or choosing between two options by pointing.

**Challenge:** Students want to share lengthy personal stories.

Young children can turn a simple connection into a five-minute monologue about their cousin's birthday party. Set expectations: "Tell me in one sentence about a time you felt scared." You can also say: "That sounds like a great story. Can you tell Ms. Wakefield about it during snack time? Right now I want to hear from a few more friends."

**Challenge:** Some students seem checked out or distracted.

Move closer to distracted students. Make eye contact with them specifically. Ask them a direct question to pull them back in. Sometimes having a wiggly child sit next to you helps them stay focused.

**Challenge:** Students give answers that do not make sense.

Young children are still developing logical thinking. If a prediction does not connect to the story, gently redirect: "That is interesting! Looking at this picture, what clues do you see about what might happen?" Accept their responses warmly while guiding them toward text-based thinking.

## After Your Read-Aloud

When the session ends, transition students smoothly to their next activity. Do not end abruptly. Say: "We are going to put our book away now and get ready for centers. I loved hearing your predictions today."

Reflect on what went well and what you might change. Talk to Ms. Wakefield about your observations: Which students participated actively? Who seemed to struggle with sitting? Were there moments that worked especially well?

## Next Steps

After you feel comfortable leading picture book read-alouds, you might:

1. **Lead a hands-on activity** - Ms. Wakefield mentioned students enjoy manipulatives, coloring, and cut-and-paste activities. Connect a craft or activity to the book you read.
2. **Support math learning** - The Bluebonnet curriculum (Module 4, Lessons 4-7) covers composing and decomposing numbers. This involves breaking numbers apart and putting them together, using objects to make it concrete.
3. **Try a different book** - Practice with other Module 5 books to build your repertoire of interactive read-aloud experience.
