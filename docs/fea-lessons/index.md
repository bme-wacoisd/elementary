# Future Educators Academy Meta-Lessons

Welcome, Future Educators! These lessons are designed to help you learn how to teach. Each one takes a piece of curriculum and explains it from the ground up, showing you not just what to teach but how to teach it effectively.

## What Are Meta-Lessons?

A meta-lesson is a lesson about teaching lessons. Instead of teaching you the content that elementary students learn (you probably already know how to add 6 + 3), these guides teach you the methods and techniques that help young students understand concepts for the first time.

Each meta-lesson includes:

- **The concept explained clearly** - No jargon, no assumptions about what you already know
- **Where to find the source material** - Exact instructions for navigating tealearn.instructure.com or Clever
- **Research-backed techniques** - Why this teaching approach works, based on educational science
- **Step-by-step guidance** - How to actually deliver the lesson
- **Tips and common challenges** - What to watch out for and how to handle problems

## How to Use These Lessons

1. **Before your WBL session:** Read the meta-lesson completely. Pay attention to where you can find the source materials in Canvas or Clever.

2. **Gather your materials:** Log into tealearn.instructure.com (for Bluebonnet) or Clever (for HMH) and find the curriculum files mentioned in the lesson. Make sure you can access everything you need.

3. **Talk to your mentor teacher:** Discuss which students you will work with and confirm the timing of your lesson. Each mentor teacher has specific preferences and schedules.

4. **Practice:** Run through your lesson plan out loud, even if you are just practicing alone. This helps you feel more confident.

5. **Teach and reflect:** After your lesson, think about what went well and what you would do differently next time.
