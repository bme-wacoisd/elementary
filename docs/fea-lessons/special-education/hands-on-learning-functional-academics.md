# Hands-On Learning in the Functional Academics Classroom

## What This Lesson Is About

When you work in Ms. Fernandez's functional academics classroom, you will teach students with significant disabilities. These students learn best through hands-on, sensory-based activities rather than traditional paper-and-pencil work. Your role is to engage students in concrete learning experiences that make academic concepts real and accessible.

This meta-lesson teaches you how to plan and deliver hands-on lessons in math (counting, addition, subtraction within 20), literacy (letter identification and sounds), and science (five senses, magnets, and other exploration activities). Most importantly, it helps you understand how to adapt your teaching approach to meet the needs of students who process information differently.

## Understanding the Functional Academics Setting

Functional academics is a special education program for students whose disabilities significantly impact their learning. These students may include those with intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, multiple disabilities, or developmental delays. The curriculum focuses on functional skills, meaning skills that students will use in daily life.

The goal is not to cover the same material as general education at a faster or slower pace. Instead, the goal is to help each student develop skills that increase their independence and quality of life. Academic content like counting, letters, and science concepts are taught in practical, hands-on ways that connect to real-world applications.

Students in functional academics classes often:
- Learn best through physical manipulation of objects rather than pictures or words alone
- Need more repetition to master skills
- Benefit from sensory experiences that engage multiple senses
- May have communication differences and express understanding in non-traditional ways
- Require individualized pacing and expectations
- Thrive with predictable routines and clear structure

## Topics You Might Teach

Ms. Fernandez has identified several content areas where you can contribute:

### Math: Counting, Addition, and Subtraction Within 20

These foundational math skills become meaningful when taught with real objects. Instead of worksheets with numbers, students count actual items, combine groups to practice addition, and remove items to practice subtraction.

**Counting activities:**
- Counting snacks during snack time
- Counting manipulatives like blocks, beads, or counters
- Counting as students complete tasks (steps walked, items sorted)
- Counting fingers and toes
- Counting objects around the room

**Addition activities:**
- Combining two groups of objects and counting the total
- Adding ingredients in a simple cooking activity
- Adding items to a collection (put 3 blocks in the bucket, now add 2 more)

**Subtraction activities:**
- Eating snacks one at a time and counting how many remain
- Giving away items from a group
- Taking objects out of a container

### Literacy: Letter Identification and Sounds

Letter learning becomes tactile and multisensory in this setting. Students touch, trace, and form letters rather than just looking at them.

**Letter identification activities:**
- Tracing letters in sand, shaving cream, or finger paint
- Forming letters with playdough
- Finding letters hidden in sensory bins
- Matching magnetic letters to letter cards
- Sorting letters by features (letters with curves, letters with straight lines)

**Letter sound activities:**
- Making letter sounds while tracing the letter
- Finding objects that start with a target letter sound
- Sorting pictures by beginning sound
- Singing alphabet songs that emphasize sounds

### Science: Sensory Exploration

Science activities naturally lend themselves to hands-on learning. Students explore the world through direct experience.

**Five senses activities:**
- Taste tests with different flavors (sweet, salty, sour)
- Sound identification games (what made that noise?)
- Texture exploration (rough, smooth, soft, hard)
- Smell tests with safe scents
- Visual activities like light tables or color mixing

**Magnet activities:**
- Testing which objects magnets attract
- Fishing games with magnetic fishing poles
- Moving objects through materials using magnets
- Creating magnet art with iron filings

**Other exploration ideas:**
- Sink and float experiments
- Mixing colors
- Planting seeds and observing growth
- Weather observation

## Preparing Your Activity

Before your session with students, planning is essential. Ms. Fernandez mentioned she is "pretty open" and just needs to know what you will need, so think through your activity carefully.

**Choose one clear objective.** What is the one thing you want students to practice or learn? Keep it simple. For example: "Students will count objects to 5" or "Students will identify the letter M" or "Students will sort objects into rough and smooth."

**Plan for hands-on engagement.** Every student should have materials to touch and manipulate. If you are teaching counting, you need enough objects for each student to count. If you are teaching letters, each student needs their own letter to trace or form.

**Consider sensory needs.** Ms. Fernandez mentioned that hands-on activities help meet sensory needs. Some students may seek sensory input (wanting to touch everything, fidgeting, moving constantly). Others may be sensitive to certain textures or sounds. Ask Ms. Fernandez about individual student needs.

**Build in repetition.** Students in functional academics need many opportunities to practice the same skill. Plan to repeat the core activity multiple times within your session rather than introducing multiple new concepts.

**Communicate with Ms. Fernandez.** Tell her what materials you will need. She has colors, scissors, glue, cubes, and other supplies in the room. Give her advance notice so she can prepare anything special.

## During Your Session

### Starting the Activity (2-3 minutes)

Gain students' attention before beginning. You might use a song, a visual cue, or a simple statement: "It is time for learning. Eyes on me." Wait until you have their attention.

Show students what you will be doing together. Demonstrate with materials: "Today we are going to count bears. Watch me count." Keep language simple and clear.

### The Activity (10-12 minutes)

Distribute materials so every student has something to work with. Physically guide students through the activity as needed. This might mean hand-over-hand assistance, where you gently guide a student's hands to complete a task.

**Use repetition intentionally.** Do the same counting or sorting activity multiple times. Each repetition builds the neural pathways for that skill. Variation can come from changing the objects (count bears, then count blocks, then count crayons) while keeping the skill the same.

**Provide immediate feedback.** When a student does something correctly, acknowledge it right away: "Yes! You counted to three!" When a student makes an error, gently redirect: "Let us try again. Watch me first."

**Adjust to individual students.** Some students may need more support than others. Some may finish quickly and need an extension. Be flexible and responsive to what each student needs.

**Stay positive and patient.** Learning takes time for these students. Celebrate small successes. If a student usually avoids counting activities but today they touched the objects, that is progress worth acknowledging.

### Wrapping Up (2-3 minutes)

Signal that the activity is ending. "One more time, then we are all done." Provide closure so students know what to expect.

Help students transition to the next activity. This might involve putting materials away together or moving to a different area of the room.

## Important Teaching Approaches

### Use Least-to-Most Prompting

When a student needs help, start with the least amount of support and increase only if needed:

1. **Wait:** Give the student time to respond independently. Count to ten in your head.
2. **Verbal prompt:** Give a hint with words: "What comes next?"
3. **Gestural prompt:** Point or gesture toward the answer.
4. **Model:** Show the student what to do.
5. **Physical guidance:** Hand-over-hand assistance to complete the task.

The goal is always to help students be as independent as possible. If you always jump to physical guidance, students do not have a chance to show what they can do on their own.

### Honor Communication Differences

Students in functional academics may communicate in various ways:
- Verbal speech (though it may be limited or unclear)
- Sign language or gestures
- Pointing to pictures or symbols
- Leading an adult to what they want
- Eye gaze or facial expressions
- Assistive technology devices

Learn how each student communicates and respond to their communication. Just because a student does not speak does not mean they do not understand or have nothing to say.

### Follow Classroom Routines

Ms. Fernandez has established routines that help students feel secure. Learn these routines and follow them. Ask about:
- How transitions are signaled
- What songs or phrases are used for different activities
- Where students sit for different types of activities
- How materials are distributed and collected
- What happens if a student becomes upset

### Prioritize Relationship and Engagement

For students with significant disabilities, relationship is foundational to learning. Spend time getting to know each student. Learn what they enjoy, what calms them, and what motivates them. A student who trusts you and enjoys being with you will be more willing to try challenging activities.

Engagement comes before academics. If a student is not engaged, they are not learning, no matter how good your lesson plan is. Use student interests to make activities meaningful. If a student loves trains, count train cars. If a student loves music, incorporate songs into letter learning.

## What Research Tells Us

Research on teaching students with significant disabilities emphasizes several principles:

**Systematic instruction works.** Breaking skills into small steps, providing consistent practice, and using clear feedback helps students master new skills. Avoid random or unstructured activities.

**Multisensory learning enhances memory.** When students see, hear, touch, and sometimes taste or smell while learning, they form stronger memories than when they only use one sense.

**Generalization requires intentional teaching.** Students with disabilities may not automatically apply a skill learned in one context to another context. If you teach counting with bears, also practice counting with other objects so students learn that counting applies to everything, not just bears.

**Every student can learn.** Historically, people underestimated what students with significant disabilities could achieve. Research consistently shows that with appropriate instruction, these students make meaningful progress. Hold high expectations while providing necessary support.

## Common Challenges and How to Handle Them

**Challenge:** A student refuses to participate.

Do not force participation. Try offering a choice: "Do you want to count the red blocks or the blue blocks?" If the student still refuses, let them observe while you work with others, or try a different activity. Talk with Ms. Fernandez about what usually helps this student engage.

**Challenge:** A student becomes upset or has a behavioral outburst.

Stay calm. Follow any behavior protocols Ms. Fernandez has established. Give the student space if needed. Do not take the behavior personally. Students with disabilities may have difficulty regulating emotions and expressing their needs.

**Challenge:** You are not sure if a student understood.

Understanding may look different for these students. Look for any indication of engagement: eye contact, reaching for materials, attempting the task even if not perfectly. Ask Ms. Fernandez how individual students show understanding.

**Challenge:** The activity is too easy or too hard.

Adjust on the spot. If too easy, add complexity: instead of counting to 3, try counting to 5. If too hard, simplify: instead of counting independently, count together with the student while guiding their hand to touch each object.

**Challenge:** Students have very different ability levels.

This is normal in functional academics. Prepare modifications in advance. The same activity can be adapted: one student counts to 10 independently while another counts to 3 with support. Focus on each student's individual progress, not comparison to peers.

## After Your Session

Talk with Ms. Fernandez about what you observed. Which students were engaged? What worked well? What challenges did you encounter? She can offer guidance for future sessions.

Reflect on your own reactions. Working with students with significant disabilities may bring up unexpected feelings. It is okay to find this work challenging. It is also deeply rewarding when you see a student succeed at something that was hard for them.

## Connecting to Your Future

Working in a functional academics classroom teaches you valuable skills that transfer to any teaching setting:

- **Patience** - Learning takes time for all students
- **Flexibility** - Plans change based on student needs
- **Creativity** - Finding multiple ways to teach the same concept
- **Relationship** - Knowing that connection comes before content
- **High expectations with appropriate support** - Believing every student can learn while providing what they need to succeed

Many excellent teachers say that their experience with students with disabilities made them better teachers for all students.

## Next Steps

As you become comfortable in the functional academics classroom, you might:

1. **Design your own activity** - Based on what you have learned about the students, create an original hands-on lesson
2. **Take the lead on a routine** - Perhaps lead snack time counting or a morning letter activity regularly
3. **Learn about individual students' goals** - Each student has an Individualized Education Program (IEP) with specific learning goals. Understanding these helps you target your teaching
