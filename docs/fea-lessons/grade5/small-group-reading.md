# Leading Small Group Reading with Fifth Graders

## What This Lesson Is About

When you work in Ms. Key's fifth grade classroom, you will often help with small group reading instruction. While the classroom teacher leads whole-class lessons, small groups of students rotate through different stations where they practice reading skills with more individual attention. Your job is to guide one of these small groups through a focused activity that reinforces what students are learning.

This meta-lesson teaches you how to lead a small group reading session using the Tabletop Minilessons that are part of the HMH Into Reading curriculum. These minilessons are short, structured activities designed to help students practice specific reading strategies like making inferences, visualizing, or identifying themes.

## Where to Find the Materials

The materials for fifth grade reading come from a different system than the Bluebonnet curriculum you might use for other grades. Here is how to access them:

1. Go to **clever.com** and log in with your Waco ISD credentials
2. Find the **HMH Into Reading** application
3. Once inside, look for **Grade 5** materials
4. Navigate to the current module (ask Ms. Key which module the class is working on)
5. Find the **Small Group/Independent Options** section
6. Look for **Tabletop Minilessons: Reading**

The Tabletop Minilessons are physical card sets that the classroom should have available. Each card focuses on a specific reading skill and provides step-by-step instructions for leading the activity. Common minilessons include:

- Minilesson 7: Make Inferences
- Minilesson 9: Theme
- Minilesson 17: Central Idea
- Minilesson 27: Author's Craft

Ask Ms. Key which minilesson matches what the class is currently studying.

## Understanding Small Group Instruction

Small group instruction works differently from whole-class teaching. Instead of presenting information to twenty-five students at once, you work closely with four to six students who need targeted practice on a specific skill. This setting allows you to give each student more attention and adjust your teaching based on what you observe.

In a typical reading block, the classroom might look like this: Ms. Key works with one small group at a table while other groups rotate through stations. One station might involve independent reading, another might use computers for vocabulary practice, and your station focuses on a Tabletop Minilesson. Groups rotate every fifteen to twenty minutes.

Your small group is not random. Teachers carefully form groups based on which students need practice with particular skills. The students in your group might all be working on the same reading challenge, such as struggling to identify the main idea or needing more practice with making inferences from text.

## The Structure of a Tabletop Minilesson

Every Tabletop Minilesson follows a similar pattern, which makes them easier to lead once you understand the format. Here is what to expect:

**Introduction (2-3 minutes):** You name the skill and explain why it matters. The minilesson card gives you exact language to use. For example, for making inferences, you might say: "Today we are going to practice making inferences. An inference is when you use clues from the text plus what you already know to figure out something the author does not say directly."

**Modeling (3-4 minutes):** You demonstrate the skill using a short text or example from the card. Think aloud so students can hear your reasoning process. This is not the time for students to practice yet. They watch and listen while you show them what the thinking looks like.

**Guided Practice (8-10 minutes):** Students try the skill themselves with your support. The minilesson card provides practice texts or scenarios. You ask questions, prompt thinking, and gently correct misunderstandings. This is the heart of the session.

**Wrap-up (2-3 minutes):** You summarize what students practiced and connect it to their independent reading. You might say: "Remember, you can make inferences any time you read. Look for clues the author gives you and think about what you already know."

## Preparing to Lead Your Group

Before your small group session, take time to prepare so you feel confident.

**Read the minilesson card completely.** Do not just skim it. Read every word so you understand the flow of the activity. Notice where students might get confused and think about how you will explain those parts.

**Practice the think-aloud out loud.** When you model a skill, you need to verbalize your internal thinking process. This feels awkward at first. Practice saying things like "I notice that the character frowned, and I know from my own experience that people frown when they are upset. So I can infer that the character is feeling frustrated." Saying this aloud before your lesson helps it sound natural with students.

**Know the text.** If the minilesson uses a reading passage, read it yourself first. Identify the key points where students should apply the target skill. This helps you guide the conversation more effectively.

**Gather materials.** Make sure you have the minilesson card, any handouts students need, and pencils. Having everything ready prevents awkward pauses.

**Talk to Ms. Key.** Ask her about the specific students in your group. Are there students who need extra encouragement? Students who tend to dominate discussions? Students who need more wait time before answering? This information helps you lead more effectively.

## During the Small Group Session

When students arrive at your table, greet them warmly and get started quickly. Fifth graders are old enough to transition efficiently, and you want to use every minute productively.

**Set expectations immediately.** You might say: "In our group, everyone participates. I will ask questions, and I want to hear from each of you. If you are not sure about an answer, that is okay. We are here to practice and learn together."

**Use the minilesson card as your guide, not your script.** The card provides suggested language, but you do not need to read it word for word. Glance at it to remember your next step, then look at your students when you speak. Students engage more when you make eye contact rather than reading from a card.

**Ask questions and wait.** After you ask a question, give students five to ten seconds to think before calling on someone. This feels like a long time, but it allows students who process more slowly to formulate their thoughts. If you call on the first hand that goes up, the same few students will answer every question.

**Distribute participation.** Keep a mental note of who has spoken and gently involve quieter students. You can say: "I have heard from Maria and James. Destiny, what do you think?" You can also use a round-robin format where each student takes a turn.

**Praise specific thinking, not just correct answers.** Instead of saying "Good job," say "I like how you found evidence in the text to support your inference. That is exactly what good readers do." This tells students what they did well so they can repeat it.

**Redirect kindly when students are off track.** If a student gives an answer that does not quite work, do not say "No, that is wrong." Instead, try: "I can see why you thought that. Let us look at this part of the text together. What clues do you see here?" This keeps students willing to take risks.

## What Research Tells Us About Small Group Instruction

Educational research consistently shows that small group instruction produces stronger learning gains than whole-class instruction alone, especially for students who are struggling.

**The zone of proximal development.** Psychologist Lev Vygotsky described learning as happening best in the zone between what students can do independently and what they cannot do even with help. Small groups let you find that zone and work right in it, providing just enough support for students to succeed at challenging tasks.

**Increased engagement.** Studies show that students in small groups participate more actively than in whole-class settings. In a class of twenty-five, a student might contribute to discussion once or twice per period. In a group of five, that same student might contribute ten times. More practice leads to more learning.

**Immediate feedback.** When you work with a small group, you can catch and correct misunderstandings immediately. In whole-class instruction, teachers often do not realize a student is confused until they see wrong answers on an assignment. Small groups allow for real-time adjustment.

**Differentiation.** Different students need different things. Small groups allow teachers to provide targeted instruction that meets students where they are, rather than teaching to the middle and hoping everyone keeps up.

## Common Challenges and How to Handle Them

**Challenge:** One student dominates the conversation while others stay silent.

Some students are eager to share and will answer every question if you let them. Gently limit their contributions by saying: "You have great ideas, and I want to hear from everyone. Let us give others a chance to share." Then deliberately call on quieter students. You can also implement a turn-taking structure so everyone knows they will get to speak.

**Challenge:** Students give surface-level answers.

Fifth graders sometimes want to give the quickest answer possible rather than thinking deeply. Push for more with follow-up questions: "That is interesting. What made you think that?" or "Can you find a specific part of the text that supports your idea?" or "Tell me more about that." These prompts encourage deeper thinking.

**Challenge:** Students seem confused by the skill.

If multiple students seem lost, the problem might be with your explanation rather than their understanding. Try explaining the skill a different way. Use a real-life example they can relate to. For making inferences, you might say: "If I walked into school and saw everyone carrying umbrellas and wearing rain boots, what could I figure out even if I had not looked outside?" Connecting abstract reading skills to everyday thinking helps students grasp the concept.

**Challenge:** Students get distracted.

Fifth graders can be chatty and social. If students start talking about unrelated things, bring them back with: "I love that you are excited to talk. Let us save that conversation for lunch and focus on our reading work right now." Keep the pace brisk so there is not much downtime for distraction.

**Challenge:** You run out of time.

It is better to do part of a minilesson well than to rush through the whole thing. If you are running short, skip to the wrap-up rather than racing through guided practice. You can always continue where you left off in your next session.

## Connecting to Larger Reading Goals

The reading strategies you teach in small groups connect to a bigger purpose: helping students become independent, thoughtful readers who can understand complex texts on their own.

When you teach a student to make inferences, you are giving them a tool they will use for the rest of their lives. Every time they read a news article and figure out the writer's bias, or read a novel and understand why a character acts a certain way, they are making inferences. The skill transfers far beyond fifth grade.

The HMH Into Reading curriculum builds these skills systematically across the year. Each module focuses on certain strategies, and students practice them with increasingly complex texts. Your small group work reinforces what Ms. Key teaches in whole-class instruction, giving students extra opportunities to develop these crucial skills.

## After Your Session

When your small group ends and students rotate to their next station, take a moment to reflect.

**What went well?** Note specific moments when students demonstrated understanding or when your teaching strategies worked effectively.

**What was challenging?** Think about parts that felt difficult and why. Did students struggle with a particular concept? Did you have trouble managing the group? Did you run out of time?

**What will you do differently next time?** Based on your reflection, identify one or two specific changes to try in your next session.

If you have time, share your observations with Ms. Key. She can offer guidance and might adjust group placements based on what you noticed. For example, if one student seemed ready for more challenge, or another student struggled more than expected, that information helps the teacher plan more effectively.

## Next Steps

After you feel comfortable leading Tabletop Minilessons, you might:

1. **Lead a Read and Respond Journal activity** - These involve students reading short passages and writing responses to comprehension questions
2. **Support writing workshop** - Help students draft, revise, or edit their personal narratives during the writing block
3. **Help with vocabulary practice** - Lead activities that help students learn and use new vocabulary words from their reading
