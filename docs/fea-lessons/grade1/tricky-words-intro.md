# Teaching Tricky Words to First Graders

## What This Lesson Is About

You are going to teach first graders how to read and remember words that do not follow the usual spelling rules. These special words are called "tricky words" in the Bluebonnet curriculum. Other teachers might call them "sight words" or "high-frequency words," but they all mean the same thing: words that students need to memorize because sounding them out does not work.

Think about the word "said." If you tried to sound it out letter by letter, you would say something like "say-id" or "sah-id." But that is not how we actually pronounce it. We say "sed." The letters do not match the sounds in the way students expect, which makes it tricky. First graders encounter these words constantly in books, so learning them helps students read more smoothly and with greater confidence.

## Where to Find the Source Material

To prepare for this lesson, you will need to look at the original curriculum files. Here is how to find them:

1. Open your web browser and go to **tealearn.instructure.com**
2. Log in with your school credentials
3. Look for **Bluebonnet Learning Grade 1 Foundational Skills, Edition 1** in your course list
4. Click into the course and find **RLA FS1 G1** (this stands for Reading Language Arts, Foundational Skills Unit 1, Grade 1)
5. Open the **FS 1 - Teacher Guide** document
6. Look at Lessons 2, 3, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 for different tricky word activities

The Teacher Guide shows you exactly which words to teach in each lesson and gives you step-by-step instructions. For your first time teaching tricky words, focus on just one lesson's worth of words rather than trying to cover too many at once.

## Understanding the Concept

Before you can teach something well, you need to understand it deeply yourself. Let us break down what makes tricky words different from regular words.

**Regular words** follow predictable patterns. When students learn that the letter "m" makes the /m/ sound and the letter "a" makes the /a/ sound, they can blend those sounds together to read "mat." This is called decoding, and it works for most English words.

**Tricky words** break the rules. The word "the" should sound like "theh" if you follow the usual patterns, but we actually say "thuh" or "thee" depending on the context. Students cannot rely on their decoding skills for these words. They have to memorize them.

Here is why this matters for teaching: when a student struggles with a tricky word, you should not tell them to "sound it out." That advice only works for regular words. Instead, you need to help them remember the word as a whole unit.

The Bluebonnet curriculum introduces these tricky words across Unit 1:

- Lesson 2: of, is, to, all, some
- Lesson 3: are, were, have, one, once, do, two
- Lesson 9: the, who
- Lesson 10: said, says
- Lesson 11: here, there
- Lesson 12: was, when, why
- Lesson 13: where, what, which

## What Research Tells Us

Educational researchers have studied how children learn to read for decades, and several findings apply directly to teaching tricky words.

**Repeated exposure matters.** Students need to see a word many times before it becomes automatic. The Bluebonnet curriculum builds in this repetition through activities like "Tricky Word Jump" and "Tricky Word Cards." When you teach, plan to revisit words multiple times rather than introducing them once and moving on.

**Multisensory learning helps.** When students say a word out loud, trace its letters, and see it written at the same time, they form stronger memories than if they only look at the word. The curriculum includes physical activities like sorting word cards and jumping to words on the floor for exactly this reason.

**Emotional engagement improves retention.** Students remember things better when they have fun learning them. The "Tricky Word Jump" activity turns memorization into a game, which keeps students engaged and makes the learning stick.

## How to Teach This Lesson

Here is a step-by-step guide for teaching a short tricky words session. This version focuses on reviewing previously introduced words, which is appropriate for a 15-20 minute time slot.

### Before Class (5-10 minutes of preparation)

1. Check which tricky words the class has already learned by asking the elementary teacher
2. Write those words on individual index cards, large enough for students to see from their seats
3. Practice saying each word clearly so you sound confident
4. Decide on an order for your activities

### During Class

**Opening (2-3 minutes)**

Get students' attention and remind them what tricky words are. You might say something like: "Today we are going to practice our tricky words. Remember, tricky words are special words that we need to memorize because they do not follow our usual spelling rules."

**Review Activity: Tricky Word Cards (5-7 minutes)**

Hold up each word card one at a time. Point to the word and have the whole class say it together. Go through the stack once quickly, then shuffle and go through again. Watch for words that students hesitate on and make a mental note to spend extra time on those.

If students struggle with a word, do not spend too long on it in the moment. Simply tell them the word, have them repeat it, and move on. You can come back to difficult words at the end.

**Practice Activity: Tricky Word Jump (8-10 minutes)**

This is the fun part. Place several word cards on the floor, spread out so students can move between them safely. Call out a word and have a student (or small group) jump to that card. The physical movement combined with reading makes this more memorable than just sitting and looking at cards.

Take turns so every student gets multiple chances to participate. Keep the energy positive and celebrate correct answers with simple praise like "Yes, you found it!" or "Great job!"

**Closing (2-3 minutes)**

Quickly review the words one more time as a whole class. Thank the students for their hard work and remind them to look for these tricky words when they read their books.

## Tips for Success

**Keep your energy up.** First graders feed off your enthusiasm. If you seem bored or uncertain, they will lose interest quickly. Smile, use an engaging voice, and move around the room.

**Give wait time.** When you ask students to identify a word, pause for a few seconds before calling on someone. This gives everyone a chance to think, not just the fastest students.

**Praise effort, not just correctness.** When a student tries hard but gets a word wrong, acknowledge their effort before gently correcting them. You might say, "I can see you are thinking hard. This word is actually 'where.' Can you say that with me?"

**Watch the clock.** Twenty minutes goes by faster than you expect, especially when students are having fun. Keep an eye on the time and start wrapping up with enough space for a proper closing.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Teaching too many new words at once.** First graders can typically learn two to four new tricky words in one sitting. If you try to introduce ten words, they will not remember any of them well.

**Forgetting to review.** New words need practice over multiple days to become permanent memories. If you only teach words once and never revisit them, students will forget.

**Moving too fast.** Give students time to process each word. Rushing through the cards might feel efficient, but students need those extra seconds to form memories.

**Being too serious.** Learning tricky words should feel like a game, not a test. If students seem stressed or anxious, add more playful elements and reduce any pressure.

## How This Connects to Bigger Ideas

Teaching tricky words is part of a larger approach called systematic phonics instruction. The Bluebonnet curriculum teaches students to decode regular words through phonics rules while separately building a bank of memorized tricky words. Both skills work together to help students become fluent readers.

Understanding this big picture helps you see why tricky words matter. Without these memorized words, students would stumble every time they encountered common words like "the," "was," or "said." That stumbling breaks their focus and makes reading feel hard rather than enjoyable.

## Next Steps

After you feel comfortable teaching tricky word review sessions, you might try:

1. **Introducing a new tricky word** - The Teacher Guide shows exactly how to present words students have not seen before
2. **Leading a dictation activity** - Students write tricky words from memory, which is harder than just reading them
3. **Incorporating tricky words into a reading lesson** - Point out tricky words as students encounter them in stories
