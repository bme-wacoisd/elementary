# Using Curriculum Materials with AI Assistants

This guide explains how to use the Bluebonnet Learning curriculum materials with AI assistants like Claude for Desktop, ChatGPT, and others.

## Claude for Desktop

Claude for Desktop can read files directly from your computer. Here's how to use it with the curriculum:

1. **Download the curriculum folder** to your computer
2. **Open Claude for Desktop** and start a new conversation
3. **Attach files** by clicking the paperclip icon or dragging files into the chat
4. **Ask questions** about the curriculum content

### Example Prompts

- "Summarize the key concepts in this lesson plan"
- "Create a practice worksheet based on this unit"
- "Explain how to teach this concept to struggling learners"
- "Generate discussion questions for this reading passage"

## ChatGPT

1. **Copy text** from the curriculum markdown files
2. **Paste into ChatGPT** and ask your questions
3. For longer documents, summarize sections or focus on specific parts

## Best Practices

- **Be specific** about what you want help with
- **Provide context** about your students' needs and grade level
- **Review AI suggestions** and adapt them to your classroom
- **Use AI as a starting point**, not a final product

## Privacy Considerations

- Never include student names or identifying information in AI prompts
- Review AI-generated content before sharing with students
- Follow your school district's policies on AI tool usage
